            "INPUT:  She is immediately befriended by two of North Shore High 's friendlier social outcasts , the good-natured goth Janis ( Lizzy Caplan ) and gregarious teddy bear Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) . Cady finds kinship with the ostracized duo , the three of them quickly becoming best friends . But the newbie 's potent combination of beauty and brains also catches the eye of Regina George ( Rachel McAdams ) , the school 's cool and calculating Queen Bee , and she realizes straight away this newcomer has what it takes to usurp her powerful position . At the urging of Janis and Damian , Cady decides to fight fire with fire , insinuating herself within Regina 's clique of best friends , dubbed `` The Plastics , '' in order to conduct sabotage upon their collective social standing from within . Soon she appears to be every bit a member of The Plastics as stalwarts Gretchen Weiners ( Lacey Chabert ) and Karen Smith ( Amanda Seyfried ) are . Cady is strutting around the school wearing the latest fashions sporting perfect makeup . The teenager has managed to enter `` Girl World '' with high-heeled Machiavellian vengeance , turning friend against friend in a single-minded quest to end Regina 's reign , discovering in the process that life at the top of the teenage social food chain is far more addictive than she expected it was going to be . This is Mean Girls , the new film from House of Yes director Mark Waters , and it is one of the most pleasantly nasty surprises of 2004 .

            "OUTPUT:  Janis (Lizzy Caplan) is immediately befriended by two of North Shore High's friendlier social outcasts, Janis and Damian (Daniel Franzese). Cady finds kinship with Janis and Damian, the three of them quickly becoming best friends. But Cady's potent combination of beauty and brains also catches the eye of Regina George (Rachel McAdams), the school's cool and calculating Queen Bee, and Cady realizes straight away Cady has what it takes to usurp Regina's powerful position. At the urging of Janis and Damian, Cady decides to fight fire with fire, insinuating Cady within Regina's clique of best friends, dubbed \"The Plastics,\" in order to conduct sabotage upon The Plastics' collective social standing from within. Soon Cady appears to be every bit a member of The Plastics as stalwarts Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) are. Cady is strutting around the school wearing the latest fashions sporting perfect makeup.
