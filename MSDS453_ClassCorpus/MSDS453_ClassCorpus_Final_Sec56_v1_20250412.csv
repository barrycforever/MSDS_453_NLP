101,AUF_Doc1_Batman,AUF_Doc1_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"The Gotham City created in ""Batman"" is one of the most distinctive and atmospheric places I've seen in the movies. It's a shame something more memorable doesn't happen there. ""Batman"" is a triumph of design over story, style over substance  a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about. All of the big moments in the movie are pounded home with ear-shattering sound effects and a jackhammer cutting style, but that just serves to underline the movie's problem, which is a curious lack of suspense and intrinsic interest. ""Batman"" discards the recent cultural history of the Batman character  the camp 1960s TV series, the in-joke comic books  and returns to the mood of the 1940s, the decade of film noir and fascism. The movie is set at the present moment, more or less, but looks as if little has happened in architecture or city planning since the classic DC comic books created that architectural style you could call Comic Book Moderne. The streets of Gotham City are lined with bizarre skyscrapers that climb cancerously toward the sky, held up (or apart) by sky bridges and stress work that look like webs against the night sky. At street level, gray and anonymous people scurry fearfully through the shadows, and the city cancels its 200th anniversary celebration because the streets are not safe enough to hold it. Gotham is in the midst of a wave of crime and murder orchestrated by The Joker (Jack Nicholson), and civilization is defended only by Batman (Michael Keaton). The screenplay takes a bow in the direction of the origin of the Batman story (young Bruce Wayne saw his parents murdered by a thug and vowed to use their fortune to dedicate his life to crime-fighting), and it also explains how The Joker got his fearsome grimace. Then it turns into a gloomy showdown between the two bizarre characters. Nicholson's Joker is really the most important character in the movie  in impact and screen time  and Keaton's Batman and Bruce Wayne characters are so monosyllabic and impenetrable that we have to remind ourselves to cheer for them. Kim Basinger strides in as Vicky Vale, a famous photographer assigned to the Gotham City crime wave, but although she and Wayne carry on a courtship and Batman rescues her from certain death more than once, there's no chemistry and little eroticism. The strangest scene in the movie may be the one where Vicky is brought into the Batcave by Alfred, the faithful valet, and realizes for the first time that Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same person. How does she react? She doesn't react. The movie forgets to allow her to be astonished. Remembering the movie, I find that the visuals remain strong in my mind, but I have trouble caring about what happened in front of them. I remember an astonishing special effects shot that travels up, up to the penthouse of a towering, ugly skyscraper, and I remember the"
102,AUF_Doc2_Batman,AUF_Doc2_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"What director Tim Burton has managed is the rarest of transformations, releasing a pulp figure from his comic-book shackles into the maturer world of literary archetype, yet without once robbing the guy of his pop simplicity and sheer energy. The result is a picture that works on all levels for any age group. If there's a loose parallel here, it's with the first (and best) of the Superman movies, but with this caveat: Batman is to Superman what modern dance is to classical ballet. The latter hero reaches up and out; he literally flies; he's old-fashioned romance with a cheery spiritual loop (the ""only begotten son"" stuff). By contrast, this creature digs down and in (way down to the Batcave); he's new-fangled irony with a black psychological twist. Ironic, yes, yet not campy. Although the film's every frame, from the violent action to the gangsterland dialogue, is adroitly choreographed and consciously stylized, it steadfastly refuses to descend into TV-show camp. Instead, the script (by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren) wisely decides that less is more. Gone are Robin and his ""holy"" exclamations (there ain't nothing holy about this movie). Gone too are the multitude of nasties, all those hoary Riddlers and languorous Catwomen. What remains is Batman locked with the Joker in a near-Manichean embrace. This is the dynamic duo here, because they define each other as surely as hate defines love. If those pre-Socratics were right, and everything does exist in the tension between opposites, then these two don't just need each other; they are each other. It's a basic but powerful theme, powerfully delivered. First, by Burton, who loads the film with an intricate series of visual and narrative echoes, with masks and shadows and doublings. And, second, by the brilliant casting of Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the twinned antagonists. Keaton performs some allusive magic on Bruce Wayne, the mild- mannered millionaire who serves as the proverbial alter ego to our winged crusader, the anti to his hero. The script reminds us that Wayne's moral mission was born out of violence - the murder of his parents when he was a boy. The question is asked, ""What do you suppose something like that does to a kid?"", and Keaton shows us the answer: his Wayne is brittle, distracted, tentative, even erratic. When the beauteous Vicki Vale (the Lois Lane alliterative, played with a gentle vulnerability by Kim Basinger) makes an amorous advance, he hops right into bed with her, then jumps right back out again. And, in that high-tech cave beneath his baronial mansion (and his polite facade), he spies on his guests through a battery of voyeuristic cameras. This is one deeply flawed hero, Bruce Wayne as re-written by Gail Sheehy, Batman for the Gary Hart age. And the Joker? Well, duded up in bright purple like a vaudevillean clown, Nicholson is predictably, outrageously funny. ""You're insane,"" charges Vicki. ""I thought I was a Pisces,"" chortles Jack. But he too was transformed, hideously reborn, through"
103,AUF_Doc3_Batman,AUF_Doc3_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"Batman (1989) starts as billionaire Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton, of Beetlejuice), after witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, has recently begun his war on crime in the fictional Gotham City in the guise of Batman. He soon crosses paths with mobster Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson, of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and their encounter leaves Napier disfigured and driven mad. As Bruce strikes up a connection with photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger, of The Natural), Napier, now referring to himself as The Joker, begins taking over Gotham's criminal underworld. Bruce must face his past before heading out in the night as Batman to put a stop to Joker's reign of terror. This narrative serves as a near complete reinvention of its title character, especially when one compares it to the version audiences were most familiar with at the time. While Burton's take on Batman still possesses some of the camp featured in the 1960s television series starring Adam West as Bruce Wayne/Batman, this film is without a doubt darker. The film's story primarily adapts the ""Red Hood"" origin for Joker, with one noticeable twist from screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren. The pair also took inspiration for the tone of their script from comic arcs such as Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"". What we have here is a fascinating duel between two figures with intertwined fates and it presents viewers with its own interesting take on the mythology of this character. The narrative establishes a greater connection between Batman and Joker via the previously mentioned twist from Hamm and Skaaren. This not only helps flesh their individual arcs out but allows the conflict between them to hold more weight. This story feels almost timeless, even with the inclusion of a soundtrack by Prince (which is excellent, by the way). You do not get a sense of what year or era this takes place in outside of what is needed. All you need to know is that this is Bruce Wayne's early days of being Batman. Much like any old random first issue of a comic book, you can pick this up without any prior knowledge and get lost in what is told/shown within the film. Burton, Hamm, and Skaaren create a unique version of Batman, one that instantly separates himself from the moment he appears on screen. His suit ditches the blue and gray of the 60s series for a striking yellow and black, which was then made into the character's standard comic book look for several years. They also do a great job of emphasizing the struggle of Bruce Wayne balancing being himself and Batman. This depiction and the one seen in 2022's The Batman handle this issue best and incorporate it well into Bruce's arc throughout. Keaton may not have the traditional Bruce Wayne look, but for my money is the definitive version of the character. He presents audiences with a Bruce that is aloof, yet suave, one that you would not believe"
104,AUF_Doc4_Batman,AUF_Doc4_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"Created 50 years ago as a comic book hero, the character of Batman has provided the basis for numerous television and film projects as well. Through the years he has evolved into a cartoon, especially in the high camp TV series of the 1960s. The dark side of the character has now been restored in the new Warner Bros. film Batman. Produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, this Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset. The screenplay by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren (story by Hamm), based on characters created by Bob Kane for DC Comics, presents Batman as a menacing, mysterious figure and not as a hero of the people, in spite of the fact that his actions are against Gotham City's criminal elements. City officials, however, are not sure of his motives and disapprove of his vigilante approach to crime fighting. The script also explores the motivation behind the character and the psychological torment of Bruce Wayne and why he has taken on the disguise. The major strength of the film is actually its surrealistic visual style, which creates a disturbing portrait of a decaying society without structure or purpose. Production designer Anton Furst has created a Gotham City that is a dark, steaming cesspool, littered with waste and evolved as a jumble of almost every architectural style since the beginning of civilization. It is a place where it is most believable that a menace such as The Joker could seduce and possibly control the city. Contrasting this majestic visual concept is a quiet, but equally intense, human drama in which two people are trying to get together and make it in a basically hostile world. This is the uniqueness and very soul of the film and it is achieved through the beautifully defined and probing performances of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, a news photographer who is intrigued by both Wayne and Batman. Keaton delivers an especially impressive and deeply nuanced characterization as Wayne. When he takes on the Batman disguise, he becomes an enigmatic, robot-like figured without human personality. At the other end of the spectrum is Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker. It is difficult to imagine any other actor performing this character as well. And Nicholson, in white makeup with his face frozen into a menacing grimace, plays it to the hilt. The actor goes over the edge as only he can do and his performance works perfectly. Jack Palance is fun in his brief appearance as a crime czar and Michael Gough is excellent as Wayne's fatherly butler. Other performances  including Robert Wuhl as a reporter and Pat Hingle and Billy Dee Williams as city officials  are effective, although basically overshadowed by the production itself. New York Mayor Ed Koch has"
105,AUF_Doc5_Batman,AUF_Doc5_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"It's a murky, brooding piece, set in a twisted city almost choked with evil and inertia, and Bruce Wayne, half of its hero's dual identities, is very nearly in the same fix. Driven to right a naughty world the best that one man can, he's withdrawn, cerebral, severely absent-minded. As director Tim Burton sees him, he's practically the Hamlet of millionaire philanthropist socialites. When he puts on his Batmuscles and his Bathat, his Batjock, his Batgauntlets and his world heavyweight's Batbelt, almost nothing is left of him but glitteringly blue-gray eyes and a voluptuously full mouth. If a costume alone could stop crime, this one would, since it almost stops Michael Keaton. In the opposite corner, wearing purple satin, clown white, green hair and a permanent rictus, is the picture's big noise, the Joker, the dirtiest trickster since G. Gordon Liddy. Never still for a millisecond, Jack Nicholson's Joker preens and prances, drum major for a squad of sociopaths, detonating his noxious jokes like cherry bombs. (""You're insane!"" Joker: ""I thought I was a Pisces."") Director Burton has sensibly turned his back on the camp of the '60s ""Batman"" TV series, and has drawn his menacing atmosphere from the Gotham City of ""Batman's"" creator, Bob Kane. Burton read his audience right in that respect. And with the production designs of Anton Furst (""The Company of Wolves,"" ""Full Metal Jacket"") and Danny Elfman's darkly enveloping score, he has a shiveringly dense and poetic city against which to set his characters. Unfortunately, the screenplay, credited to both Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren from Hamm's story and Kane's characters, doesn't give those characters a fighting chance. It flops about, unsure of which of its scarred protagonists it finds the most seductive, and it's disastrously low on the sort of wit that can make a gargantuan movie lovable. The movie's first half hour is a thicket of exposition, yet it never answers a few basic Batquestions in every mind. The Joker we learn almost everything about: his plans to take over first the girlfriend (Jerry Hall), then the chair of crime lord Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Batman, his savvy butler Alfred (the estimable Michael Gough) and the Batgadgets remain annoyingly uninvestigated. So does the moment when Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale notices it's Bruce Wayne fiddling away in that Batcave. So Bruce Wayne was traumatized by witnessing the murder of his parents when he was 9, and that has led him into this double life of midnight vigilantism. Why bats? Wherefore bat caves? The fact that he's mortal makes him especially fascinating, yet the movie (and that Batrig) never lets us worry for a second that anything can happen to him. The volatile Keaton, an extremely interesting casting choice if he had a chance to let some of his dangerousness out, remains tamped-down and muted. His Bruce Wayne is as magnetic as one can make a character carved out of soap, but it's hardly Keaton's fault. As ""ace photographer Vicki Vale,"" Basinger again does her"
106,AUF_Doc6_Batman,AUF_Doc6_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"Critics adored Batman for its eccentric, Burtonesque take on a pop-culture icon, for its moody, noirish gothic art-deco Gotham City, and of course for Nicholson's showy performance. Comic-book fans, meanwhile, appreciated the film for rescuing the Dark Knight from the over-the-top camp comedy of the 1960s series and making him suitably dark and brooding. For all that, though, the film's flaws are hard to overlook. The story is a mess. To start with, the love affair of Bruce Wayne (Keaton) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) has no substance or emotional resonance. Bruce and faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) are constantly reminding one another how ""special"" Vicki supposedly is, though she's done little to show it, unless you count sleeping with Bruce after their awkward first date. (Peter Parker and Mary Jane's romance in the original Spider-Man is also shallow, but at least MJ is sweet and Peter is credibly smitten. Bruce and Vicki have no chemistry as well as no relationship.) Scenes and lines of dialogue make no sense. Take the bit where Bruce Wayne, protected only by a small metal tray under his shirt, gets jiggy with the gun-wielding Joker when the latter bursts in on Vicki's apartment. Forget the absurdity of relying on a book-sized tray as a bulletproof vest  what's the point of Bruce's actions? What's he trying to accomplish? What's the point of the Joker's ""Who do you trust?"" PR campaign against Batman, as if the two of them were running for mayor? This theme makes sense when it recurs in the Burton-directed sequel, Batman Returns, where the Penguin (Danny DeVito) really is running for mayor, but in the original it feels like a private issue of Burton's that's been imposed on the story for no reason. (That the Joker is crazy is not a sufficient explanation. As depicted in this film, the Joker is an ""artist""; he may be bizarre and sociopathic, but his actions are never simply irrational or pointless.) Then there are sloppy little things. When Bruce asks Vicki on their first date whether she had ""any trouble finding the place,"" it's meant to be funny because Wayne Manor is presumably a major Gotham landmark  but the movie seems to have forgotten that Vicki was just at his place for the big cocktail party. Then there's the bit in the newsroom with Vicki and reporter Knox (Robert Wuhl) musing about who Bruce Wayne really is, how there's ""nothing in his file... no photos, no history, nothing."" Hello? Nothing on Bruce Wayne, millionaire playboy? That's like saying they have nothing on Donald Trump or Paris Hilton. Then there's the depiction of Batman himself, starting with the casting of Keaton, hardly anyone's idea of an action hero. Years later, when the director was briefly attached to the long-delayed Superman movie project now in development by Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2), Burton made an even odder casting call, tapping Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel. Such eccentric choices seem to bespeak not just creative"
107,AUF_Doc7_Batman,AUF_Doc7_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"Dark, haunting and poetic, Tim Burton's ""Batman"" is a magnificent living comic book. From its opening shots, as the camera descends into the grim, teeming streets of Gotham City, the movie fixes you in its gravitational pull. It's an enveloping, walk-in vision. You enter into it as you would a magical forest in a fairy tale, and the deeper you're drawn into it, the more frighteningly vivid it becomes. Ultimately, that's what ""Batman"" is -- a violent urban fairy tale. And it's as rich and satisfying a movie as you're likely to see all year. But though it springs from American pulp origins and provides comic book pleasures, it expands upon them as well, transmuting the raw material into operatic gold. Burton's pop vitality and his ability to make the world over in surreal cartoon terms could have been predicted from ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" and ""Beetlejuice,"" but nowhere in those films is there a sign of the muscularity and emotion he shows here. Photographed by Roger Pratt, the movie is visually symphonic, with layers and layers of detail and color. Gotham City itself is both recognizable and alien, an imaginative extension of contemporary urban chaos. Anton Furst's sets have a post-Industrial Age grandeur. The buildings are heavy and squat; they're monumental examples of urban rot. Clearly, the movie's Gotham is meant to be a nightmare variation on present-day New York City. (It even has Ed Koch and David Dinkins stand-ins, played by Lee Wallace and Billy Dee Williams.) As its 200th-birthday celebration approaches, it is in the grip of a brutal crime wave, orchestrated by Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), the boss of bosses, and his head henchman, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). In his stylish threads, Napier is the most dapper of the crooks, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by Grissom's moll, Alicia (Jerry Hall), who's two-timing the capo with his lieutenant. Batman and the Joker are essentially each other's creations. The Caped Crusader brings his arch-rival to life by letting Napier slip from his grasp into a vat of toxic chemicals. What emerges from the ooze is a macabre caricature of Jack Napier. Billing himself as ""the world's first fully functioning homicidal artist,"" the Joker is an incarnation of all the indiscriminate psychopaths who kill for the sheer, exhilarating fun of it. Defacing old masters and beautiful women with equal panache, the Joker takes riotous pleasure in his evil-doing. Nicholson, too, seems to be having a blast, and he brings a sense of dangerous hilarity to the character. Dressed in lurid lavender suits with orange silk shirts and aquamarine ties, he plays his green-haired trickster as a prancing, camp maniac. Beneath the Joker's killer jokes, though, the violence is palpable. Nicholson's acting here is dexterous, dancerly; physically, he's a wild-man combination of Barrymore, Baryshnikov and Jackie Gleason. Ogling a picture of the famous photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) -- who becomes Wayne's girlfriend -- he hisses, ""She could put steam in a man's strides."" This may be the"
108,AUF_Doc8_Batman,AUF_Doc8_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"After all these years, it's safe to say that Tim Burton's entrance in to the pantheon of Batman films is an admirable effort, but one that doesn't really master the lore or the character. ""Batman"" is a very fine film. It's watchable and occasionally entertaining, but there just isn't too much fodder for the more conscious batman fan in the end. Burton does strive to set up parallels and subtext, but much of it is sadly never touched upon or explored. The psyche of Bruce Wayne is a corner of the Batverse that is never given a spotlight in ""Batman,"" and while Burton does enter in to corners of his life, there's not a lot of warmth or interest in what makes him tick. He has a gallery of various armored bodies from around the world, but there isn't a lot of reason as to why. How did the armor influence him? Did they influence him? There's never an indication as to why Bruce is tortured, if he is tortured, and Bruce's life is depicted by Burton as often very cold and closed off from the world. Rather than the Joker, Bruce becomes the target of inadvertent comedy while Joker's journey is more menacing and complex. There's an odd scene of Bruce hanging upside down while sleeping for no particular reason, and in one instance Bruce's date with Vicky Vale begins with the two sharing a dinner of soup far apart on a dinner table so long they can barely converse with one another. Bruce is of course oblivious to her desire to talk on what is obviously a date. Burton doesn't often seem very empathic toward Bruce's life and misses chances to provide insight in to what he's all about and what makes him function as Batman. In the prologue there's a fascinating parallel to Bruce's fate where we meet two parents and their son trying to catch a cab in Gotham to no avail. Anxious to find transportation they enter in to an alleyway where they're held at gunpoint by thugs who almost kill the parents. It's never pointed out how this comes close to Bruce's own fate, and the poetry of the situation is avoided. Sadly, even with his masterful comedy chops, Michael Keaton can't keep up with Jack Nicholson for most of the film, and Burton is aware of that, handing the film over to Nicholson for a good portion of the film. Surprisingly, Bruce and the Joker rarely share screen time with one another, so their war for Gotham feels detached and impersonal at times. The journey of both characters feel like two very different films. The Joker is more centered on revenge while Bruce is more prone to trying to find his place in the world. The Joker views Batman as insignificant and holds no real concern for him, while Bruce doesn't seem to understand how menacing Joker is until the climax in the city with the giant float. Only in the very final"
109,AUF_Doc9_Batman,AUF_Doc9_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"As moviegoers, most of us often fantasize about living in a place like Gotham City. The idea is intriguing because the occupants are more than they seem--men dress as bats, women masquerade as cats, mutants live in the sewers as penguins, and (maybe most importantly) monsters are perceived as saints. It is a world bound by prejudices and crime, and one that thrives on the suffering of the people who live in it. The skyscrapers tower above cloud lines, the streets are layered in shadows, and in the alleys lurk menacing dangers. No wonder its name is derived from the word ""Gothic."" The first ""Batman"" movie (in a series that now contains four entries) is a success for several reasons, but most of the credit goes to director Tim Burton's brilliant visual interpretation of a dark, ominous comic book. Like Alex Proyas, he has proven to be an artist behind the camera--someone who doesn't mind if his visual representations are odd, just as long as people are always paying close attention to them. The only real problem he faces as a director are one-dimensional characters, which are sometimes so underwritten and disconnected from their surroundings that it's as if they know they are standing on a blue screen, letting the art direction and special effects take advantage of them. As is the case with ""Beetlejuice,"" and some of his other early work, ""Batman"" is intriguing to look at, but contains very evident shortcomings as a character study. Because it's one of the better-looking Burton films, however, these kinds of inadequacies can sometimes be dismissed. Intriguingly, the first film in the nearly-extinct ""Batman"" franchise isn't remembered for its look, but for its strong performance by Jack Nicholson, who exhibits the role of the Joker in a fascinating manner. The man known as Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) witnesses the death of his mother and father at a very young age, when a madman opens fire in a dark alley. This criminal's face is cloaked by shadows, but his voice is distinctive. After the murders, we hear him speak to the now-orphaned child (""Tell me kid: have you ever danced with a devil in the pale moonlight?""). Then there is silence, and the killer disappears. The movie picks up afterwards in the present day. Wayne is not only a powerful man now, but a crime fighter, of sorts. Unknown by those of the city, he dresses up in a bat's suit, and goes by the legendary name of Batman, the dark knight. His battle against city crime is routine and standard, until Jack Napier, a high-profile criminal mastermind, is thrown into a batch of chemicals at a Gotham plant, and he comes out as the Joker, a clown-like entity who is determined to create a name for himself, even if it means exterminating everyone's favorite crime fighter. It is only a matter of time, though, until the Caped Crusader's investigations, with the help of a reporter named Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), point out"
110,AUF_Doc10_Batman,AUF_Doc10_Batman,AUF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"One of the pioneering films that introduced the modern age of the comic book movie, Batman was a phenomenon in its time. As one of those who queued outside the cinema to see it, I was very much caught up in the hype, and at the time the experience of watching it was tremendous fun. Sadly, in retrospect, it's increasingly clear just what a bad film it is, albeit a bad film with a capable director. It opens well. A well-dressed couple with a young boy wander round the streets of Gotham City arguing and searching in vain for a cab. As they drift into a dark alleyway our attention is gripped. The Batman story is legend. Are we about to see his parents getting killed? But these are not the Waynes, and these are not those dark days when Gotham went undefended. Though he's a little slow on the scene, the caped crusader's arrival, beautifully shot, is certainly dramatic, and we know these criminals will think twice about engaging in such activities again. Then it all starts to go wrong. Michael Keaton is perhaps the screen's best Bruce Wayne. His middle-aged, shy millionaire is a world away from the flashiness of Christian Bale's interpretation; but unfortunately he doesn't quite convince as the sort of man who would dress up in a rubber bat costume at night for anything other than impressing the sort of girls who make him feel awkward otherwise. Opposite him, Jack Nicholson's Joker is all ham, flashily entertaining at first but soon too obviously devoid of substance. His method of attack upon the citizens of Gotham - poisoning supermarket products - is hardly exciting, and he's terribly badly scripted, flapping his arms around and howling largely because he has nothing to say. Caught in between them is Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, a press photographer (whose camera never corresponds with her pictures), who mysteriously obsesses them both, though she has zero personality and surely can't be the only good looking blonde the city has to offer. Having seen what Basinger can do since she's grown old enough to be offered roles with substance, watching her squeal and whimper in this part now is more annoying than ever. Struggling vainly to cope with all this, Tim Burton throws in a few signature shots that are almost worth the price of admission alone, yet his distinctive style is missing from the film as a whole, so it's not visually satisfying the way that its sequel, Batman Returns, is. The overall impression one gets is that his vision has been heavily compromised by pressure from the studios involved. The film falls into a no man's land between the sublime comedy of the Adam West classic and the gritty energy of Batman Begins. Despite a handful of good minor performances - Michael Gough is the definitive Alfred - and despite some striking bits of music from Prince, it really has nothing of its own to offer."

I'd like to report a crime...I've been leaning into some old Clint Eastwood of late, these films were huge news back in the day, yet seem rather underrepresented in the 2020's, and I guess there are reasons for that. So I'm pulling my notes together to cover all five; there's not much argument that the first two (Dirty Harry, Magnum Force) are the best, the third (The Enforcer) is OK, and the last two sell the concept of a tough San Francisco cop way short. But a re-watch hasn't made me any fonder of this 1984 outing for Inspector Harry Callahan, which was one of the first X certificate movies I saw at the cinema, and didn't impress me much at the time or now. Roger Ebert said Sudden Impact was 'a Dirty Harry movie with only the good parts left in', and I'd absolutely question that judgement. If you think the best bits of a Dirty Harry movie are no-name actors arguing with each other, Sondra Locke castrating hillbilly rapists and Clint Eastwood cutting around in some awful 80's blouson jackets, go ahead and make my day, punk, because I'm not having that nor Sudden Impact. Clint's directing and producing this time around; things start out in characteristic style with bland helicopter shots of San Francisco by night to ambient jazz; he must have started a dozen movies like this. Given that most of Sudden Impact doesn't actually take place in San Francisco, it's something of a false promise; we're headed for San Paulo, a fictional seaside town of zero discernable character other than being inhabited by scumbags. But at least Eastwood looks spruce here, and we start strong as Harry irks his superiors by chasing down some passing crims who seem to have taken a hijacked a city cafe for some reason; Harry guns them down in short order and utters his new, improved catchphrase 'Make My Day'. If you've got any feeling for law and order, this is your cue to rage quit, because whatever moral compass we saw in the first few films is AWOL here. Harry Callahan is meant to be a 'walking combat zone' but is largely off screen in a convoluted narrative about how artist Jennifer Spencer (Locke) seeks revenge on the gang who attacked her ten years previously under the town boardwalk, a repulsive crime that's continually shown in flashbacks which interrupt whatever narrative flow Sudden Impact offers. And when Harry does appear, he's partnered with a farting dog, or stealing a bus full of oldies from a retirement home; Eastwood is so busy subverting audience notions of who Dirty Harry is that he neglects to provide much fan service at all, at least until his final crowd-pleasing appearance on a fairground board-walk, in silhouette, and with a halo that indicates that he's a righteous dude. It's an iconic finale to a murky, squalid film that doesn't deal well with female characters at all;"

For the first time in the ""Dirty Harry"" series, star Clint Eastwood takes over the director's chair as well. And, though it's been seven years since the previous entry (""The Enforcer""), the character hasn't changed all that much, save for a few extra wrinkles and grayer hair. Mirroring the Zodiac killer's modus operandi from the very first picture, a couple are in a car in an isolated hilltop locale when violence breaks out. However, here it's the woman who pulls out a .38 caliber gun and shoots her male companion. This transitions to a courtroom, where a judge is forced to dismiss yet another one of San Francisco Inspector Harry Callahan's (Clint Eastwood) arrests due to an illegal search and seizure. As consolation, he gets to rough up the perp with a first line of dialogue that includes the words ""punk"" and ""dog shit"" and a fist firmly clenched around the man's tie. Later, Callahan is in the familiar spot of a diner in the midst of a holdup by a gang of young black men, resulting in a show of iconic bravado and the phrase ""Go ahead; make my day"" as a goad to one of the gunmen to make a nervy move. Next, Callahan interrupts the wedding of a gangster's daughter for yet another display of machismo. This corresponds directly with the formula from the prior movies, which unnecessarily assigns two introductory scenes to establish Harry's toughness before the main plot is examined with any real purpose. And that plot involves painter and Historical Society patron Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke), a woman who finds success with morbid artwork in her ""Dark Visions"" exhibit, who must contend with the vegetative state of her sister, Beth. Beth's condition was brought about by a traumatic assault (a gang rape at a carnival, involving both of them, taking place some 10 years ago), which Jennifer attempts to avenge by going after the assailants in classic vigilante fashion. But eventually, her above-the-law antics will cross paths with Callahan (who is pressured into a vacation after all the negative publicity of his misadventures). ""You're a walking, frigging combat zone!"" Since he also operates very much above the law with his excessive use of force and reckless endangerment, it's appropriate that Harry would finally get matched up with a romantic interest harboring the same passion for justice at any cost (Locke was also Eastwood's off-screen lover during filming). But their flirtatious banter never rises above waterish and brief, and their regular run-ins appear impossibly coincidental (long before he realizes that his sexual conquest is also his murderess). Meanwhile, amid the corruption, apathy, and red tape that plague his city and job, Harry is immersed in destructive assassination attempts (including a comically impractical drive-by-Molotov-cocktailing), tongue-lashing from numerous superiors, and continual chases. The focus on action over sleuthing is much greater than before, though"

""Sudden Impact"" is probably the weakest of the Dirty Harry series not because it suffers from a lack of villains but because it has too much going on. There are so many sub-plots thrown our way that it's almost too much to keep up with at times. Dirty Harry is considered a dinosaur among a new generation of officers who don't believe in excessive force as a means of justice and Harry almost always faces consequences for his rash violent behavior. It's almost comical in ""Sudden Impact"" where Harry does something and the next scene involves some police official chewing Harry out. After Harry confronts a mob boss at a wedding accidentally giving him a heart attack, Harry is yet again chewed out and forced in to taking a vacation. The vacation doesn't go as planned as the associates of the mob boss are now intent on killing Harry, as are the petty thugs who got away with an assault due to Harry's inability to follow proper procedure. After many more shoot outs and failed assassination attempts Harry is put back on the job and sent to a seaside town to investigate a series of serial murders taking place by a mysterious assailant. Harry must now adjust to small town life, try to unwind, and dodge the assassination attempts, all while trying to figure out who is knocking off citizens of the small town. Wow, that's a mouth full. In the same time, Harry meets Jennifer, a local town resident who happens to be the serial killer who he forms a romance with, and also learns how to care for a bulldog his best friend gives him. ""Sudden Impact"" is at times like a traffic jam of different stories and characters crossing paths back and forth for almost two hours, and there isn't too much tension to go with it. Harry's adjustment to the town is barely focused on and for a long time the attempted mob assassinations become ridiculous. Especially when one of them is foiled by Harry's trusted dog Meathead. The only really interesting side plot is Jennifer's quest to avenge her and her sister's gang rape by the town's group of thugs, all of whom ravaged them near the local carnival mercilessly. Sondra Locke gives a very heartbreaking performance as Jennifer who spends her time stalking her violators and murdering them in cold blood while dealing with her own inner demons and caring for her catatonic young sister. There's so much activity in ""Sudden Impact"" that the tension the first three films perfected is somewhat missing, while Harry constantly finds himself in the middle of a violent situation he somehow miraculously escapes. Eastwood is still very good as Harry Callahan, who just can't relax even if his life depended on it, and when he's not trying to unwind, he finds himself"
114,AXK_Doc4_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc4_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact,"Before 1971, Clint Eastwood was known primarily for the long-running TV show Rawhide and his role as The Man With No Name in Sergio Leone's so-called ""Spaghetti Westerns."" That all changed during this pivotal year in Eastwood's career. In November, his directorial debut, Play Misty for Me, arrived in theaters. One month later, the world was introduced to the iconic part that would re-define Eastwood's acting career: Dirty Harry Callahan. Only once would those two aspects of one of Hollywood's most respected personages intersect - in 1983, when Eastwood made his fourth appearance as Dirty Harry and also sat in the director's chair. The film was Sudden Impact, and it is viewed by many aficionados as the best of the five movies about the hard-nosed, authority-defying San Francisco cop. The Dirty Harry films follow a formula but, within those constraints, there is room for Eastwood to do some interesting things. Despite commentary to the contrary by some pundits, Dirty Harry is not a political character and the movies are not right-wing propaganda (any more than today's 24 TV program is right-wing propaganda). Sudden Impact, like its predecessors, Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, and The Enforcer, and its successor, The Dead Pool, is less interested in scoring political points than it is keeping audiences thrilled and entertained. Sudden Impact has Harry on the trail of a serial killer, one for whom he develops a growing sense of kinship and admiration as the film develops. The killer's victims are scumbags - the kinds of people that Harry has spent his entire career trying to remove from the streets. It turns out that the vigilante has a motive and a backstory. Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) was a rape victim. The crime resulted in her sister becoming catatonic and Jennifer developing deep emotional issues. Now, in an act of empowerment and revenge, she has decided to pay back the participants in her victimization by shooting them once in the groin and once in the head. When Harry's investigation brings him closer to Jennifer and away from San Francisco, he comes into contact with a local cop, Chief Jannings (Pat Hingle), who is so belligerent toward ""Big City"" Harry that he must have something to hide. Eastwood's direction, like the plot, unfolds in a spare, no-frills manner. The killings are presented almost as stand-alone vignettes connected by strands of exposition. As the film develops, viewers become increasingly invested in Jennifer getting away with her crimes. For Harry, there's a dilemma. As an officer of the law, he's expected to bring her in, but as a man, he agrees with her form of retribution. Of all the Dirty Harry movies, this one comes closest to Death Wish territory. Harry is more of a kin to a vigilante than in any of his other films. And the bad guys are the kinds of people it's a pleasure to see eliminated. (There are flashbacks to italicize how truly repugnant they are.) When Eastwood first accepted the role of Dirty"
115,AXK_Doc5_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc5_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact,"My sister and I will never forget. Director Clint Eastwood's neo-noir rape revenge action thriller Sudden Impact (1983) is brutally grim and dark in atmosphere. I like that it has a neo-noir feel, complete with a stunning femme fatale that you're rooting for her to get revenge on sickening rapist men. Eastwood's direction is excellent and delivers vicious shootouts. Dirty Harry firing off his giant revolver is so entertaining, especially when he's just killing off heinous men. Writers Dean Riesner, Joseph Stinson, Charles B. Pierce, and Earl E. Smith neatly comes up with a dark and brooding Dirty Harry neo-noir story of revenge on sick abusers of women. I had a lot of fun with Sudden Impact. Cinematographer Bruce Surtees will use these brightly lit wide shots for action sequences, then haunting close-up shots for Eastwood and Locke that are mesmerizing. I love the unique framing for the close-up shots that every shot feels carefully executed. Joel Cox' editing is slick with very tight cuts that make Sudden Impact's 117 minutes fly by quickly. The slow zoom-ins on Sondra Locke's face are striking. Clint Eastwood is awesome as tough and vengeful Inspector ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan. His huge long barrel .44 caliber revolver is so cool as he blows away mobsters and rapists with extreme prejudice. Eastwood's hard glares, menacing frown, witty comebacks, and surprising sympathy for women this time. Eastwood is enthralling and the main enjoyment of the Dirty Harry movies, and Sudden Impact is greatly elevated by his hard boiled performance. Eastwood ensures Dirty Harry is grim and mean as ever. Sondra Locke is gorgeous and enchanting as the woman out for revenge against the disgusting sleazes of San Francisco as the spree killer Jennifer Spencer. I like that she teams up with Dirty Harry for an ultra violent revenge fantasy that's far more satisfying than Eastwood's High Plains Drifter. Her piercing deep, black eyes are hypnotizing. It's like she's dead eyed from her abuse and can only kill men to hopefully reclaim herself. Pat Hingle is funny as the irritable Police Chief Lester Jannings, who is clearly corrupt as the rapists are all close friends of his son. Bradford Dillman is fun as the angry Captain Briggs. Albert Popwell is fun as Dirty Harry's black friend Horace King, who gets Harry a bulldog named Meathead. All the supporting men are loathsome as the creeps. Michael V. Gazzo is hilarious as mob boss Threlkis, who immediately has a heart attack, causing Dirty Harry to have thugs shooting at him throughout Sudden Impact. Composer Lalo Schifrin provides ambient moody jazz for his eerie film score. It sounds like a film noir score, which matches the neo-noir atmosphere of Sudden Impact. Sound designers Bub Asman, Rick Alexander, Alan Robert Murray, Les Fresholtz, Robert G. Henderson, Vern Poore, and Donald F. Johnson let gunshot noises ring out loud and clear with huge explosive echoing. Makeup artist Barbara Guedel makes Sondra look super pale and pretty. Hairstyling from Marlene D. Williams styles Sondra"
116,AXK_Doc6_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc6_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact,"The best of the Dirty Harry series following the original classic, stands apart certainly as the darkest entry of the films. Eastwood's direction manages to balance the more crowd-pleasing elements of Harry Callahan's one-man war on crime and bureaucracy with the rather tense and unsettling revenge tale of Sandra Locke's character. The film affords the Jennifer Spencer considerable screen time and Eastwood goes quite far in exploring both her rather psychotic edge as well as the root of her behavior in a gang rape scene that is particularly strong and unsettling. Her character's rage is a perfect counterpoint to Callahan's attitude toward law enforcement and its clear that he finds himself surprised but understanding of the Spencer character. Also noteworthy is Pat Hingle, returning opposite Eastwood from their casting in Hang 'Em High and The Gauntlet. The film is not all darkness with some rather weak dog humor that proves Micheal Bay is not the only action director obsessed with ugly dogs. Of course the film features the definitive Eastwood line. Its rather amazing to think that its not till the 4th entry that Dirty Harry's most iconic moment arrives in the classic, 'Go ahead, make my day."" The film's final act is quite impressive unfolding almost like a horror movie in its cinematography and editing as Locke is victimized again and Eastwood returns from certain death to exact justice. The silhouetted shot of Dirty Harry coming down the fairway with his massive pistol in hand is akin to any number of slasher movie icons from Freddy to Jason in its fearful atmosphere. Callahan's final decision to cover for Spencer is striking when it happens and is perhaps how the Dirty Harry series should have been left to end. Clint Eastwood is Detective Harry Callahan in SUDDEN IMPACT, the third sequel to DIRTY HARRY. This is probably the most violent film of the series. I can understand the weak rating given by professional critics for this film. Hell, I like Dirty Harry and Clint Eastwood... could care much less for his real life Sondra Locke wife to be, however. She is not much of an actress. That said, Harry punchs, shoots and threatens his way out of many a predicament in this 3rd installment in the Detective Hallahan series. Yes, he has no backing and indeed is berated for his brutality by his superiors of the San Francisco police department. This time Harry gets to meet a really bad ass woman who likes to orchestrate gang rape to a very young girl as well as her older sister (Sondra Locke). Well the intensity builds as Harry goes looking for the culprits and finds the ringleader a candidate for your worst date USA. The poor wretch that was cast for this film was superb. She makes anyone's flesh crawl. But Harry gets to punch her in the face, or kick her behind, can't remember which. Full of payback, get this and feel justice is vindicated, at least for once and watch"
117,AXK_Doc7_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc7_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact,"It's barely passable. The acting is the definition of nothing special. It actually starts out decent with Harry in the first half hour but once Jennifer comes into play and gets more screen time the quality really goes down and the villains, aside from the fact there are way to many, generic, the main one is so comedically stupid and over the top. Harry just disappears in this really by the second half. The music is the best thing being half decent but it doesn't have any of the catchiness or tone of the previous entries. It's very 80's ballad and dated cinematic score that stands out but doesn't really fit a movie like this. The pacing isn't that good, and the editing, cinematography is just ok. This jumps around constantly in the middle once Harry leaves San Francisco with killings that don't really add up to much plot wise. The biggest problem of all is Jennifer is so wooden, uninteresting, lacks any emotion, and has no chemistry with Eastwood. There is tons of kills in this but it feels like this is a exploitation flick like Death Wish rather than Dirty Harry by the middle and end. It does come back in the last few minutes but and barely works overall. The whole crime boss at the start also feels completely pointless and could've been cut out. The commentary potential of rape victims and vigilantism are cast aside in favor of a more tame I spit on your grave style plot. When Harry lets her go, it feels empty because we barely see them together. Most of the second half is just her killing people and Harry doing dumb stuff with the peeing and farting dog. Only real thing entertaining is there are lots of kills in this so it never gets boring but it never goes anywhere either. The Semi-Auto .44 is kind of cool. If your a die hard Eastwood or Revenge Killing movie fan check this out otherwise most people should skip this. It's so forgettable despite it's one famous catch phrase. It's an improvement on 'The Enforcer', if still short of 'Dirty Harry' and 'Magnum Force'. Clint Eastwood (also dir.) remains the constant high of these films, as the American rattles off a famous catchphrase in this installment. Sondra Locke is very good behind Eastwood, she's arguably the most standout support cast member from the whole series (thus far) to be honest. A deep storyline coupled with all the usual things you get from this set of films and you have with a suitably entertaining flick. Interested to see how it all wraps up with finale 'The Dead Pool'."
118,AXK_Doc8_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc8_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact,"Virtually indistinguishable from The Dead Pool in spite of the slightly different stories. Harry must stop someone who is like himself, and like the guy in The Dead Pool, but who doesn't have a badge, so can't flagrantly violate US constitutional procedure. What Siegel and Eastwood were trying to sell, they sold, because since the release of their flicks, there have been widespread changes in laws and law enforcement in the United States. Eastwood's beau Locke is in the film who is a lot like Ireland is to Bronson. Maybe that's why Harry shows a feminist touch, don't worry, he gives feminism a new conservative touch. Probably the worst of the franchise. Harry still fails miserably to adjust himself as a cop in a civilized society and the rants with his superiors makes him look even non-contemporary. Good thing is the premise moves into a small town and the change of scenery adds some freshness. The monotonous introduction, repeated formula tricks makes you appreciate the first two movies even more and to see the charming, stylish, young and dynamic cop turn into a grumpy old man with no vertical progress in his career. Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) attracts a lot of heat on him by confronting a mob boss resulting in repeated personal attacks and increasing body count. When his bosses run out of patience, they assign him an investigative task in a small town San Paolo connected to a homicide. Jennifer Spencer (Sandra Locke), a rape victim is exacting revenge on her aggressors systematically with a similar modus operandi. His introduction to Jennifer and move to San Paolo gets him attached to the case professionally and personally. Clint Eastwood the director we have come to admire and respect is nowhere seen in this early venture with a boring screenplay and formulaic setup. Clint Eastwood looks older and less agile making the action and chase sequences look unrealistic. Though there are a couple of good plot twists and thrilling sequences, the runtime and leisure pacing does not help the cause. Sandra Locke's performance was robotic and does not induce any emotional connect even with the horrific ordeal she has been through. The main antagonist's histrionics like in other episodes tries to be too psychotic making you cringe. 'Harry, you are a dinosaur' was the most relevant dialogue in the entire movie. Quite forgettable. Eastwood is still good as Harry, OK in the direction and the new thing is to have a woman as the main criminal but that's it. 80's music arrive to wipe out one of the few things that were good about these movies. The plot is really bad. Quite an example of early 80's movies."
119,AXK_Doc9_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc9_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact,"Clint Eastwood takes the Director's seat for the fourth installment in the Dirty Harry series. Critic reviews stated the antagonist of this film was cardboard and plot was messy. Those statements easily applies to the previous film. While the plot of this film isn't original by any means, what's here is engaging and overall this feels like a traditional Dirty Harry film where as the previous film didn't. Not the best in the series, but a much better film than The Enforcer. Overall, I really liked it. I like Dirty Harry's approach to police work and I loved watching him administer justice on the streets to the dismay of his long suffering superiors. It's as if he deliberately goes out of his way to cause mayhem at every opportunity which I found satirically very amusing. The supporting cast are very funny as well. The Mayer, police chief, cafe robbers, woman in the bar, pensioners on the bus, even the serial killer Jennifer and her rapist victims are all fun to watch. It's a shame it has to carry an 18 rating. My only criticism is that I would have liked all of the scenes to have been played out in daylight. For example, in the fairground scenes at the end I found it difficult to see some of what was happening. Idc what people say, this movie is awesome. Clint Eastwood delivers one of the best movie insults/threats of all time in the first 5 minutes, as well as the iconic line ""Go ahead, make my day"" in the next scene. So many awesome moments in this movie. The shot/scene with him at the carnival/docks where he faces all 3 bad guys in the dark shadow that covers his face from the distance is genius cinematography/directing/filmmaking. I even liked the villains and how they acted for who they were! As far as I'm concerned, this is a classic Dirty Harry movie that is on par with the original from 1971! Clint Eastwood has been, is, and will always be a legend on the big screen! An improvement on 'The Enforcer', if still short of 'Dirty Harry' and 'Magnum Force'.

120,AXK_Doc10_Sudden_Impact,AXK_Doc10_Sudden_Impact,AXK,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact,"It's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly (if only in comparison to other films in its legacy), and others in a 'sub-plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong. Sudden Impact is one of those cases, where Clint Eastwood as star/producer/director shows when he can be at his best, or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime/mystery/detective story in his Dirty Harry fame. We get that 'make my day' line, and un-like in the first film where his 'do I feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails, here it's switched around. He gets into another shamble with the department, as usual, when he tries to fight crime 'his' way, in particular with a diner robbery (inspiration for Pulp Fiction?) and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus. He's told to 'take a vacation', and that's the last thing on his mind. This whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines, which just adds to the frustration. But soon his story merges with the sub-plot that Eastwood develops from the start. Enter Sandra Locke's character, Jennifer Spencer, whom we soon learn after some (appropriately) mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel, unjust sexual assault (err, outright rape), and is sleekly, undercover-like, getting revenge. Her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film, the most intense, and finally when it goes into Callahan's storyline (he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder), the film finally finds a focus between Eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs. evil (though sometimes blurred, to be sure). Eastwood films the flashbacks, not to say too much about them, expertly, in a fresh, experimental style; the trademark Lalo Schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others. It almost seems like a couple of times an art-house sensibility has crept into Eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style, which helps make the film watchable. It's a shame, though, that in the end it goes more for the expectable (or maybe not expectable) points, and until the third act Callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith...Wesson...and me' shtick. However, with Locke he gets out of her a very good performance (more subtle and touching than the one in the Gauntlet) and an exciting climax at an amusement park. In a way I do and don't agree with Ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in Eastwood's style here. I admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both, the directness, but the scenes where Eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video. It's cheesy, it's hard-edged, it's not up to par with the first two 'Harry' pictures, but hey, there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the"

The film used some familiar approaches, but it also featured a good, creepy story and two very compelling characters. It was a wonderful horror picture and a surprise box office hit. With a modest $20 million budget the film managed to earn $320 million which pretty much guarantees a sequel in today's Hollywood. Now it is 2016, the horror genre is still pretty bland and stale, and along comes ""The Conjuring 2"" to give it another swift kick in the pants. James Wan returns to direct and co-write this second installment of the terrifying adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. This time he is give $40 million and already the film seems on track to bring in a big return. conjuring1 Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as the Warrens this time six years after the events of the first film. It is 1976 and they are fresh off their most publicized case in Amityville, New York. During the encounter Lorraine experiences a horrifying vision which haunts her well after the case ends. Due to her fears the couple agree to step away from their supernatural investigations. One year later a single mother named Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children believe they are being haunted by a violent spirit in their London council house. The Catholic Church asks Ed and Lorraine to go to London to see if there is any validity to the claims. Upon arrival they find that the spirit seems to have targeted 11 year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe). The Warrens witness a series of anomalies and must determine the true cause. The Warren characters we get may be fictionalized versions of the real people, but Wilson and Farmiga bring such personality to each. They still have the same wonderful chemistry and the script smartly manages to further explore their relationship through the events they are experiencing. Their mutual love and faithfulness is something refreshing and unique. I love these two characters and the two performances. A surprising amount of attention is given to the Hodgson family. Some may struggle with Wan's pacing, but he intentionally spends time developing their relationships, their social and economic struggles, and of course the frightening things that begin happening in their home. They are easy for us to care for. The writers simply don't allow them to be disposable characters. conjuring2 But first and foremost this is a horror movie and thankfully it is every bit as good as its predecessor. The film has its share of jump scares which Wan can build up to better than anyone. But he is more focused on the unsettling creepiness of what his audience sees. So many moments brim with tension simply based on the way Wan deliberately orchestrates the scene or moves his camera. And once again he doesn't have to rely on blood and gore despite"

In fact, during the film's prologue, the Warrens appear at the Amityville house, where previous owners claimed a demonic presence drove them out. During a seance, Lorraine tries to make contact with whatever may be haunting the house, and she sees a horrific premonition. ""That's as close to Hell as I want to get,"" she tells her husband after coming out of her trance with a gut-wrenching scream. The audience can't help but react to several effective jolts and unsettling moments during this sequence, and the titles haven't even appeared onscreen yet. A masterful screw-turner, Wan's sequel to his 2013 hit The Conjuring doesn't dwell on the Amityville case, although what happens in Amityville doesn't stay in Amityville. As we learn, that case was contested in the media, while the Warrens' respected names were unduly tarnished. Wan and his three credited screenwriters use Amityville only for dramatic backstory, despite how the name alone could draw audiences. Indeed, the Amityville case hangs over the heads of our two investigators, once again played with warmth by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. And, along with the sequel's 133-minute runtime, the story's concern for characters over profits should tell you The Conjuring 2 is more than another cash grab like the 2014 prequel, Annabelle. Then again, they've injected gimmicks elsewhere to ensure the sequel performs just as well as the original (earning $137 million on a $20 million budget). Wan wants you to care about Ed and Lorraine Warren, and by choosing the suitable case through which these characters grow, he makes a better kind of exorcism film. After creating a wholly satisfying movie version of the Warrens' 1971 event at the Perron family home in Harrisville, Rhode Island, Wan's saga moves ahead to 1977. The location is Enfield, London, in a dilapidated council house that should be condemned. There, troubled single mother, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), looks over her four children, all of whom suffer from a presence in the housethe voice of an old man speaking from within the dark: ""This is my house,"" says the man in a gravelly voice. Peggy's stuttering, biscuit-obsessed youngest, Billy (Benjamin Haigh), is taunted by his toy firetruck, as well as his creepy zoetrope figure called ""Crooked Man"" and its accompanying song. But the poltergeist's main target is Peggy's middle daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), who becomes the spirit's plaything. After Amityville, Lorraine feels reluctant to accept another case. But Ed's good-hearted, helping nature convinces her, despite a warning from a particularly spooky demonic presence that has followed her since Amityville. So the Warrens head to London, conspicuously leaving their teenage daughter home alone during Christmastime, and team up with a resident skeptic (Franka Potente) and British paranormal researcher (Simon McBurney) to investigate the Hodgson home.

From the original ""Saw,"" to the two ""Insidious"" films and the first ""Conjuring"" (and to a lesser extent his sophomore effort ""Dead Silence""), he has demonstrated a keen eye for setting up tension, as well as knowing just the right moment to release it. While his brief detour into the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise showed he has the potential to be more versatile than just a horror director, he has returned to scare audiences once again with ""The Conjuring 2."" Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are in the midst of investigating the infamous Amityville house when Lorraine has a vision of a white-faced demon dressed like a nun. This vision haunts her well beyond Amityville, following them to their own home. It frightens Lorraine so much that she asks Ed if they can take some time off from their investigation activities. In the meantime, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children are experiencing strange occurrences at their house in the London borough of Enfield. Her daughter Janet ends up becoming the focus of the malevolent spirit haunting their home. She has terrible nightmares, is teleported to other rooms while she sleeps and, eventually, becomes the conduit for the spirit's voice. Enough public attention begins to surround the haunting that the church asks the Warrens to investigate. They reluctantly agree, joining the paranormal investigators who have already been on the case, a couple of whom believe that this is a hoax. ""The Conjuring 2"" is a strong follow up to its utterly frightening predecessor. Wan uses that expert eye to ratchet up the tension during the scare scenes, including many creative camera angles and lens choices to focus our attention to certain areas of a shot, which may or may not be where you should be looking. He also loads the film with plenty of jump scares, the hallmark of many a ghost story. While there are several nice and spooky moments throughout the movie, overall it's not quite as scary as the first outing with the Warrens. This is not a bad thing, though. Let me explain. ""The Conjuring 2"" is an anomaly among horror sequels. Almost all of them to this point have focused on the villain: Your Jason's, Freddy's or Ghostface's. The ""Conjuring"" films are focused on the Warrens. This brings a whole different dynamic to them. Instead of straight-forward horror, these films are essentially spooky relationship dramas. The Warrens know the dangers they face every time the take on a new case, yet they know, or at least hope, that their love for each other and devout faith will get them through it. This time around, though, Lorraine is very concerned that things might turn out different. It's not just the Warrens' relationship that the films focus on, though. In both movies, we get to know the families being affected,"

125,BXB_Doc5_The_conjuring_2,BXB_Doc5_The_conjuring_2,BXB,Horror,Positive,The_conjuring_2,"Following up on a movie that in many senses revamped the horror genre and scared the bejeebers out of the whole world is a tall order. But James Wan's sequel titled a simple The Conjuring 2 is a definite upgrade. It follows the same format as before. It makes the paranormal investigator couple, The Warrens the protagonists, it makes a helpless family the victims and it takes a vicious demon to create the scares. The script formula is nearly identical to The Conjuring from 2013. But what changes in the movie are the treatment and the details. Wan trades the big scares for building the mood and atmosphere. The Conjuring 2 creeps you out. It plays tricks with your mind. It builds up the tension and it does not resort to as many jumpy scenes as you expect in a horror film. But it does terrorize you with its slow, eerie build up. The first half of the movie is a spectacle in thrills. The Warrens are shown to be investigating the Amityville haunting case in New York. The after effect of the case is that Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) gets caught up in the supernatural traps of a powerful demon that looks like a dead nun, but is definitely twice as frightening as Bathsheba from The Conjuring. In Enfield, England a family consisting of four children and a single mother start getting terrorized by a vicious spirit in their house. The spirit claims to be the original owner of the house and he takes control over one of the children, Janet. As the plot thickens, like in the first film, the Warrens become saviours for the family in fright. The original movie had some memorable scenes of haunting in its build-up. The match lighting scenes in the cellar as well as the closet scenes have now become part of horror hall of fame. While The Conjuring 2 has a distinct absence of such outstanding scenes, the first half's build up is a lot more eerie than before. It doesn't jump at you, but it tightens a noose of terror around you, making me you feel uneasy and jumpy as the kids in the house are frightened by the angry spirit. The key element here is the production design. The old English house of wood and stone looks like a damp and dark place. It's the perfect setting for paranormal experience. The retro vibe really adds a touch to the film. The camera work is also great. The frames are compact and up-close to not just characters and set props but even the ghosts. The result is that you can feel the fear and the horror up-close. The scary set-pieces on offer in this movie are just phenomenal. Hold on to your nerves in the scene where Lorraine gets stuck in Ed Warren's office. It's bound to make your skin crawl with fear. It's sad then that the second half of the film resorts to the usual 'in the name"

That's a scary image, no? It's weird and funny and wrong and totally transfixing - it makes you want to see more. Well apparently director James Wan agreed, but in this case ""more"" turned out to be ""too much."" That shot actually never ends up in the final movie - what does end up in the movie is a CG'd tangle of technicolor monstrosity, a so-called ""Crooked Man"" (which is admittedly a terrific little moniker) twitching and banging down the haunted house's hallways, poking its Burton-esque umbrella through walls and spoiling all the fun. It's disappointing because the original film, for all its flaws - and I wasn't as enamored with it as most people seemed to be - knew how to keep itself situated firmly inside its own walls. Yes it was the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach, but of the old-fashioned sort just turned up to twelve - you want some jump scares we'll give you eleven jump scares. That sort of thing. And a lot of the sequel sticks to that routine too, until that blasted special effect, a silly goosed Babadook, stampeded across my patience. The Crooked Man is a problem, but he's only one trick up the movie's sleeve, and as with the first film it's got more arms than it can handle, so even with some wonky ones some of them still turn out to work. Wan's ripping himself and my preferred horror franchise of his (the Insidious movies) off with that Nun Demon thing... not to mention the Adrienne Barbeau classic The Convent... ... but the Nun Demon thing (and every time I write that I imagine Nicolas Winding Refn's film The Neon Demon actually being called The Nun Demon and my mind reels) is a blast all the same, I giggled and cringed every time it showed up. It's perfectly silly and appropriate for this franchise's universe, and I liked it very much. Also as a spoilery side-note do take note of the mid-film scene set inside the Warrens house where Vera Farmiga's at the kitchen table -- if you look behind Vera, and I mean if you look behind her from all the multiple angles the movie shows her from, you will see a certain name that will come in handy to remember for later in the film. It is ridiculous - the name is on every wall of their house, and their daughter is making a beaded-necklace with the name in it. Anyway I appreciate The Conjuring films and what Wan's trying to do - jumble the haunted house genre into door-creaking chaos for the next generation - more than I ever entirely enjoy them, much less find them all that frightening. Part of me appreciates their dopey sincerity in relation to religiousness, and part of me is unable to suspend my disbelief in order to catch myself"

Perhaps expectations were a little too high. The Conjuring (2013) was a surprise for mainstream horror, telling a spooky tale with effective craftsmanship from director James Wan and strong performances by the lead actors. Realizing that many of the same faces return for the sequel, including Wan, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, along with screenwriter Chad Hayes (accompanied by Carey Hayes, Wan, and David Leslie Johnson), we would expect this to be a strong entry in the franchise. Instead, what we get is a bad case of ""sequelitis""  a movie trying to capture old magic by doing the exact same things over again. What made the first Conjuring work so well was how Wan kept the narrative driving forward. There was constant momentum; the pacing was crisp and clean. Everything fit together  even the twists and turns felt appropriate. This time, the plot is stretched out. At a bloated two hours and thirteen minutes, the story is way too thin to keep us engaged for that long of a runtime. Just as before, paranormal investigators Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Farmiga) are called upon to check the validity of a recent haunting. This time, they're summoned to London to help a mother named Peggy (Frances O'Connor) whose family has been tormented by an evil spirit, specifically targeting her daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe). Conjuring 2 Movie Still 1 It takes over an hour of screen time for the Warrens to arrive in London. This is where the lack of pacing rears its ugly head. The production prolonged the story as much as they could, stuffing it with unnecessary side plots and repetitive haunting scenes. One of the selling points was that it's based on a true story. Ed and Lorraine Warren were real investigators, known for taking on the infamous Amityville murder case. The Amityville house has nothing to do with the events happening in London, and yet we're forced to watch an early scene of them searching it. It's meant to hone in on the familiarity of that case, but it doesn't work because how separate it is from the main thread. There's an effort to tie it in using Lorraine's visions as a kind of spiritual foreshadowing, but it's flimsy at best. James Wan has proven himself to be a competent technical director. Even if he employs the ""jump scare"" too often, he knows how to craft them to get the biggest reaction out of an audience. He has a keen sense of directing a viewer's eye, forcing them to look at one section of the screen and then punch in the scare from another section. In the trailer, there's a moment when Janet is in a room by herself, the camera circling around her. To maintain our focus, crosses are fixed to the wall, and as Janet looks around the room, the crosses start to turn by themselves (a classic horror"

They were frightened. They were grossed out. And they were shocked. But in the end, they were thrilled. Based on the best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty, ""The Exorcist"" used a real-life case as its basis. But Blatty changed several aspects of the incident, and as Friedkin's screenwriter of record, he included those changes in his screenplay. One thing that neither Blatty nor Friedkin resorted to, however, was claiming that their work was ""based on actual events."" They took a riveting story  one that, Friedkin later claimed, was a study of ""faith""  and made a movie that many consider one of the scariest of all time. That was then, though. And, changing with the tenor of the times, James Wan has adjusted accordingly. Known mostly for having co-created the ""Saw"" series  the films that helped spawn the sub-genre of torture-porn  Wan has become a virtual publicist for the QUOTE-UNQUOTE paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Based mostly on their association with the case popularly known as ""The Amityville Horror,"" the Warrens established a reputation. And based on that reputation, they are the stars both of Wan's ""The Conjuring""  which was released in 2013  and now ""The Conjuring 2."" This new film is a retelling of a 1977 English case the Warrens apparently checked out. And by saying ""checked out,"" I'm being generous. According to the website History vs. Hollywood, the Warrens were just two of many investigators who visited a house in the North London suburb of Enfield allegedly haunted by a poltergeist. In fact, the site says, ""most articles about the Enfield Poltergeist don't even mention the Warrens."" Never one to let facts get in the way of a movie plot, director Wan and his team of screenwriters put the Warrens  again played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga  at the center of the story. Called by the Catholic Church to investigate  the Warrens and Church officials seem to be on first-name bases  Ed and Lorraine travel to London, camp out in the Enfield home of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children. They're particularly interested in Hodgson's 11-year-old daughter Janet (played alluringly by Madison Wolfe). What they find would creep out Bram Stoker. Mysterious noises. Slamming doors. Strange entities. Crosses that turn upside down on their own volition. A levitating Janet. And so on. And while the movie, through the Warrens, seems to address the understandable skepticism that the real-life Enfield case aroused, it does so in a way designed to act as the straw-man argument the movie then rebuts with spectacular computer-generated bombast. But as has been proven time and again with computer-generated imagery, camera tricks aren't a good substitute for actual dramatic flair. After the first half"
129,BXB_Doc9_The_conjuring_2,BXB_Doc9_The_conjuring_2,BXB,Horror,Negative,The_conjuring_2,"The Conjuring was one of those rare kinds of of horror movies: An impressive cast, some solid scares, and almost universal critical praise. A sequel was inevitable, especially since there's a tall pile of stories to choose from involving real-life ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren, (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). The Conjuring 2 begins in 1977, with the Warrens' involvement in the aftermath of the ""Amityville Horror"" case, and them trying to fight the growing public belief that the whole thing was a hoax. They, of course, have no doubts it was all true, especially after Lorraine sees a demon that looks like Marilyn Manson in a nun habit walking around the house's basement. This demon follows them home, and its presence, and visions of Ed's death, convince Lorraine they should stop taking cases and instead stay home and continue to ignore their teenage daughter. (Seriously, I was convinced she was a ghost, there's so little attention paid to her.) Meanwhile, in Enfield, England, newly divorced mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children are dealing with weird things in their new home. And I'm not talking about the house's disturbingly dirty walls, or the four foot deep bog of water in the basement. Strange noises, furniture being pushed by invisible hands, and youngest daughter Janet's (Madison Wolfe) sleepwalking/sleeptalking episodes eventually force the Hodgson family to, in one of the film's welcome moments of levity, literally run out of the house screaming. Janet becomes the focus of a ghost named ""Bill,"" who speaks through her in a chain smoker's rasp, claiming the house is his, and that he died in a old leather armchair in the living room. That's the kind of information that would have me instantly picking up the phone to schedule a big trash day pick-up, but of course the Hodgsons decide to keep it. (It really does tie the depressingly decrepit room together.) The case becomes the focus of a BBC special, (you can watch the real one here), and when none of England's supernatural investigators are able to help the family rid themselves of Bill, the Warrens are called in by the Catholic church, to see if they can prove the haunting is real, so the church can do a sanctioned exorcism. So, despite Lorraine's misgivings about taking on cases, and despite it being Christmastime, and despite them having a teenage daughter who would probably like to spend that Christmas with her creepy parents, the Warrens arrive in England to do some ghost busting. The Enfield case has been called England's Amityville, and it's true there are similarities, the biggest being they were both eventually deemed enormous hoaxes. The real Janet was caught on film banging a broom on the ceiling, bending spoons, and hiding tape recorders. While there are several hours of audio recordings of ""Bill,"" there are only a few seconds of film where we can see Janet speaking in his voice. The movie doesn't ignore this skepticism. In"

As she confronts her 11-year-old daughter, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) is the very picture of exasperation, her shoulders simultaneously squared and stooped, her face weary and determined. Surrounded by the dreary, cracked walls of their North London council flat, young Janet (Madison Wolfe) looks up at her mother, at once defiant and afraid. ""I'm not lying,"" she insists. Peggy doesn't believe her. The headmistress has called, she tells Janet, and reported that she caught Janet with a cigarette in hand. But you do believe Janet, because you've seen the events at school that the headmistress misunderstood. You also know, because you're watching a movie called The Conjuring 2, that as soon as Janet and her older sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito) pull out a spirit board to ask whether anyone might want to contact them, that they will be contacted and moreover, that adults in the vicinity will continue to misunderstand events. You know too, that Janet, so earnest and so distressed that her mother won't believe her, will be the visiting spirits' primary target, soon enough speaking in a scary man's voice, turning increasingly pale, and twisting her limbs into impossible positions. As this target, Janet is pretty perfect and utterly familiar. Based on a 1977 case that involved the Warrens, real life evangelical ghost hunters who became popular following their work on the Amityville horror, and souvenir collectors, The Conjuring 2 at first cuts back and forth between the haunted flat in Enfield and Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), back in Connecticut. Though they've already appeared in The Conjuring, the film reintroduces them here, in Amityville, engaged in the very case that made them famous. However you know Amityville, through the books or the many films and TV iterations, including the 1979 movie with James Brolin and the the 2005 movie with Ryan Reynolds, you know it. That is to say, you know the DeFeos met a bad end when they didn't leave their sinister house in New York. Here you see that end again, as Lorraine, clairvoyant, channels the killer and walks room to room, cocking and firing an invisible shotgun at family members in their beds. (She also sees a ""Demon Nun"" [Bonnie Aarons], whose reappearance throughout the film implies Lorraine has her own special haranguer, not tied to a place.) The DeFeo business an undeniably chilling evocation: when Lorraine passes a mirror, you see the bearded Butch DeFeo, the two figures locked in a wholly ghastly version of the Harpo-Groucho Marx mirror gag. Lorraine's performance here serves as a mirror for you as well, as she watches herself, appalled and abject, consumed by the image. By the time she finds herself back at the table downstairs, next to Ed and dissolved in tears, you're well aware that this work they're doing, the part that you do with them, which is to witness monstrosity, has costs.

Jack Harper Oblivion is a visually stunning film. It's what I've come to expect with the latest sci-fi films. Director Joseph Kosinski continues to bring his strong visual principles from Tron Legacy (a film which I'm a massive fan of) into Oblivion, where Earth is presented as a desolate planet, destroyed by an alien invasion. While familiar world landmarks (e.g. the Empire State Building in New York) are buried/destroyed, it is beautifully contrasted with vehicles and home station towers which are designed to live and travel comfortably whilst preserving security and maintenance that our hero, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) has to undertake. Notice how the towers and Jack's mode of transport, the bubble ship, are mainly see-through. It suggests to the audience that this clean, modern and futuristic way of living has nothing to hide while it subconsciously suggests a false sense of security and that everything is not all it seems. It's either that or an IKEA designer survived the alien war and business is booming! Joking aside, despite the very epic and strong visuals, I did found this film lacking. The problem I have with Oblivion has nothing to do with Tom Cruise (who I thought was superb) or the rest of the cast who deliver strong and heartfelt performances. The problem sadly lies with the plot. It felt slightly backwards. The first 2/3 of the film sets up the plot nicely. It easily establishes how we find Earth in the aftermath of the invasion. It's introduces the character of Jack Harper as we see his mind constantly battle between two conflicts. The first conflict is his honourable duty to his partner, Victoria (played by Andrea Riseborough) and the mission. Maintain control, fix drones and they get to go home. The second conflict is the dreams he has of another past life and most importantly, another woman. Who was this woman who haunted his dreams and why does he seem to be the only one affected by it? It shouldn't be possible as both Jack and Victoria both had a security memory wipe, which is suppose to keep their memories hidden beneath the surface so they could only focus on the objective. The confliction is handled very well. After everything that has happened to Earth, Jack still regards it as home, and to be honest who would blame him. He doesn't want to leave. He fondly remembers the last Super Bowl game in the same way we would remember the last music concert or the first football game you went to. He hoards collectable items such as old records, books and toys and takes them off grid to a secret location  a cabin that doubles up as a personal museum. It's his heaven, his fortress of solitude where objectives and missions are secondary and Earth's beauty and colour becomes primary. His partner, Victoria doesn't share the same feelings, obviously"
132,FPY_Doc2_Oblivion,FPY_Doc2_Oblivion,FPY,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"In the opening sequence of Oblivion, the voice of Tom Cruise (playing the film's protagonist, Commander Jack Harper) creeps onto the soundtrack and painstakingly explains the precise details of the film's backstory. The year is 2077. The Earth is all but abandoned. An alien population known as Scavengers (Scavs for short) invaded the moon, which in turn nearly destroyed the earth. Most humans have moved to a space station. Drones and technicians like Harper roam the earth, and so on and son on. A metric ton of exposition is slammed into that opening sequence, but here's what's peculiar: at the beginning of the second act, after Jack discovers a hibernating astronaut (Olga Kurylekno) and saves her, he sits her down and gives her the whole spiel again. Why? Is this a safeguard in case people showed up late? Do they think we didn't get it the first time? I have a theory. As Cruise was explaining the whole movie again, my mind started to wander. (It had nothing better to do.) I found myself re-imagining the film, up to that point, without the Tom Cruise Explains It All voice-over  merely images of a ravished earth, followed by the jargon-heavy first act, establishing his work and daily routine. And guess what: in that one tiny alteration, the movie I made in my head was far superior to the one I was watching. Had we not been provided with that painfully labored exposition, had we been trusted to figure that info out for ourselves, or let it reveal itself organically (like when, say, he had to explain it to the astronaut), Oblivion could have been... well, it still wouldn't have been a great movie. But it would have been a far more interesting one. And I found myself wondering if co-writer/director Joseph Kosinski had put that voice-over in originally, or if it was the result of prodding by the suits, a la Blade Runner. But that's the trouble with mainstream science fiction filmmaking these days: there's no expectation that an audience is capable of putting things together or waiting for a payoff, and there certainly aren't many filmmakers or executives willing to take the risk. The problem, it seems, is the desire of those who greenlight movies to lump science fiction in with action, and it's easy to guess why: Star Wars. Before 1977, there were occasional crossovers, but for the most part, science fiction was a genre purely unto itself, concerned with alien invasions and post-apocalyptic scenarios and subtextual parallels. After Lucas mashed up spaceships and swashbucklers, sci-fi was never the same. This is not to say that there haven't been great sci-fi/action movies: the original Star Wars trilogy, of course, and the first two Terminators, and Aliens, and the first Matrix. But those films worked, to some extent, in spite of themselves  because the fundamental purposes of great science fiction and great action are so diametrically opposed. Great science fiction is brainy and smart, fueled by Big Concepts"

This is also the precise sentiment created by his previous film, Tron: Legacy. Though the Tom Cruise-starring science fiction adventure is breathtaking to look at, there is nothing to the film aside from the visuals. Bland, predictable, and frankly boring, Oblivion is an empty stylistic exercise, and feels like a slick bit of advertising, not a movie. Filmed in IMAX with Sony's new CineAlta F65 camera, Oblivion does look fantastic. Watching drone repairman Jack Harper (Cruise) blast through the wrecked-up wasteland of a post-alien invasion New York City on a futuristic dirt bike, past the strewn carcasses of container ships and submarines, is spectacular. Or when he floats through the ruined world in his bubble ship, the special effects are crisp and clean, and blend seamlessly with the frame. They're so good you don't notice them. But the entire film reminds you of those IMAX movies you saw as a kid, where a helicopter mounted camera sweeps around the rim of an active volcano, or dives into the Grand Canyon. The biggest problem in Oblivion is that it has about as much story, character, and emotional involvement as those clinical, removed IMAX movies. Jack and his partnerin both a business and romantic senseVictoria (Andrea Riseborough), are two of the last human beings on the planet. As Jack's heavy-handed voice over tells you at the outset, and as the film explains in great detail again and again throughout, aliens called Scavs destroyed our moon, which threw the planet into geologic upheaval. When chaos was in full bloom, they invaded, and we were forced to use nukes to win the day. So we won the war, but the planet was ruined in the process, and the human race relocated to Jupiter's moon of Titan. All that remains are skeleton crews like Jack and Victoria, tasked with servicing the droneswhich make sounds like a synthesizer fartingthat protect the massive rigs that drain seawater to convert into power for the folks on Titan. The whole set up is an obvious attempt to make you consider our own dependence on finite natural resources like oilthe docks are set up to look like offshore oil drilling platformsbut other than a quick mention that the oceans are almost gone, the metaphor is roundly ignored. Jack and Victoria are stock movie short timers. With just two weeks left before their mission is complete and the can move on to Titan, she just wants to keep her head down, do her job, swim naked with Jack, and abandon this place to memory. He, on the other hand, is wistful, questioning, and still feels that Earth, even after everything, is still his home. You're supposed to feel his yearning when, standing in the middle of the ruins of a football stadium, he waxes poetic about a game he has never seen, but there is so little emotional connection that you can't"
134,FPY_Doc4_Oblivion,FPY_Doc4_Oblivion,FPY,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"The boisterous space-aged yarn 'Oblivion' is a post-apocalyptic popcorn pleaser that may be met with mixed reception depending on your definition of tolerance for rousing, recycled sci-fi cinema. On one hand, the positive outlook is that 'Oblivion' boasts what moviegoers routinely expect from a typical Tom Cruise vehicle  a flashy actioner with hotshot Tom Terrific pushing the excitable buttons in what amounts to be revved-up flick dipped in radiant shades of vibrancy. Naturally, Cruise is no stranger to the genre of fantasy-filled flamboyant escapism where saving the world from ruination is top priority. As for the less-than-positive vibes that blemish 'Oblivion', the sentiment is such that the futuristic Cruise-control caper never quite captures an imaginative or distinctive tone while running on the straight-forward fumes of other borrowed concepts from current and nostalgic sci-fi fare. Instead of soaking in the whimsical wonderment of 'Oblivion's surrealistic scope one finds the need to recognise how much the carbon copy material undermines what could have been an intriguing action-adventure with its own sense of style, substance and sensuality. Although opulent, ambitious and populated with fine performers that try to breathe some creative life into the sporadic script, 'Oblivion' is stiff thematically and fails to deliver a premium-plus pulse of twitchy intrigue and surging suspense. Theoretically, 'Oblivion' has all the top-notch zip of a 'Battlestar Galactica' TV re-run from the early 80s. Director Joseph Kosinski ('Tron: Legacy') and screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt revisit familiar territory here and particularly do not have anything original, impish or introspective to offer beyond the confines of a mechanical sci-fi fable that marches to the beat of other cinematic influences. Shamelessly, 'Oblivio'n taps into such reminiscences of 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix', 'Total Recall', 'The Book Of Eli' and 'Phantasm' (and even Cruise's signature free-wheeling classic 'Top Gun') that one is left wondering why Kosinski's Xerox-coated narrative did not dip into other possible targets for consideration. Cruise plays Jack Harper, a drone-servicing technician whose responsibilities entail that his profession is to ensure the safety of a post-nuclear Earth by preventing the invasion of alien scavengers (or 'scavs' as referred to in the movie). It is the year 2077 and Harper works diligently with his pretty partner Vicca (Andrea Riseborough, 'Welcome To The Punch'). Sixty years ago in 2017, the planet was riddled with war-torn activity and never quite recovered from the planetary destruction. So Harper and Vicca are the only Earth-bound humans as their fellow citizens are residing on the moon Saturn securing their existences there and yes...both Jack and Vicca find some amorous time for some intimate pillow talk. Harper and Vicca answer to their rigid superior Sally (Oscar-winner Melissa Leo), the commander of the space station where her orders are issued. The important factor to consider is that both Harper and Vicca (and countless others for that matter) have had their memories erased completely. The chronic memory losses  at the hands of the nefarious government officials  and the continual maintenance of the heavily armed"

Kosinski has a flair for stunning imagery and an ear for epic, sweeping, and catchy scores. The less one thinks about his films, the better. Set in 2077, in the years following an alien attack on Earth, Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as a technician named Jack who spends his days repairing drones that guard a series of nuclear reactors dedicated to converting the planet's oceans into fuel for a terraforming expedition to Titan, one of Saturn's moons. The drones are in place to kill ""Scavs,"" remnant forces of the alien expedition who were defeated after the Earth's nuclear powers unleashed their weapons on the invaders. Radiation has poisoned the land. Earth's cities lay in ruins after aliens destroyed the moon, unleashing earthquakes and tsunamis on the planet below. Colonizing Titan is humanity's last hope. Jack's memories have been wiped by his superiorswho live on the Tet, a huge spaceship that will transport humanity's remnants to Titanfor reasons that are never made entirely clear to Jack or to the audience. Some of those memories haunt Jack's dreams, however, causing tension with his coworker, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). Jack knows something is wrong, but he can't quite figure out what. He frequently retreats to a cabin in the woods that is invisible to the Tet and to Victoria, and listens to Led Zeppelin LPs and shoots hoops. He reads of Super Bowl games played in the distant past, imagining what it would have been like to live back then. Nevertheless, he remains content to do the work he is assigneduntil an encounter with the Scavs leaves him questioning everything. I'm being as vague as possible to avoid spoiling any of the twists and turns for those of you who want to see this entertaining movie. It is worth noting, however, that the whole is much less than its parts. Should one spend a few moments actually thinking about Oblivion's various conundrums and plot points, one quickly will realize Oblivion is an illogical mess which annoyingly abuses the audience's willing suspension of disbelief. With Kosinski's Tron: Legacy, there was some excuse for the aimlessness, dead-end plot points, and illogical focus on the wrong issues: four different screenwriters are credited in that film, and who-knows-how-many executives meddled with what Disney hoped would turn into a tent pole franchise. Oblivion, though, is straight from Kosinski's imagination. He developed the idea before beginning work on Tron; saw it sidetracked during the writer's strike; and resurrected it as a graphic novel (which was never released). Kosinski's deep personal connection to the project makes Oblivion's derivative nature all the more frustrating. Plot points, images, and themes are cobbled together from a raft of sci-fi films including The Matrix, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Wall-E, and Planet of the Apes, among others. Complaints about plausibility, logic, or common sense aside, the film looks great. Kosinski has an obvious flair for set design"
136,FPY_Doc6_Oblivion,FPY_Doc6_Oblivion,FPY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"For Oblivion, the second feature by Joseph Kosinski, the director uses the same two-parts-style-and-one-part-substance recipe as in his previous feature, TRON: Legacy, but this time the concoction goes down easier. Based on Kosinski's own unpublished graphic novel and written by screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt, this gorgeous production seems more concerned with producing remarkable images than telling a remarkable story. But what images. Kosinski combines top-notch special FX with the same primordial, Icelandic scenery that Ridley Scott used for his comparable visualist's rendering of Prometheus, and the result is a familiar post-apocalyptic alien invasion tale ripped from the pages of countless (and better) science-fiction stories. Fortunately, the original material has no expectations to meet, unlike Scott's did, leaving the serviceablebut nothing more than thatstory to maintain our interest as the director's awe-inspiring visuals, exciting action sequences, and the ever-watchable star power of Tom Cruise keep the audience rapt. Cruise stars as Jack Harper, a white-clad technician on Earth some 64 years after humanity's devastating battle with invaders from outer space, who first attacked by detonating our Moon. The Earth was rocked with resultant natural disasters and soon irradiated by human nukes in retaliation, the landscape left almost unlivable. Survivors decided to migrate to Saturn's habitable moon, Titan, and now leftover is a massive upside-down pyramid-shaped station called the Tet, which orbits the planet. Below on the surface, enormous engines collect water for Titan, and Harper repairs downed equipment and his team's security drones on missions monitored by the other sole member of his so-called ""mop-up crew"", his controller Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), with whom he shares a bed. Their orders come from a Tet ""mission control"" agent (Melissa Leo) who asks daily, ""Are you an effective team?""leaving us to ponder what happens when the answer is no. That moment comes in due time when Jack finds himself asking questions about his five-year mission, such as why a mandatory ""memory wipe"" was required. Or, why the few surviving alien Scavengers (called Scavs) are trying to trap him? The audience asks their own questions too, like why are Victoria's pupils always dilated? And then there are Jack's visionsthose vague impressions he gets at night of a woman he has perhaps never seen. What do they mean, and how do they relate to the now-dead prewar world to which Jack feels so close to yet could have never known? His digging puts a strain on his and Victoria's strict mission orders to keep within their designated borders and protect the vital water collectors, all targets for the lingering Scavs inside the perimeter, where beyond is a deadly ""Radiation Zone."" Victoria's conformity and insistent lack of curiosity remain unbending, while Jack's romanticism keeps him going. And when a prewar shuttle containing five cryogenically frozen humans crash lands and is attacked by drones, Jack must also ask why drones would attack humans and why the sole survivor, Julia (Olga Kurylenko), looks exactly like the woman from his dreams. Her presence in the Jack-Victoria relationship becomes"

But those things are in the past and as wacky as they were they still didn't effect the level of his onscreen work. He's a talented actor who throughout his career has tackled a wide variety of roles in iconic 80's cheesefests, stirring and emotional dramas, big budgeted franchises, and even sci-fi thrillers. Now he returns to the science fiction genre in ""Oblivion"", a much more direct and vast sci-fi picture than Cruise's other efforts. ""Oblivion"" is co-written and directed by Joseph Kosinski, the man behind Disney's $400 million money maker ""Tron: Legacy"". Disney originally purchased the rights to ""Oblivion"" in hopes of repeating Tron's success but later relinquished the rights. It was quickly gobbled up by Universal Studios with Tom Cruise and Jessica Chastain set to star in the picture. Chastain would eventually drop out for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" with Olga Kurylenko replacing her. The movie is based on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel and was given an ambitious $120 million budget. I have to say I was really excited for ""Oblivion""even though the studio was very cryptic in regards to the film's details. That's a good approach to take because I found that the less you know going in the more effective the story will be. And for me it was quite effective. ""Oblivion"" doesn't fall into the category of a science fiction masterpiece but thanks to its visionary conception, stunning effects, and some strong committed performances it doesn't miss by much. Now there have been three main criticisms hurled at ""Oblivion"". Some have complained about its thin plot. Others took off points for its lack of originality. And yet others have had problems with the lack of any meaningful character development. I certainly don't flippantly dismiss any of these gripes but I don't necessarily agree with them either. There's a lot going on in ""Oblivion"" and while it does borrow from several other sci-fi pictures, the same could be said for most science fiction. As for the lack of character development, that may be true but I found there to be a good and needed reason for it. Like I said the less you know the better so I'm not going to spoil anything by divulging any significant details. The film is set in 2077 during the aftermath of a war with an alien species known as the Scavengers. The Scavs (as they're affectionally called) destroyed our moon which sent Earth into a series of natural and environmental convulsions. A full invasion of Earth followed. The humans won the war but the planet was left ravaged and in disrepair. The surviving population now inhabit one of Saturn's moons called Titan. Now if a sci-fi movie wants to score points with me just give me a futuristic world that's not only visually impressive but that I can get lost in. That certainly happened here and even if"

Every genre has a big hit here and a big hit there every year, but, every now and then, a single year will have multiple watershed films that transcend and extend the genre. In the realm of science fiction, the years of 1968 (2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes), 1977 (Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars), and 1997 (Gattaca, Contact, The Fifth Element, Men in Black, and Starship Troopers) really stand out historically as years were multiple films made a significant impact to the genre and not just the box office. Time will tell, but we may have just had one go by in 2011 (Source Code, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Another Earth, Melancholia, Paul, Real Steel, X-Men: First Class, and, to a lesser degree, Transformers: Dark of the Moon). In this critics opinion, the very best year for science fiction in film history was easily 1982, boasting E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Blade Runner, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Tron, and The Thing. All have gone on to be considered classics, groundbreakers, and trendsetters in their own right. Once we finish 2013, there's a good chance this year might join that group and maybe even rival 1982. The ambitious (on paper anyways) science fiction slate coming in 2013 includes Star Trek Into Darkness, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Vin Diesel returning to Riddick, Will Smith and Jaden Smith in After Earth, the March flop The Host, the indie flickUpside Down, Neill Blomkamp's District 9 follow-up Elysium, Alfonso Cuaran's Children of Men follow-up Gravity, the summer slugfest Pacific Rim, the zombie blockbuster World War Z, and the hotly anticipated novel adaptations of Ender's Game and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. ""Loaded"" is an understatement and one more of those headliners is out this weekend. The first really legitimate film that gets this year of science fiction started is Oblivion. From the producers of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Joseph Kosinski, the kinetic director of Tron: Legacy (a movie I loved), Tom Cruise returns to science fiction for the first time in eight years since 2005's Spielberg juggernaut War of the Worlds. Oblivion, against recent trend, actually moved its release date earlier from a summer release this July to late April, while some of its peers like Jack the Giant Slayer and G.I. Joe: Retribution experienced nearly year-long delays to be here in the spring of 2013. Filled with amazing post-apocalyptic spectacle, dazzling action sequences, and a heady story of twists and turns, the challenge of Oblivion is whether or not you, as the audience, can allow the strong visuals to make up for the weak narrative. This film will not go down as a 1982-level classic and borrows too many elements from other movies including The Matrix, Planet of the Apes, WALL-E, Tarkovsky and Soderbergh's takes on Solaris, Duncan Jones's under-seen Moon, and even a"
139,FPY_Doc9_Oblivion,FPY_Doc9_Oblivion,FPY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"""Oblivion"" is a competently made sci-fi action movie  something that can't be said about the majority of the genre. Though many of the prominent futurism themes can be linked back to earlier films, and a few loose ends might not be tied up with the sturdiest of knots, the structure and plot twists keep the intrigue high while the action paces itself nicely alongside the unfolding mystery. Tom Cruise makes a compelling hero and the setup is a savvy blend of dystopian invention and amnesia-induced identity loss. The list of films ""Oblivion"" borrows from is a long one, but the concepts are all executed cleverly and proficiently, resulting in an epic space opus that presents far more moments of awe than head-scratching queries. The year is 2077 and Earth has been left nearly uninhabitable after a brutal war against an invading alien species known as ""Scavengers."" While the remnants of humanity have been gathered aboard the Tet, an enormous pyramidal space station that will eventually carry the survivors to a new home on one of Saturn's moons, technician Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain on Earth to monitor and perform maintenance on giant hydro-rigs and the protective, heavily armed robot drones that guard them. When a spaceship crash-lands nearby and Jack investigates, he rescues from the wreckage Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a mysterious woman whose appearance sets into motion the discovery of a massive conspiracy that will place the very fate of mankind in Jack's hands. ""Oblivion"" is heady, weighty, and cerebral science-fiction, foregoing the little green man angle for a much more sinister and complex alien incursion. In terms of postapocalyptic, futuristic thrillers, borrowing randomly from ""The Road Warrior,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Moon,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Total Recall,"" it's a highly ambitious and largely successful twist, toying with existential and deterministic viewpoints while smartly avoiding depressing bouts of violence or sacrifice. Its focus on altering or interfering with memories is augmented perfectly by the heavily synthesized soundtrack, itself lending to the dreamlike qualities of Jack's remembrances. An engaging mystery, ""Oblivion"" forces viewers to wait nearly two hours before giving up any secrets; but to the film's credit, the protracted anticipation is delightful. Mind-boggling and artistically visionary, the many answers it finally grapples with will probably raise further investigations into the various aspects less examined, but the climactic conclusion is pleasantly resolute  even if specific details can be rationalized with the term ""gaping plot holes."" An exemplary fit for IMAX screens, ""Oblivion"" boasts outstanding visuals that add tremendously to the scope of the project. Immense exterior shots and sets introduce the audience to a uniquely fascinating world, with unfriendly terrain, monumental wreckage, and obscured paradises. The interior designs are just as spectacular, though used much more sparingly. The obvious budget for special effects definitely helps establish and stabilize the pioneering perspective; visual wizardry occasionally substitutes for inchoate plot points. But perhaps most impressive of all is the origins of the story, starting as"
140,FPY_Doc10_Oblivion,FPY_Doc10_Oblivion,FPY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"It's not often that I find myself recommending that a film be seen in IMAX, but the simple truth is that's about the only way to see Oblivion to really get anything out of the otherwise formulaic and meandering film. Based upon an unpublished graphic novella by the director, Oblivion has Tom Cruise as one of the few remaining drone repairmen assigned to Earth. The Earth's surface has been left in devastation after a war with the alien Scavs, but on one of his missions back to Earth Cruise's Jack Harper discovers a crashed spacecraft that calls into question everything he's ever believed about the war and may even put the fate of mankind into his hands. Oh, that's all. Oblivion isn't a particularly interesting film. It's sort of stuck between being an action/thriller and an intelligent sci-fi flick, but it never really makes its way far enough into the action to truly please fans of high adventure sci-fi nor will it truly satisfy those who like to analyze and over-analyze the meaning behind the meaning of their science fiction films. This is never a bad film, but it also never really rises above its mediocrity with the definite exception of being a truly beautiful film to watch that makes good use of its special effects and reveals the potential that Cruise likely saw when he signed on for the project. Director Joseph Kosinski also directed Tron: Legacy, and it's pretty apparent that Kosinski has learned a thing or two since that film. He still hasn't mastered the art of telling a cohesive and fully developed story, a lacking that becomes ever more significant as the film winds down just past the two-hour mark. I enjoyed the initial story in Oblivion quite a bit more than that in Tron: Legacy, though this film goes on a good 20 minutes or so too long and loses its consistency of tone far too frequently throughout its running time. That said, it's a more defined story structure that at least gets our interest even if it doesn't manage to quite hold onto it. The best thing about the film may very well be its magnificent original score from the French electronic band M83, a score that does everything a really good score is supposed to do in serving as companion to the film and facilitating its journey without dominating it. The most unusual thing about Oblivion, on the other hand, may very well be that Tom Cruise is surprisingly irrelevant within the context of the film with co-star Andrea Riseborough really enjoying most of the film's emotionally resonant and visually satisfying journeys. The film's first half, which largely focuses on Cruise and Riseborough, is easily its most satisfying. It's not Olga Kurylenko's fault that the film really spirals downward when she arrives on the scene contained within a crashed spacecraft, but more the fault of a story that goes from haunting and hypnotic to melodramatic and meandering.

After discovering a ""planet killer"" comet on a collision course with Earth, two scientists are frustrated to be met with ambivalence by politicians, media and the general public. McKay deserves credit for not only assembling a cast full of more stars than our galaxy but also bringing Jennifer Lawrence back into the acting orbit. After some over-exposure and burnout, she returns with a renewed energy and is the perfect vitriolic foil to Leonardo DiCaprio's paranoid Dr. Mindy. Ever since he finally won his Oscar in 2014, DiCaprio has been flexing acting muscles previously unknown to the public. Not only does he play against type by having an affair with a woman his own age, but following his meme-inspiring turn in Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood, he successfully tries his hand at comedy. His character goes on a Dark Knight-esque ""you either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"" arc before getting a pitch-perfect The Social Network-style rant  one even angrier than Mark Kermode's opinion of Jared Leto's performance in House Of Gucci. Elsewhere, it is no surprise to anyone that actors like Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett and Mark Rylance nail their roles respectively. Related: Of Tenets and Terminators  How to end the world A film about the end of the world reminds us, if anything, that time is precious. With that in mind, any film with a runtime of 145 minutes needs to justify it. Does Don't Look Up? No, it does not. Similar to the failed plan to split the comet into smaller, less dangerous pieces, the issue is that instead of focusing on one particular target, McKay takes aim at too many. There is criticism of the government, the media, news corporations, conspiracy theorists, vacuous pop stars, etc, etc. The results are more misfires than direct hits. It is fascinating to watch this film in context with other Hollywood movies about the end of the world. Think back to the mid-to-late Nineties. Films like Armageddon and Independence Day, where the world pulled together to fight for survival. Presidents would get in a plane and join the fight. Even in something like Air Force One, while not facing a planetary threat, showed the President as a hero. Fast forward to 2021. Five years on from the year of Trump and Brexit and it is not difficult to see a shift in how governments and world leaders are presented on film. No longer figures of hope and inspiration, they are instead the punchline for a bad joke. While the world is holding out for a hero, Don't Look Up is simply a cautionary tale. Despite some clever gags (there is a terrific running joke about the cost of snacks at the White"

So, does that mean I'm a true genius based on the fact that I'm calling Adam McKay's savage American political satire his best film ever? That's because Don't Look Up is unlike any satire you've ever seen. Well, except the ones that seemed like a satire on CNN and Fox News the past five years. That's because most have decided to learn to stop worrying and love the bomb,hite House, , just plain chaos. You can have your Ron Burgundys, Michael Burrys, Jared Vennetts, Champ Kinds, and Brick Tamlands (well, maybe not Brick), I'll take your Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonard Dicaprio), and Ph.D. student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) who discovered a deadly comet hurtling towards earth, the film's political leaders, President Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her son/Chief of Staff Jason Orlean (Jonah Hill), and government scientist Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), who had an intimate moment with Sting that is more horrifying than anything coming down from the heavens. It all sounds absurd. It's not like we have faced the worst global pandemic that has put the world in danger over the past twenty months. It's not like the oval office put off production of masks so they could hand that off to big business to spend tax dollars at an overrated premium. Or the fact that the country became so split to the far right and left, they practically met back up in the middle? That is where Mark Rylance's Peter Isherwell, over the tech and social media platform company BASH, comes in. He wants to monetize somehow the McGuffin that keeps racing towards the earth and is going to end the human race. Hey, whoever said capitalism has its limits? There are so many great performances, subplots, and bits that go into Don't Look Up that I cannot describe them all here. Dicaprio might have given his funniest and most unhinged performance as a scientist who can't seem to get the decision-makers or media members to see just how serious this situation is. I could not get enough of Jonah Hill's take on a spoiled, unimpressive son of the President who was handed his position of Chief Staff (not to mention the joke of the head of NASA whose resume consists of being an Anosteglogist). Even a running gag of General Themes (played by veteran actor Paul Guilfoyle) charging money for free snacks, to begin with, sums up government spending perfectly. Many may question that point of that scene, and with good reason. But what makes it so funny and different is because it has never been done before. It's all conjured up in a way that's entertaining and genuinely terrifying because, even if satirical, the fact is the situation is still fresh and current. I have a feeling many may find the humor too much of a comic sketch. For those who"
143,FZC_Doc3_Don't_Look_Up,FZC_Doc3_Don't_Look_Up,FZC,Comedy,Positive,Don't_Look_Up,"Don't Look Up calls out institutional indifference to impending disaster with relatable and riveting rage thanks to a scorching script and engaged ensemble. It's quite fascinating to look back at Adam McKay's filmography so far. After getting his start in film with the hit TV news satire Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  following a six-year stint as a writer on Saturday Night Live  he mostly made comedies for much of the 2000s and 2010s, almost all of which (Talladega Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobby, Step Brothers, The Other Guys) were staggeringly commercially successful. However, in 2015, despite all the raves he had received as one of our most reliable comedy filmmakers, McKay took the risk to pave a new path for himself in Hollywood with the biographical dramedy The Big Short, playing on his formerly private political passions by revisiting the financial crisis of 2007-2008 to call out those responsible for the U.S. housing bubble that triggered that tragedy. Still, McKay retained much of his signature sardonic style and withering wit, enlivening what could've been boring and blase biopic with whip-smart writing and energetic editing. And for his endlessly praised efforts, he eventually received the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, prompting McKay to continue with this career progression, premiering the equally piercing Vice just three years later, in which he took former Vice President Dick Cheney to task for his contributions to the decay of the social climate of our country and acquired even more accolades in the process. Now, with Don't Look Up, McKay has sought to synthesize his two approaches to storytelling  sidesplitting social satire and acerbic political analysis  with a fictional fable that nevertheless has very real roots in the turmoil of today. When two low-level astronomers, Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio, of Titanicand Inception) and grad student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence, of The Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook), discover that a meteor will strike the Earth in sixth months, they immediately try and warn the wretchedly prideful president Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep, of Mamma Mia and The Devil Wears Prada), but after being rebuffed by her and her snide son Jason (Jonah Hill, of Superbad and The Wolf of Wall Street) and not taken seriously, they're forced to take alternative methods to make their message known, embarking on a media tour to warn the world of this impending disaster before it's too late. Sadly, in addition to squabbling with our egoistical executives, Mindy and Dibiasky face a contemptuous citizenry that doesn't want to accept the alarming words of these astronomers, resulting in a race against time to change their minds before the meteor makes impact and annihilates all human life as we know it. First and foremost, the success of Don't Look Up lies in a factor that was actually outside of McKay's control  its terrifying timeliness. Initially constructed as a metaphor for climate change (after a conversation McKay had with political journalist David Sirota where the latter"
144,FZC_Doc4_Don't_Look_Up,FZC_Doc4_Don't_Look_Up,FZC,Comedy,Positive,Don't_Look_Up,"Adam McKay's entertainingly broad-side-of-the-barn satire Don't Look Up may be exactly the film we deserve in the post-Trump Presidency wasteland of COVID infections, science denialism, QAnon conspiracies, and locked-horns political turmoil. The raging political and cultural battles shaped by masses of people willing to turn a blind eye to demonstrable facts in favor of self-righteous ideological fantasy may very well be the defining quagmire of the current era, and McKay and co-writer David Sirota are clearly swinging for the fences in trying to capture it and bottle it as both cinematic entertainment and socio-political finger-wagging. It works both ways, but not always very well. The gist of the story is that a huge comet is hurtling toward Earth, and when it hits in six months, it will be a ""planet killer,"" meaning that its impact will extinguish virtually all life on the planet. The comet is first discovered by Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), a punkish graduate student under the mentorship of straight-laced astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) at Michigan State University. At first, they are elated to have discovered a new celestial body, but when they do the calculations and arrive at the only possibly conclusion, dread sets in. They try to sound the alarm, first by contacting and allying with Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), the head of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (which, humorously, no seems to know exists). They take their findings to President Orlean (Meryl Streep), but quickly learn that she and her team, headed by her nepotistic son and Chief of Staff Jason (Jonah Hill), are too busy with their own political headaches to care. Undeterred, Randall and Kate take to the airwaves, where they find themselves on a chatty morning show hosted by the perennially smiling Jack Bremmer (Tyler Perry) and Brie Evantee (Cate Blanchett), who can't be bothered to break their show's chipper tone even when Kate literally loses it on air warning everyone of their eminent demise (which, of course, is immediately absorbed by meme culture). At this point, Don't Look Up feels like a COVID allegory, positing a more extreme version of the scenario in which we are faced with a grave situation but can't shrug ourselves out of our complacency to do anything about it (people are more interested in Ariana Grande's fictional pop star and her high publicized romantic woes than the impending demise of humanity). However, once President Orlean finds herself in a particularly nasty political situation involving her disastrous Supreme Court nominee, she suddenly becomes interested in finding a way to stop the comet, thus shifting the film into Wag the Dog territory. But, wait, there's more, because a tech guru-billionaire named Peter Isherwell (Mark Rylance, doing an weirder and more ominous riff on Ready Player One's James Halliday) discovers that the comet is filled with valuable minerals, and he colludes with President Orlean to try to exploit it, rather than stop it.

145,FZC_Doc5_Don't_Look_Up,FZC_Doc5_Don't_Look_Up,FZC,Comedy,Positive,Don't_Look_Up,"few years ago, in 2015, filmmaker Adam McKay released a movie called The Big Short, about the unsexy math nerds who predicted, in the early 2000s, the collapse of collateralized-debt-obligations ""market"" that caused the 2008 financial crisis. The movie focuses in part on their frustrations in being ignored, in some cases actively treated as literally insane, for trying to point out the huge problems with our economy and the crash that was inevitably coming, and soon. It's a funny film! But also an enraging one. Inherent in the satire McKay (Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, The Other Guys) deploys is an exasperation with a media-driven reality of our culture: that, to quote my review of the movie, ""much of what led to 2008... was happening right in front of our faces, but we were too distracted by celebrity gossip and the new iPhones to even notice."" The ""arcane shenanigans of high finance"" simply were not amusing enough to penetrate our collective awareness, even when they were fomenting an enormous disaster. Even when that disaster might have been avoided if only we could have been induced to pay attention. But The Big Short came too late for anyone to do anything to stop a cave-in of the global economy. It came years after no one listened to those guys and the damage was done. What if  one can almost hear McKay thinking with Don't Look Up  we had a movie about experts screaming about another looming disaster, one that will be much worse that collateralized debt obligations, yet one it's not too late to address? Directer and cowriter (with David Sirota, a journalist making his feature-film debut) McKay has practically remade The Big Short here, except it's about global warming. (This film was conceived before the pandemic but it could easily be about COVID, too, which kinda cements the overarching case it presents.) But Don't Look Up is even more blunt and more broad than Short was. Don't Look Up is as subtle as a sledgehammer. Inherent in its premise seems to be that it has no choice but to be outrageous, because it's the only way we'll listen. It cannot afford to be subtle, because subtle doesn't work, and the stakes are just too high. And so we have two ordinary astronomers from an unfancy public university, Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio: The Revenant, The Wolf of Wall Street), and his student, PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence: X-Men: Dark Phoenix, Red Sparrow), trying to convince the world that the comet she has just discovered will absolutely, positively smash into planet Earth in six months. It's twice as big as the space rock that eliminated the dinosaurs, so, yeah, this is a problem. The situation is not totally hopeless, because there are mitigations that can be attempted, according to Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan: Greyhound, The Photograph), head of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (which is, the movie pauses to explain, ""a real place""). Small problem: no one"

They say it's too dark. It's too depressing. Haters are moaning that writer-director Adam McKay repeatedly hits his audience over the head with his ""the planet is dying"" message. Uh, yeah, he isand amen to that. This is the truest, most on-point movie I saw in 2021. McKay gets sinister in Don't Look Up, and I, for one, am glad somebody is being appropriately nasty in pointing out how absolutely moronic humans have become in the new millennium. Sorry, folks: We are fucking up big time; McKay knows it; and he's pulling no punches. This is the darkest of dark comedies, and it covers many topics, including the continued decimation of our planet, our over-reliance on tech, our soul-killing obsession with social media, and the crazy space-race programs created by billionaire men. McKay's brutal satire takes no prisoners, eviscerates political extremists and lemmings, and basically says we are all fucked if we continue on this current coursewith or without an apocalyptic comet hurtling toward Earth. The fictional comet in Don't Look Up is on a direct path to hit Earth in six months, discovered by a college student (Jennifer Lawrence) and her professor (Leonardo DiCaprio), and verified by the head of planetary defense (Rob Morgan). With all of their data, pictures and science, an egomaniac president (Meryl Streep) is far too preoccupied by her latest Supreme Court nominee's troublesome background and upcoming midterms to be concerned about the end of the world. This isn't just satire; this is practically a documentary. The comet symbolizes many things going wrong in the world right now, including Trumpism, COVID-19, global warming and tech obsession. Yes, the film is a bit heavy-handed, but necessary. The supporting cast includes Mark Rylance as a hilarious hybrid of the tech billionaires running the planet, Jonah Hill as the president's son and chief of staff, and Ron Perlman as a commander pilot with a bad social filter. DiCaprio is his typical genius self, playing against type as a nebbish nerd who suddenly has a spotlight shining on him. He grabs the opportunity and mines it for many laughs. Lawrence is equally funny as the downbeat comet-discoverer who can't believe the ignorance she is beholding. Morgan is droll yet hilarious while portraying a man who has grown a bit weary of nonsense and red tape. This movie is devoid of hope. There is no optimism in Don't Look Up. Yes, it deserves comparison to Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, because it pulls laughs out of the fact that the human race is on a crash course with destruction. In Don't Look Up, the technology has multiplied and advanced, but the message is the same as it was when Slim Pickens rode that bomb to the doomed ground in Strangelove: Humans are messing up big-time, in a manner that is so egregious you just have to laugh at it ... to prevent yourself"
147,FZC_Doc7_Don't_Look_Up,FZC_Doc7_Don't_Look_Up,FZC,Comedy,Negative,Don't_Look_Up,"Adam McKay's progression from director of solid, if sophomoric, comedies like Anchorman, to humorless cosplay progressive scold has been a fascinating one. It started with the Oscar nominated The Big Short, and continued with Vice, in which McKay took recent history and tried to explain it to the masses in the most condescending terms possible, dressing up rank neoliberalism as progressive populism with zero self awareness. His latest, Don't Look Up, continues the trend, but rather than a glib history lesson, it's a work of satirical fiction designed to amplify and reflect the state of our COVID-addled world and the looming climate change crisis. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence star as scientists who discover a rogue comet that will intersect with Earth's orbit in six months and wipe out all of human life. Their warnings fall on deaf ears, from the corrupt American president (Meryl Streep) who's too concerned with midterms and a controversial Supreme Court nominee, a media who only wants to spoon feed good news, and a disinterested public, who are too invested in celebrity gossip to care about their impending doom. As the situation becomes more dire, corporations are called upon to solve the problem, but only make it worse as they seek to exploit the comet for profit. Don't Look Up often feels like the cinematic equivalent of watching the Democratic National Convention, as a lot of wealthy neoliberal politicians lecture the population about how every problem is our fault and the only way to fix it is to vote for them, repeat ad nauseam every election cycle with little change. Yes, it's a condescending lecture that is mostly preaching to the choir, wagging its finger at all the rubes for their part in destroying the world, trafficking in some deeply conservative personal responsibility politics - in essence scolding the entire audience and telling us ""we'd have solved global warming by now if it weren't for all YOU dumb assholes."" But beyond its deeply cynical political outlook, the biggest issue here is that it's just not funny. The satire is too broad, the targets too easy, the metaphors too obvious, it's scribbling its themes with the biggest, sloppiest marker possible, and the results are a complete mess. It's clearly very pleased with itself, but that self-satisfaction is it's biggest downfall because it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. The pacing feels all wrong, the editing is a nightmare, and every single performer involved seems completely baffled by its heavy-handed script. Rarely is such an impressive collection of talent so spectacularly wasted. That the filmmakers seem to think that any criticism of their film is tantamount to climate denial speaks to the film's completely wonky POV, completely unable to comprehend that is is the very brand of milquetoast Hollywood activism it seeks to satirize in the film's final act. If your idea of entertainment is being lectured by sanctimonious liberals who aren't telling you anything you don't already know but think they're being incredibly"

I will not say of writer-director Adam McKay, and his newest film, Don't Look Up, that he thinks his shit don't stink. On the contrary, I am fairly sure that McKay thinks his shit smells like lilac bushes on a bright May day, or like a luxurious bubble bath, or like oranges and cinnamon at Christmas. Perhaps he puts pails of his shit in every corner of the house to make it smell airier and more charming for his guests. Three times makes a trend, they say, and over his last three consecutive films - The Big Short in 2015, Vice in 2018, and Don't Look Up now - McKay has made it inescapably clear that, no matter who you are, what your expertise or life experience consists of, or what's at stake, he is serenely confident that he is much smarter than you are. There's one promising development, at least: Don't Look Up includes almost none of the exhausting stylistic tricks designed to make the film feel like a horrible living infographic found all over the other two movies. Almost right at the start, McKay and editor Hank Corwin literally stop the film in its tracks for an ironic, sarcastic title card and a visual cutaway, but this is basically the only time this happens; otherwise, they just let this be, like, a movie. An entirely bland, generic-looking movie, but it's better than the alternative. In any case, it mostly focuses on the travails of a pair of astronomers: Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), a PhD candidate at Michigan State University, and her advisor, Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio). The film is, incidentally, just flat-out fucking obsessed with describing Kate as ""a PhD candidate"", and speaking as a PhD candidate myself, I found this mind-numbing. It's a jargony way of describing a senior grad student that basically doesn't have any meaningful usage outside of the bureaucratic structure of higher education administration. But good for McKay, he did his research, so a PhD candidate it is to be. Anyway, Kate has just spotted a comet whipping its way straight towards Earth and when it arrives in a little bit more than six months, it will create an extinction level event. The two scientists must now communicate this fact to the world and try to goad people into taking immediate action to maybe do something that might stop this from happening, though they are not optimistic. The film that tumbles out over the course of 142 wildly aimless minutes is a sprawling grab-bag of unfunny and dumb satire and considerably less dumb character drama, though I think you could probably fit almost all of it into one of three large buckets: 1) metaphor for climate change and how we're not doing anything to stop it; 2)"

Having collected the year's most star-studded cast, one with a couple of dozen Oscar nominations among them, McKay is clearly gunning not only for awards glory but for a great big political statement. He's delivered one, all right. It's just one that's shudderingly obvious, and not particularly likely to convince anyone not already convinced. Don't Look Up is a satire of many things. It's a pretty straightforward allegory about climate change and the reaction to it, although it also works as an (accidental) metaphor for the COVID pandemic, and a general critique of Trump-era politics. It also wants to satirize social media, memes, reality TV, and other pastimes of modern life which are looked down on by the filmmakers. McKay wrote and directed, with a story-by-credit from David Sirota, the political journalist, and former Bernie Sanders staffer; the movie lands in theaters on December 10 and on Netflix on December 24. Don't Look Up stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as a pair of scientists who discover that a comet is headed straight for Earth, leading to the likely annihilation of the entire human race in about six months. They attempt to warn the government (in the person of Meryl Streep as a female president/Trump stand-in), but they're more concerned with short-term political considerations and ignore their help. The media is represented by both a bumbling New York Times-like newspaper and by a numbskull morning show hosted by Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett. These outlets are presented as much less concerned with the comet threat than they are with the latest bit of celebrity gossip (featuring Ariana Grande, poking some fun at herself as a shallow pop star.) Eventually, solutions promised and vetted by experts in the government are rejected in favor of a privatized mission led by a tech CEO (Mark Rylance, playing a combination of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk.) I would suspect that I agree with the overarching political views of most of the people involved in Don't Look Up, and I have no disagreement with them on the urgency of the climate crisis. The problem with the film is, the central allegory is both crushingly unsubtle, and, well, wrong. Part of why the response to climate change isn't what it should be is that the disaster is seen as both slow-moving, and far off in the distance. A comet on course to strike the Earth in six months would draw a completely different response than what we see in the movie, no matter how stupid the current presidential administration happens to be. As for the movie's shots at the media, such an event in real life would likely result in media inducing panic, rather than reacting with indifference. And the part with the Times-like newspaper, for instance, seems about 180 degrees from what the paper,"

A team of scientists alerts the President of the United States, who blows off the threat because it might negatively affect poll numbers. The scientists attempt to warn the public, a sizable portion of whom refuse to believe it's real because the president assures them it's a hoax. Proof is right there, yet these people simply won't accept it. Does any of this sound familiar? It should. Director Adam McKay (The Big Short) draws from the headlines for his latest effort, the dark comedy Don't Look Up. Unfortunately, the old saying about how it takes a lot of talented people to make a really bad movie totally applies here. Jennifer Lawrence plays PhD. candidate Kate Dibiasky. She discovers a ten-kilometer comet rocketing across the sky. Her astronomer supervisor, the Dr. Fauci-like Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio), does the math and determines that it's on a collision course with Earth. When it hits, it will be an extinction-level event. Mankind will be gone. They struggle to get a meeting at the White House. When they finally do, President Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep) doesn't take the matter seriously. She refuses to alert the public for fear that it will hurt her party in the upcoming midterms. Kate and Dr. Mindy force the issue by going on a Morning Joe-like program to sound the alarm, but the hosts (Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry) downplay it too. After all, bad news bums people out and makes them turn off their televisions. Once Orlean finally does acknowledge the situation, she politicizes it during her rallies, so that her supporters begin rebelling against scientific fact. A ""Don't look up"" movement arises, with people vowing not to gaze into the sky. They use their refusal to see the comet with their own eyes as proof of its non-existence. Other big names are in the cast, as well, including Timothee Chalamet as a skater dude who Kate befriends, Jonah Hill as Orlean's coattail-riding son, Mark Rylance as a spacy tech tycoon who claims to have a solution, and Ariana Grande as a pop singer whose recent breakup gets more press than the looming comet. McKay has stated that he intended to satirize climate change denial with this film. I'm sure that's true, but it's clear he drew several specific ideas from the response to Covid-19, as well. There are several problems with that. First, who wants to see a movie about denial idiocy when we're still right in the middle of it? Maybe this would be funny with some distance, but it sure isn't funny when you can see such behavior on a daily basis. Second, the politicizing of Covid  from Trump dubbing it a ""Democratic hoax"" to the incomprehensible defiance of the anti-vaccine/anti-mask crowd  is already a joke, so there's no way to spoof that. Nothing the film comes up with is as absurd as what we've already seen. Third, and perhaps most damaging, the movie has zero to"

It can be a risky move, building a film largely around three actors: there's so much that has to go right in order for it to work. However, if it works, you could have something special on your hands, as films like Ghostbusters (1984) have demonstrated. While Netflix's Red Notice doesn't involve ghosts, its premise is fairly unique, and the film is a ton of fun. Red Notice centers on the FBI's top profiler, Agent John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson), who is pursuing conman and thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). After a heist, Hartley is falsely accused of stealing one of three golden eggs that once belonged to Cleopatra, and this forces him to team up with Booth in order to catch the world's most wanted art thief, The Bishop (Gal Gadot), and clear his own name. Early on, Red Notice sets itself apart with an interesting premise. Even though I'm sure it plays with actual history a little bit, centering the story around Cleopatra's three eggs isn't something that I've seen before. Without much real-world background on the items that our characters are pursuing, it makes it harder to get an idea of where the story is going to go, which keeps you on your toes. Red Notice immediately shifts into high gear, which is rare for a film with an original screenplay. Usually, audiences spend the first 15 to 20 minutes of any given film listening to what is basically exposition, but Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber gives us about five minutes of that before basically diving right into the film's first major action sequence. While in more dramatic action films more worldbuilding and exposition would be welcome prior to getting into the action, with an action comedy you'd rather not have the audience be bored to death at any point. Red Notice doesn't drag things out and jumps right into the action: you get a little introduction, and that's frankly all you need. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and invites you to sit back, laugh, and enjoy the ride. This marks Dwayne Johnson's third collaboration with Marshall Thurber, after Central Intelligence (2016) and Skyscraper (2018). One of the biggest differences between this film and their previous collaborations is that Red Notice actually has a proper antagonist in Gal Gadot's The Bishop. It's a role I haven't really seen Gadot play before, and she does fairly well with it. She even gets to play off Johnson and Reynolds at certain points in ways that embrace her comedic and action star sides. loud and clear reviews red notice netflix action comedy Dwayne Johnson Ryan Reynolds Gal Gadot Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson star in Red Notice, releasing November 12, 2021 (Courtesy of Netflix) In terms of action, Red Notice feels like the closest we'll ever get"
152,HJY_Doc2_Red_Notice,HJY_Doc2_Red_Notice,HJY,Comedy,Positive,Red_Notice,"I am not entirely sure why writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber's action comedy Red Notice has been greeted with such a scathing critical response. Granted, it is hardly an original work or one that significantly pushes any boundaries or explores any new territory. And one could certainly argue with some justification that it coasts far too much on Ryan Reynolds's familiar snarky-deadpan banter (which could be said of a whole lot of Ryan Reynolds movies). But, at the same time, it is definitely entertaining and hits a few high notes here and there, especially when Reynolds's banter runs headlone into Dwayne Johnson's straight-man stoicism. Most of Thurber's previous films have been similarly high-concept comedic action vehicles like Central Intelligence (2016) and Skyscraper (2018)both of which, not incidentally, also starred Dwayne Johnsonalthough he first gained notice with Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), a cultishly funny-bizarre takedown of sports movie cliches that features a singularly unhinged performance by Ben Stiller. Thurber loves odd couples and weird conflicts and non-sequiturs, all of which he threads throughout Red Notice. The story concerns the competing agendas of two world-renowned art thieves, Reynolds's Nolan Booth and Gal Gadot's The Bishop, the former of whom is being pursued by Johnson's FBI agent John Hartley. For all his good deeds and hard work, Hartley is framed for an art theft and subsequently pursued by Interpol Inspector Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya), with whom he had previously worked in busting Booth. When Hartley finds himself sharing a Russian prison cell with Booth, he determines that the only way to clear his name is to work with his former nemesis to, first, break out of prison, and then steal several priceless eggs that were created for none other than Cleopatra and may very well not even exist (but, of course, we know they do). This involves all manner of covert hijinks and perfectly executed break-ins, including one in the mansion of Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos), a particularly ruthless drug dealer. The set-up is all thatset-upwhile the ostensible pay-off is the give and take among Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot (I am not sure that we are really supposed to care who ends up with the eggs). Johnson is all stone-faced business, while Reynolds provides the sarcasm and Gadot delivers plenty of droll, cool confidence as she repeatedly outsmarts both of them. And, when it works, it is quite engaging and funny, and the whole thing flies by like the lark it is. Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot deliver pretty much exactly what is expected of them, and Thurber sets up some good sequences, even if our engagement in them is sometimes foiled by less-than-convincing digital effects and their obviously derivative nature (at times it is hard not to expect that the Mission: Impossible theme will start playing). This is a casual movie for sure, but if you don't come in with high expectations for a serious film, it can be and is a good time. But, if you don't expect too much and"

The good news about Rawson Marshall Thurber's new film, also called ""Red Notice,"" is that this film critic won't be slapping a ""do not see"" tag on this action-adventure. This is pure escapist fun, powered by star-driven lead actors. The organically-trained cinephile will argue that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot don't do much acting in ""Red Notice,"" but that's exactly the idea. This Netflix-funded production is the perfect bowl of Halloween adult-stolen candy on a Friday night where the brain gets turned off and the smile count goes up. The plot revolves around Johnson's FBI profiler reluctantly teaming up with an art thief (Reynolds) to track down Cleopatra's legendary eggs, the luscious pearl of the art world in Thurber's film. The only thing in their way is Gadot's master criminal, who makes life hard for the wise-cracking duo. Hot on all three of their trails is Interpol (aka red notice stamper) Inspector Das (Ritu Arya). The locales start in Rome and race around the world, including stops in London and Argentina. Much of what you expect to happen does indeed occur, but that's not the point. Escapist fun is rarely smart and doesn't carry much depth, but the nice thing here is that the humor outweighs the mindless action. Yes, there are car chases, fist fights, gun battles, and every other kind of genre quota-meeting attackbut the laughs are frequent and well-earned. The J - April 2025 After my chaotic morning, I turned this on and got lost in the craziness of it all. No human being could bounce off a brick roof, get electrocuted, punched and kicked a hundred times, and still manage to travel across the world in model-esque clothing. If you came to a movie where The Rock jumps off a poorly-constructed bridge-which is attached to a black site (for really bad people) prison-in the hopes of catching a moving helicopter in an extremely cold weather area for an award-caliber script, you reached the wrong room. 'Red Notice"" is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek entertainment. This is the movie you watch after ""Remains of the Day"" for a palette cleanser. Thurber's script won't win a cinematic Pulitzer and the story is quite outlandish, but the roles in it are perfectly tailored for the star's talents. Gadot, who is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, is known to most moviegoers as the heroic Wonder Woman, so seeing her play the official ""heel,"" aka the antagonist, is a surprising thrill. instead of being the hero pursuing the bad parties, it's Gadot waiting for the boys to come to the yard.

She then throws it to the ground, shattering it. It's not a real egg, but a fake substitute  as you'd expect, since you're watching a movie, in which all the priceless valuables are props. Con men, art dealers and movies are all obsessed with lies and truth and the space between the two. Rawson Marshall Thurber's clever script is a shell game of plot twists and head fakes which keeps daring you to notice, or care, that you're watching a scam, a forgery and a fiction. It's a shallow pleasure  but what can you expect from an art form that is constantly passing off plaster as gold? ""Red Notice"" starts with FBI profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) pursuing art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) as he tries to steal three ancient Egyptian eggs supposedly given to Cleopatra. Hartley and Booth are both being targeted by another art thief, The Bishop (Gal Gadot), who through cleverer-than-thou machinations gets them sent to an Interpol black site. The narrative tangles and re-tangles from there, racing through masked balls, South American jungles, improbable bullfights, and various betrayals. Imposter eggs and imposter backstories proliferate, and everyone turns out to be someone other than who you thought they were. In ""Ocean's 12,"" part of the heist involved bringing a character played by Julia Roberts in to pretend to be Julia Roberts. ""Red Notice"" is similarly gleeful about the way the sham of moviemaking and the sham of cons overlap. In the first line of the movie, Inspector Das tells Hartley, ""You're not a cop,"" to which he responds, ""You're right, I'm not."" Because, of course, he isn't. He's Dwayne Johnson, an actor playing a cop. (""You don't look like a profiler,"" another colleague observes. ""I get that a lot,"" says Johnson, who looks like a movie star.) Other winks are even more blatant. The characters are constantly referencing other films. If they're traveling, they're talking about ""Sullivan's Travels."" If they're looking at a watch, they're talking about ""Pulp Fiction."" They even work in a reference to ""Cats,"" for some reason. In that bullfight scene, Booth tells Hartley to stay still because bulls can only see you when you move  and then there's an extended discussion about whether Booth got that information from a nature documentary or is misremembering ""Jurassic Park."" Is it David Attenborough or Richard Attenborough? Movies and real life, who can tell them apart? At one point, Booth critiques Bishop's entrance; at another he offers to give notes on Hartley's performance (or is it Johnson's?) He says ""scene!"" at the end of scenes. He calls the egg they're searching for a MacGuffin. The best grifters (and actors) make it a pleasure to participate in your own bamboozlement.

Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot in Red Notice. (Photo Courtesy of Netflix  2021) This slick and absolutely vapid star vehicle, with more twists and turns than a pretzel, tests the algorithms and limits of tentpole moviemaking on streaming screens. Shot in multiple countries, Red Notice promises the world but doesn't quite hit the mark in its endeavours; banking far too heavily on three of Hollywood's best, leading to what could probably be the movie's top undoing. Like the Indiana Jones franchise, Red Notice is propelled by the mythology of ancient artefacts and the greed they attract. Johnson plays John Hartley, an FBI profiler who locks up notorious art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) only to end up framed for the same crime and thrown in a prison cell with Booth. Both men find out to their chagrin that they have been played by the Bishop (Gal Gadot), a femme fatale art thief hell-bent on stealing all three of Cleopatra's mythic golden eggs to sell on the black market. According to this movie's legend, over 2,000 years ago Roman general Mark Antony gifted his lover, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra, with these golden eggs. After their suicide pack, the three eggs were dispersed. One becomes an exhibit at Museo Nazionale. Another is with a private collector. The third has been lost for centuries. The audience is taken on a cat-and-mouse game that leads the characters to exotic and breathtaking locations like Bali, Rome and Argentina, though these backdrops are not explored by the characters or even shown much on-screen beyond title cards announcing the destination. With such a whopping movie budget and star cast to work with, one would have imagined original stories for their characters, but instead, have to deal with all of them suffering from father issues. Hartley and Booth turn out to have similarly dysfunctional childhoods, stemming from deadbeat fathers. However, instead of using this to add substance to the character, what we are left with are long-winded summaries of their lives that are so banal, they don't provide any emotional branches for the audience to grasp. Even scenes that are meant to be funny lose their impact on the audience with the unlikely pair of Hartley and Booth winding up tethered by a common aim of finding the golden eggs. As they come after the ruthless Bishop, who takes the guise of a below-average rendered copy of a femme fatale, their dubious partnership shreds under a script scattered with dreadful dialogue that leaves the audience unimpressed. One cannot help feel the script copies from a compilation of cinematic references to assemble the movie's events.

It's funny to watch him and think of him as an FBI profiler with that body. It's not to say that there isn't one FBI profiler out there with a bodybuilder physique, but it strains credulity. It was the biggest laugh in the film when Johnson says his title with a straight face. It's also pretty boring that every thief, law enforcement agent, archeologist, and treasure hunter is also an expert in mixed martial arts. It's obvious why this is exciting for the audience because we are treated to complex moves, impressive stunt ensemble performances, and deft, if a little too quick, cutting from combatants to reactions and back to combatants. Though, what happened to the exciting thought of a cat and mouse thriller on its own? Why can't an art thief and their platonic lover of a law enforcement agent just be that? It always comes down to firing endless amounts of bullets and blowing up lots and lots of things. Rawson Marshall Thurber's intriguing game of a script is bogged down in action set pieces. Red Notice's characters are failed by the lack of interest in their development or stories. They become weapons of mass quipping, firing off charms and sensuality without having anything to back them up, which makes the eventual twists, double crosses, and triple crosses a bit of a shrug toward a lackluster emotional landing. Though, Gal Gadot has never been more interesting than she is as a smarmy antagonist with a few screws loose. What keeps you invested in seeing the film to the end is that there is a twist. The clues are there throughout the whole movie and the idea is at the back of your mind, but to put it all together completely is very difficult, which is the mark of a good twist. There are no red herrings to follow, just an itch on the back of your neck that won't be satisfied. Though, as soon as the twist is revealed, the film takes a downward turn that makes you wonder if they thought of anything beyond that point other than, ""could there be franchise potential here?"" It would be better to write that Red Notice is horrible, that the filmmakers had no idea what they're doing or that it looks poor. Yet, Red Notice is competently made and with intention. It's something you'd expect to have a car commercial in the midst of a chase scene and to hint at a more exciting world of gentleperson art thieves, but never really get there. It's a fair to middling action comedy that's got three of the biggest stars in the world doing everything they possibly can to charm you into submission.

It's a high concept, completely original pitch that comes packing no shortage of blatantly obvious franchise potential, bankrolled by one of the most powerful outfits in the industry to the tune of $200 million. Thrown in a trio of genuine box office draws and A-list megastars via Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, a breezy plot that takes place in a string of glamorous locations across the world, and everything about Red Notice is a slam dunk in theory. However, in execution, it's not even close to being the sum of its parts. Don't get us wrong, Red Notice isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination; in fact, it's frequently a fast-paced and frantic delight. That being said, the sheer megawatt star power of the leads papers over the cracks in the narrative to a very noticeable degree, to the extent that it feels as though the banter is the only thing keeping it from collapsing into itself at points. Writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber got his start in comedy, following up Dodgeball with We're the Millers and Central Intelligence, but he's banking on being an action guy now, and there isn't much evidence that it's his strong suit. His last collaboration with Johnson in Skyscraper boasts many of the same glaring flaws as Red Notice; namely ropey CGI, an artificial sheen permeating the majority of the backdrops and set pieces that lean much harder into the workmanlike than the spectacular, and it's a shame to report that things haven't improved between the two blockbusters. The plot, which is oxymoronically easy to follow but still somehow convoluted once the pieces start falling into place, kicks off in Rome. Johnson's FBI profiler John Hartley is hot on the tail of Reynolds' master thief Nolan Booth, before they both find themselves in the cross hairs of Gal Gadot's Bishop. That's pretty much the setup in a nutshell, but that's more than enough. The action sequences start and then they really don't stop, so you'll never be anything less than fitfully entertained. There's a mountain of exposition to get through, though, and it comes in many forms; flashbacks, voiceovers, heart-to-hearts, visual aids, lengthy monologues and more. It's a regular problem for Hollywood blockbusters to explain their lore in painful, often excruciating levels of detail, and Red Notice is no different in that regard. Instead of focusing on a single, unified tone, Red Notice throws almost every imaginable subgenre of action cinema into the mix, and while several of the sojourns don't really land, a great deal of them do.

For every stinker like Bright or 6 Underground, there's been a relative hit like Extraction or Army of the Dead, which might not end up on a critics' year-end list but certainly clears the bar of ""watchable enough that a Netflix subscriber shouldn't be flipping through their phone during most of its running time."" In theory, viewing numbers for a movie would be the streaming equivalent of a box office haul. But setting aside the fact that Netflix's viewership metrics are both shrouded in secrecy and self-reportedand therefore should be taken with an ocean's worth of saltit appears the company cares about quality to go with its quantity. Despite Netflix's claim that 6 UndergroundMichael Bay's explosive(ly stupid) interpretation of the Mission: Impossible franchisewas one of the most-watched original movies in the streamer's history, the company won't pursue a sequel because it felt the film was a letdown creatively. (The decision is a bit more puzzling considering that Bright, by all accounts a film with as lowly a reputation as 6 Underground, will move forward with a sequel.) Netflix's decision-making remains hard to discern from the outside looking in, but the streamer has nevertheless become something of a refuge for a type of film that's been increasingly crowded out of the theatrical landscape: the non-IP blockbuster. The company's latest buzzy and original tentpole, Red Notice, is indicative of this shift. As traditional studios double down on superhero franchises and other forms of recognizable IP, there's even less room for original blockbusters. On the whole, studios are more comfortable wringing every last drop from properties that audiences are familiar with rather than run the risk of trying something new, which can explain how a project like Red Notice landed in Netflix's lap. Back in 2018, Red Notice, a globe-trotting action-adventure caper about rival art thieves and the FBI agent on their tail, was green-lit at Universal as the latest collaboration between writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber and Dwayne Johnson (see: Central Intelligence and Skyscraper). But Universal ultimately got cold feet about footing the bill, perhaps in part due to Skyscraper's somewhat modest gross for the studio, which was particularly disappointing in North America. Instead, Red Notice was acquired by Netflix, where, with a budget that reportedly reached $200 million, it became the streamer's most expensive movie to date. It's not the first time Netflix has scooped up a project a major studio balked"

My nerves are still deadened from The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, so Red Notice passed in a harmless haze, not making me feel good, but definitely not making me feel as bad as Bodyguard. Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, Red Notice stars Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot, a trio of likeable screen presences designed to appeal to as many people as possible. Red Notice is designed with a similar mass appeal in mind, with broad comedy (""comedy"") beats and bog standard action sequences, and a blatantly franchising baiting ending that makes me hope there is no sequel, just out of spite. Stop doing this, movies! Just END! As suave-ish thief Nolan, Reynolds gives an idea of what it might have looked like if he played Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie. Nolan is a renowned art thief busy knocking over a museum in Italy when super-agent John Hartley (Johnson) shows up with Interpol in tow. The two end up destroying a major museum in the process of playing cat-and-mouse, and ultimately are set up at patsies for another renowned thief, The Bishop (Gadot). Does this sound twisty? It's not! Red Notice has all the feel of a heist movie with a buddy cop dynamic between Nolan and Hartley, but it's executed in the most basic way possible, with little flare or personality by Thurber. He certainly knows how to stage action sequences, and having worked with Johnson before on Skyscraper and Central Intelligence, he knows how to utilize The Rock. But still, Red Notice falls flat. It is, at least, passably watchable. Like if you put this on while doing something else at home, you probably won't mind it. But I kept thinking about Logan Lucky, a heist movie with memorable characters and a heist with real stakes for those characters, which are the missing elements in Red Notice. There's just no there there. The characters are only memorable for the actor schtick inhabiting them: Nolan is a motor mouth smart ass, as are all Ryan Reynolds characters in films of this ilk; Hartley is The Rock; The Bishop is a sexy lady who kicks ass. What else about them? Nothing. There is nothing else. And what of the crime? Well, Nolan and The Bishop are each angling to be the best thief in the world, and Hartley wants to clear his name. Except maybe not?! Nothing matters, we keep changing sides! Again, this is not the worst movie I've seen this year. I wasn't mad after sitting through it. But I also have already forgotten it, and I bet you do, too, ten minutes after seeing it. There are lots of references to Indiana Jones and James Bond, but none of the wit or style of same.

Films like ""The Mexican"" (Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts), ""The Tourist"" (Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie), ""Knight and Day"" (Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz), or ""The Devil's Own"" (Harrison Ford and Pitt); the tradition goes back through 1984's ""City Heat"" (Burt Reynolds, Clint Eastwood), 1972's ""Pocket Money"" (Paul Newman, James Coburn) and beyond. All these movies were marketed with posters that featured the stars prominently and little about the plot; they relied on star wattage, along with the hope audiences wouldn't ask for their money back. How could those stars have picked such a bad script? How could actors who've made so many of my favorite movies choose to make that dud? These are the questions you'd be asking yourself as you left the theater, your ticket money now securely in someone else's pocket. These days, we're in the age of digital streaming, and you're already paying a certain amount each month for unlimited access to movies and shows both old and new. Which is why it's interesting that Netflix's ""Red Notice,"" a movie that doesn't even really have the need for a ""poster,"" still tries to pull off one of the oldest cons in the book. Three superstars at the height of their powers! No script that has any reason for existing! Don't bother popping the popcorn. From its opening moments, setting up the entire film, it leaves you scratching your head. FBI criminal profiler John Hartley (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is in Rome chasing after Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), who considers himself to be the best international art thief in the world. After a convoluted chain of events, Hartley is made to look like he's not really in the FBI, then is sent to a Russian prison atop a snowy mountain, where he is bunking with Booth, who he arrested just moments prior. Much of this is being engineered by ""The Bishop"" (Gal Gadot), who actually is the world's greatest international art thief. All of this can be straightened out in moments with a simple phone call; no such call is made. As you can imagine, there's a lot of double-crossing, triple-crossing, international travel and costume changes in this ""Indiana Jones meets 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'"" production written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Central Intelligence""). The three stars are chasing each other around in pursuit of three priceless, bejeweled eggs that Cleopatra once received as a wedding gift and were subsequently scattered to the far reaches of the planet. The only way these three will be able to romance the stones (sorry, eggs) will be if they work  plot twist!  together. It's hard to pick the most cloying aspect of ""Red Notice."" It"
161,JVL_Doc1_Taken,JVL_Doc1_Taken,JVL,Action,Positive,Taken,"Imagine Jason Bourne fifteen years after his trilogy of adventures, now retired, divorced, and with a teenage daughter. He's still the loner type, sleeping in chairs instead of beds out of habit, unable to shut down his obsessive training and attention to detail. Ready to spark into action at any moment, he kills out of reflex. With a broken family to protect, his abilities slumber until awoken. And when you mess with his personal life, he fights back, unleashing a harsh vengeance that's unmatched no matter how many goons you assign to stop him. That's Liam Neeson's character in Taken. Of course, Neeson isn't playing a middle-aged version of techno-stomping action hero Jason Bourne; Matt Damon wouldn't dare relinquish his title so willingly. Rather, his name is Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA ""preventor"" who's given up his license to kill and life of international travel to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), though she lives with her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) in her stepdad's mansion. On her birthday, Kim gets a horsie and a party and lots more, but she also wants to go to Paris on vacation with her friend. Bryan doesn't think it's a good idea, and when your former superspy dad advises against something, you should really listen. Because he loves his little girl, he agrees to the trip. First thing off the plane, Kim and her friend virtually ask to be kidnapped when they share a cab with a strange man, who proceeds to ask them questions about where they're staying and so forth, which Kim and her friend willingly answer without a hint of suspicion. Kim's French holiday turns out pretty lousy when she's later kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers. Luckily, she made a call to Daddy before she was ripped away from the phone. Bryan knows the score. A few telephone calls to his former associates later, and he's hot on the trail of bad guys doing scummy things. Unlike the aforementioned Bourne, Neeson's character has some emotional involvement beyond saving his own skin. He's on a desperate search, using harsh skills any parent of a kidnapped child wishes they had. While outsmarting local authorities, he tears into the Parisian underworld and leaves few alive to tell the tale. He kills without compunction in a perilous search to find his daughter, and while normally such unrelenting remorselessness might turn off some viewers, we never blame Bryan for his extreme prejudice. And indeed, his retaliations are extreme, as he tortures and kills execution-style those involved in the kidnapping. It might be suggested that Bryan is a symbol of American militarism, storming in and killing everyone in sight when one of his own gets into trouble, except the subtext in this yarn is too thin to analyze with any seriousness. Neeson offers a performance that won't earn him any praise for nuance or multilayeredness, but he creates a singular force, believable enough in his deep voice that, to be sure, his character can and will do"
162,JVL_Doc2_Taken,JVL_Doc2_Taken,JVL,Action,Positive,Taken,"Taken's"" greatest asset resides within the perfectly cast Liam Neeson and the deliberate build of his fascinatingly merciless character. Rather than jump directly into the advertised plot, the film is careful to explore the anti-hero's troubled relationships and hint at the dark past that allows him to transform into the ruthlessly efficient soldier requisite for the task at hand. Halfway through the film, when audiences discover to what extent the protagonist is willing to go to accomplish his mission, it's impossible not to be engaged in his brutally unrelenting plight. Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job of long hours and dangerous work in an attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But with a restrictive ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and his naturally overprotective impulses, he finds the young woman drifting further away. Not wanting to compound their strained relationship, Bryan reluctantly permits Kim to vacation in Paris, giving her more freedom than he's comfortable with. Things quickly spiral out of control when she's kidnapped by Albanian slave traders from her hotel room. Now, in a desperate and deadly quest, Bryan will stop at nothing to track down those responsible, to save his daughter from the clutches of a depraved organization. Luc Besson certainly has an obsession with shady men with checkered pasts, forced to delve into disturbing criminal underworlds to seek redemption and vigilante justice. Antiheroes come in many styles, and although some critics may scour at unoriginal aspects of Liam Neeson's Bryan, the man still knows how to be a badass. In the rescue of his daughter, he has no limits; this creates many unexpected scenes of exercising an iron will and a frightening determination, which finds a seemingly heroic man donning a guise of villainy. And yet, all of it feels righteous  it's a testament to character design when the hero can remain a hero even after viciously torturing criminals or shooting innocent people to force a few quick answers. He may not be entirely unique, but this hardboiled, unflinching ""preventer"" is simply fixating. ""Taken"" is an action film connoisseur's perfect guilty pleasure. Bubbling over with chase sequences, shootouts (the kind where the baddies supply all the firepower), and fistfights, it takes on a realism not found in many of the action-for-the-sake-of-action flicks of recent years. Bryan's hand-to-hand combat skills don't rely on flamboyant or showy martial arts, instead taking a more realistic approach, with plenty of one-hit takedowns and throat-chops that effectively subdue the enemy in a stealthier manner. The authenticity of it all may be negotiable, but it's refreshing to see simpler forms of attacking and defending  and it's certainly more believable when random gun-toting henchmen aren't prepared with perfect kung-fu fighting techniques to combat the specially trained protagonist. ""Taken"" prides itself on its serious, dark tone. The villains' atrocities are amplified by their detestable trade; they will receive no sympathy from viewers when they get what's coming to them. The hero is also rather remorseless,"
163,JVL_Doc3_Taken,JVL_Doc3_Taken,JVL,Action,Positive,Taken,"Genre films are beginning to creep back into theaters after the big parade of Oscar-contenderspraise be to Godand one of them, a little actioner called Taken, is now tops at the box-office and deserves a quick hosanna. (Not that the Oscar nominees aren't an exciting topic too. Oh golly no. I've been meaning to write all about them and somehow just haven't gotten around to it. After all, what could be more riveting than making a case for which heart-tugging spectacle should win Best Picture, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or Slumdog Millionaire? Or wondering whether Meryl Streep even has room in her bathroom for another Oscar? Stars all keep their awards in their bathrooms, see, to show how joshy and down-to-earth they are! It's fascinating!) Taken is a short, punchy B-movie, countering the ever-longer and more brooding big-budget action spectacles we've been seeing for a while now (the Bournes, the Bonds, the Batmans). Luc Besson, best known for directing La Femme Nikita, The Professional, and The Fifth Element, is producer and co-screenwriter here (with frequent collaborator Robert Mark Kamen), and through his company Europacorp he's grinding out consistently lively B-action fare like the Transporter series, assorted Jett Li movies, etc. Besson and director Pierre Morel last gave us the eye-popper 2004 action-fan-fave District B13. Their new one, Taken, is an old-fashioned vigilante film about a father rescuing his daughter from sex slavers who will, naturally, die in droves. The formula is freshened up with some unlikely casting: Liam Neeson as the lethal dad. Neeson is one of those stodgy respected actors, Irish, obviously, and with all sorts of classic stage roles and prestige pictures to his credit. He's an odd fit for the part of an ex-CIA American with an impressive homicidal skill-set who's given it all up in order to repair his relationship with his teenage daughter (Maggie Grace). But it works pretty well. Neeson is sad-faced and lumbering and low-wattage, which is great for the early scenes when he goes through the ritual everyday-life humiliations that will key us all up to watch him do maximum damage later. He lives in a crap apartment in L.A., and he's scorned by his gratuitously mean ex-wife (Famke Janssen, who really ought to think about whether she needs the money this bad) and her rich buffoon of a second husband (Xander Berkeley). Sad Dad also has to take stupid jobs to get by, like guarding a Britney-esque pop singer at a concert where someone with a sensitive ear for music is sure to want her dead. In his free time, he sits around at home staring at photos of his daughter. Some action fans will wonder if we needed to see quite so much corny daughter-love and cringy dad-humiliation before getting to the action. It IS a little weird, the lingering thoroughness of the set-up. But it makes sense in the long run. They're piling it on in the old-melodrama style, so that when the daughter finally gets abducted"

Wendy (played by Michelle Williams) is the sort of woman you might see on the street  slender, medium height, short dark hair, jeans and T-shirt, wearing a vaguely wounded expression, with a shy, diffident manner, almost to the point of being affectless, but entirely benign and peaceful. Lucy, for her part, is a friendly, nondescript mutt. The innocent title sequence gives way to something a bit sketchier. As night falls, Lucy runs ahead into the woods and Wendy catches up with her at a campfire where a group of potentially menacing neo-hobos are sitting around loudly bragging about their exploits. The mood of suppressed violence builds. We begin to wonder why Wendy is hanging out with them. Maybe she should think about heading home. But then she's back in her car, and we suddenly realize that her car is her home, that Wendy and Lucy are on the road  specifically, from Indiana to Alaska to find work in the canneries, and now they've come to rest, tentatively, somewhere in Oregon. Their money has just run out. Wendy and Lucy is a portrait of the blues. It's tempting to imagine that this ultra-naturalistic, hard-scrabble chronicle of a migrant-laboring woman and her dog came tumbling out of the movie chute at exactly the right moment, that director Kelly Reichardt and co-writer Jonathan Raymond somehow foresaw the current economic distress that Wendy seems to symbolize and timed the production perfectly to fit the national predicament. But Wendy would probably be just as unmoored in any time and place. It's in her nature. doclands documentary film festival, smith rafael film center In her we can see a bit of Sandrine Bonnaire's defiant female drifter in Agnes Varda's Vagabond, as well as the passive, inward-bending body language of the young ""models"" in Robert Bresson's later films, weakly struggling against their fate. Wendy's weary road trip takes a few of the same turns we've witnessed in, say, Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven or any number of American hard-luck screen stories of life on the road. The lonely, melancholy rhythms are familiar and so are the details. Filmmakers Reichardt and Raymond, who collaborated on the eccentric 2006 character study Old Joy (also set in the Oregon forests) know the emotional landscape well  Wendy and Lucy is adapted from Raymond's short story ""Train Choir."" They're determined to make us see and feel the same things Wendy does, and it's a humbling, completely absorbing experience.

Neeson is an antidote to all the barely past puberty action pukes and convinces us that he'll kill anyone and everyone if you take from him. It's a true testament that Neeson simply knocks this role out of the park. ""Taken"" however feels like Luc Besson was behind the scenes injecting his own flow and skill. Imagine my surprise when his name popped up in the credits. ""Taken"" makes no illusions that it's deeper than we see on the trailer, but it does thankfully fill in the dramatic motivation behind the plot of a parent desperately looking for his daughter in 96 hours after she's kidnapped and sold in to sex slavery. Director Pierre Morel takes us through the underbelly of various English and Parisian landmarks as Neeson looks to mercilessly destroy any and everyone who stands in his way. This leaves us with a searing bit of biting tension and atmosphere as his rush is met with endless henchmen, mob bosses, and even the authorities who set themselves up against Neeson's character. If the casting of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne was a shot out of the park, Neeson holds his own as an aged ex-spy who uses his own skills to gather clues and find out why his daughter has been taken. Neeson's choreography and character makes the film such an achievement and it's a blast to see him putting down the sleaze in the UK. Though plagued with the dumbest villains ever to grace the screen, Neeson shines along side co-star Maggie Grace who convinces as a teenager and aces her part as a victim of crime ring who pleads for help and is taken through the shredder by violent traffickers. I had a blast sitting through ""Taken"" and while it's not perfect, it's one I'll be seeking when it comes to DVD here in the states. Pierre Morel's direction is great with an energy highly derivative from Luc Besson's own which is forgiven when Neeson comes on screen and reminds us that a skilled actor who works wonders as an action star and ex spy.

Bryan's worst fears are quickly realized when Kim and her friend are abducted in Paris by a group of Albanian mobsters running a slave trade. As a result, Bryan heads to Europe and proceeds to unleash his wrath on everyone in his path  determined to find his daughter and bring her back home. Neeson probably wouldn't be my first, or even 100th, choice as an action hero, but he does an OK job here, bringing a much needed intensity to his role. Unfortunately, he is stuck in a film that peaks after a great abduction sequence and subsequent phone conversation between Bryan and Kim's abductors. This one scene, which the studio has given away in all the movie's trailers, is as tense and thrilling as anything in ""The Bourne Identity"" and its sequels. But after this scene, ""Taken"" dissolves nearly into a parody of those ""Bourne"" films, with Neeson easily ousting every bad guy he comes in contact with. Perhaps if the film had gone all the way, not toning down the violence and sleaziness that surrounds Kim's abduction, this could have worked. Instead, the audience is stuck with a film that is way nicer than it should be. Sure it makes the subject matter easier to take, but in the long run it really limits the film's overall effectiveness, making it nothing more than a borderline guilty pleasure.

Kim is so irritating. Kim is so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. 'Bryan,' I'd have said to him if I could, 'you're better off without her; so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Now, let's go eat.' But doting dads are doting dads, I guess, and there is just no stopping him, which is a shame, as what follows is a big sorry mess of the most clicheed, improbable and xenophobic kind. 'Bryan,' I'd have also said,' I am very hungry and if I don't have supper soon I shall faint.' I probably wouldn't have fainted  have yet to faint, ever  but I think I'd have tried anything, pulled out all the stops. Still, I wouldn't have added that I'd tear down the Eiffel Tower if I had to, as that's just silly. The film opens in California; happy, sunny California where you are safe because bad, swarthy foreigners can't get to you. That's the feeling, anyway, and it is weird, I agree. After all, Besson is French and Neeson is Irish but there you have it. There must just be no accounting for pro-American fervour and sentimentalism sometimes, although an eye on the box office must help. Anyway, we are introduced to Bryan: big, tough Bryan who has retired early so he can live nearer to and get closer to 'Kimmy', who lives with his ex-wife and her husband, Stuart, a zillionaire. Stuart is always outclassing Bryan. Bryan gives Kim a karaoke machine for her 17th birthday. Stuart gives her a pony. Ouch! That cliche always hurts. And, boy, does Kim squeal excitedly when she sees that pony. Kim, you are already thinking, deserves whatever is coming to her. Bring it on! Lay her out! What is coming to Kim? Well, Kim wants to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, another pampered babe of the flouncing kind, but daddy won't have it. He knows the world and there are bad people out there, he tells Kim. Hell's bells, they probably lace the croissants with crack in Paris. Still, he eventually consents with strict warnings about phoning every ten minutes.

This was Nemescu's first feature as a director, and we will never know exactly how the finished film would have looked; the regret, though deep, is not all-consuming, because ""California Dreamin' "" bears almost no trace of the tyro. It could use a trim, but only rarely does it strain for effect, and, for a young man, Nemescu was uncannily versed in the emotions of middle agefree-floating rancor, the creak of unhelpful wisdom, and a covetous sigh at the spectacle of lust. If it's regret you want, don't mourn the director; just watch his movie. The year is 1999, during the conflict in Kosovo, and the place is Constanta, Romania, on the Black Sea. A platoon of American marines has arrived with a shipment of military radar, to be deployed near the Serbian border in support of air raids by the NATO coalition. The plan is to put the equipment on a train and escort it across Romania: hardly an errand to perplex the guy in charge, Captain Jones (Armand Assante). That's what he thinks. On a sleepy summer's day, the train grinds into a railroad station in the village of Capalnita, at the back end of nowhere, to be met by the devil incarnate. His name is Doiaru (Razvan Vasilescu), he is the stationmaster, and, like all the best Beelzebubs, he doesn't look the part. With his lined and grizzled face, poised to crease into a smile, he could be the gentlest of patriarchs; but the man is a beast, who has built up a black market, terrorized the other villagers, and brought a nearby factory to its knees. He loves his daughter Monica (Maria Dinulescu), a sullen beauty of seventeen, but his loveor, as she sees it, his dread of being alonevents itself as a fearsome wish to control. No wonder she longs to cut loose. And here comes her chance: a herd of American boys, as dazed and horny as bullocks in the wrong pasture. They expect a brief halt, instead of which they linger for five days and browse among the locals. This is because Doiaru uncouples the engine and demands customs documentation, which nobody seems able to provide. Single-handed, in other words, he blocks the progress of American might, and why? A succession of haunting flashbacks to his own boyhood, in the Second World War, when he waited for Allied help that never came, suggests a possible cause, but Vasilescu's earthy performance tells of something more stubbornly rooted: a force of ill will, which cannot abide the good will of others.

Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative trying to patch up a shaky history with his teenage daughter, Kim. He's left the world of espionage behind in order to be closer to her, but it's clear from the beginning that he's still struggling to connect. Kim lives with her mother, Lenore, and her wealthy stepfather, and Bryan exists on the periphery, trying to be present while constantly reminded that he no longer has a central place in his daughter's life. When Kim announces she wants to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, Bryan is instantly wary. He knows too much about the dangers of the world, and the idea of his daughter traveling abroad without protection makes him nervous. Despite not being her legal guardian and having no real say in her decisions, Kim insists on asking for his approvalperhaps as a way to build a bridge, or maybe just out of habit. Against his better judgment, Bryan agrees, though he lays down strict rules about her checking in frequently. It's not long after Kim and Amanda arrive in Paris that Bryan receives a panicked phone callhis daughter is being kidnapped by a group of human traffickers. In a chilling and now iconic scene, he listens helplessly on the phone as Kim is taken, issuing his famous ""I will find you, and I will kill you"" speech to the kidnapper. From that moment on, the film transitions into a relentless, single-minded pursuit. Bryan boards the next flight to Paris and begins tearing through the city's underworld in an effort to track down his daughter before she disappears into the sex trade forever. There are certainly a few nuances in the characters and their relationships, most of which occur in the film's first act. The tension between Bryan and Lenore, his awkward attempts to reconnect with Kim, and the undercurrent of regret in his every interaction give the film a bit of emotional texture. But make no mistake: Taken is not a character drama. Like almost everything Luc Besson has had a hand in, it's about the action, not the writing. The film moves at a breakneck pace, with hand-to-hand combat, shootouts, and chase scenes making up the bulk of the runtime. Neeson is unexpectedly convincing as an action herogrim, efficient, and unrelenting. His performance elevates the film from what could've been a forgettable B-movie into something more memorable. Still, the narrative is thin, the villains are cartoonish, and the depiction of Paris as a city crawling with predators feels over-the-top and borderline xenophobic. Ultimately, Taken works best if you don't think too hard about it. It's a fast, brutal revenge thriller with just enough emotional motivation to justify its violence. It won't win any awards for depth or originality, but it delivers exactly what it promises: one man, on a mission, destroying everything in his path to save his daughter."

In the violent, churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken, he's a suave, power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who, in truth, is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (he's an ex-husband, as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And he's paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a ""preventer"" (""I prevented bad things from happening"") that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regretif he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours he's torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower.First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers' cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding: ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of France's leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on a"

Nice to see you on screens everywhere embodied to impossible perfection by Margot Robbie. So what's an existential line about deatha topic the Mattel toy company never considered when they introduced the plastic Barbie doll in 1959 doing in a pretty-in-pink fantasia that's built to be the party movie of the summer? Glad you asked. It's part of a plan from Greta Gerwig (""Little Women""), the Oscar nominated director of ""Lady Bird"" who wrote the subversively funny script with her partner Noah Baumbach, to give audiences what Gerwig calls, ""the thing you didn't know you wanted."" So let's jump back a minute. Until Barbie quits a disco dance to ask disturbing questions, her movie rides high on a pink cloud of feminist wish fulfillment in which Barbies come in all shapes, sizes and colors. There's a President Barbie (Issa Rae), an all-Barbie Supreme Court, a Barbie played by trans actress Hari Nef and, well, you get the woke picture. Robbie's so-called ""Stereotypical Barbie"" floats through Barbielandgorgeously imagined by Gerwig and her dazzling design teamconcerned with fashion and party choices. Guys? They're beach accessories, even the Ken doll that the irresistibly hilarious and heartfelt Ryan Gosling brings to such sweet, clueless life. ""I'm just Ken,"" he sings, as if that's enough. Hook-ups don't really apply even when Ken asks to stay over for the night. ""For what?"" asks a wide-eyed Barbie. ""I'm actually not sure,"" says Ken. Robbie and Gosling are a match made in movie heaven. And Gerwig could have sent her ""Barbie"" to box-office glory simply by riding the safe surface of her comic vision. That, of course, goes against everything Gerwig stands for as a filmmaker who lives to probe under the Hollywood veneer. As a producer as well as a star, Robbie chose Gerwig to steer her Barbie ship fully knowing that risk is part of the Gerwig equation. Innocence goes out the window when Weird Barbie (the great Kate McKinnon) tells Robbie's stereotypical version to banish her fears about cellulite, flat feet and mortality by entering the real world. Shot in Los Angelesarguably the most unreal place in Americathe film switches gears into a toxic universe ruled by the patriarchy. It's a revelation for Ken and his fellow dudes, including Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir and Michael Cera, but hell for Barbie. Gerwig's ambition is indisputable, but her goals can also trip her up. She satirizes the greed of Mattel executives, led by a boobish Will Ferrell, who only want to exploit Barbie for fun and profit. But she's doing the same thing since the movie couldn't happen without Mattel financing. Like it or not, everyone is still hawking a toy doll. A terrific America Ferrera as a Mattel executive with a preteen daughter (Ariana Greenblatt) who thinks Barbie is a fascist out to glorify rampant consumerism delivers a rousing speech about women fighting for equality, but the lecture seems less organic than tacked-on and self-congratulatory.

172,KMF_Doc2_Barbie,KMF_Doc2_Barbie,KMF,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"Barbie is a surprisingly profound film, more philosophical and existential than one initially would expect from a franchise rooted in plastic fashion dolls that became a cultural icon in the late 1950s. This was a period in time when young girls were in desperate need of role models, and Barbie came along as a vehicle to convey the message of independence, which is the theme of Greta Gerwig's film. Written by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, the film begins with Stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) having a perfect day in Barbie Land, her perfect pink town. She gets ready without even putting on clothes and drinks from cups with nothing in them. She doesn't eat or clean because everything is predestined to function. Barbie Land is run on female energy, and they serve in every possible working position  Supreme Court justices, doctors, scientists. Women can be anything they want to be here. Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling) and all the other Kens exist only to serve their Barbie counterparts. A Barbie beach house party filled with choreographed dancing is halted by Miss Stereotypical questioning if anyone else thinks about death. The next morning, things are way off. Barbie isn't wearing pink, the breakfast burns, milk is expired, and her pointed feet go flat  then it hits her that she's having lingering thoughts of existential dread. To find out what's going on, she has to go to the home of Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) and is told she has to enter the real world to find the girl who owns her version of the doll. There is some mental crossover that's causing Barbie to have feelings she doesn't know how to deal with. Although the mission makes her nervous, she's excited to step into a new environment because thanks to her, women rule the real world too, right? Get ready for a big slap of reality, ma'am. What Baumbach and Gerwig's script does well is give characters an ultra-awareness of their surroundings. Barbie recognizes its own surreal existence: a world where perfect plastic figures wrestle with humanistic imperfections. It acknowledges that change, even when challenging, is necessary and that perfection is an unrealistic and even undesirable goal. Issues of feminism and patriarchy are serious topics, but the writing duo managed to state their values with the right amount of levity and camp so that it doesn't distract from the film's message  which is all about finding yourself and finding balance. Robbie, in the titular role, is as remarkable as ever. Her commitment to her roles is well known, and Barbie is no exception. She imbues her character with a depth and complexity that elevates Barbie beyond the plastic persona associated with the doll. Robbie is backed by an equally talented cast including Gosling  who serves up camp so well  McKinnon, America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Will Ferrell, Emma Mackey, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Ncuti Gatwa, Alexandra Shipp and others, all of whom deliver compelling performances.

It starts with a play on 2001: A Space Odyssey, where little girls bash their baby dolls on rocks in favor of the beautiful new grown-up doll with long hair and breasts. And we're off. From there, we jump cut to Barbieland, a matriarchal society filled with Barbies of all sortsPresident Barbie and Supreme Court justice Barbie and Nobel Prize-winning Barbie. The Barbies have arched toes and feet that never touch the ground, all the better to wear stiletto heels. They don't so much move as glide through Barbieland, as though being steered by the invisible hand of a young girl. Kens are around, too, with no discernible purpose beyond competing for the attention of the Barbies. It's there that we meet Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), whose favorite Ken (Ryan Gosling)he of rock hard abs, cartoonishly blond hair, and a fondness for wearing headbands like he's a member of Cobra Kaisays his job is ""beach.""(Not lifeguard or surfer, mind you. Just beach.) We also meet ""Just Allan"" (Michael Cera), a bit scrawny compared to the Kens, who has no idea how he got there. (He is, of course, based on an actual doll. The film is nothing if not historically accurate.) Robbie, who excels at playing wide-eyed naifs, is predictably wonderful herenever losing Barbie's touching sweetness even as she learns some harsh realities about the real world. But the real secret weapon is Gosling, who leans into the over-the-top goofiness of his peacocking and dim character. It's a master class in finding truth in broad comedy. One day, after a typical ""best day ever!"" of riding her dream car, not kissing Ken (although their faces nearly touch), and frolicking with her fellow Barbies, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly blurts out: ""Do you guys ever think about death?"" Record scratch. Barbie nervously laughs it off and the party continues. The next morning, she wakes up with...bad breath! Her perfect (waterless) shower feels cold. Her (fake) waffle is burnt. And, horror of horrors, her feet are flat! She visits with a Barbie guru of sorts, ""Weird Barbie""so named because her girl cut her hair in a choppy, asymmetrical style, put her in weird clothes, painted her face like a clown, and pulled on her so hard her legs are permanently splayed. (Weird Barbie owners basically rule.) As she can no longer join the ranks of Barbieland, Weird Barbie instead dispels advice from a hill, joined by some discontinued Barbies, including pregnant Barbie, ""Midge,"" and ""Growing Up Skipper"" whosewait for itbreasts grow when you rotate her arm. (Gerwig and her writing and life partner Noah Baumbach have loads of fun with the very rich text of Barbie history. Did you know there was once a Sugar Daddy Ken?)

In Barbie Land, Barbie (Margot Robbie) and her posse (Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Alexandra Shipp) run the queendom. Her boy toy Ken (Ryan Gosling) and his clones (Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Ncuti Gatwa, John Cena) don't. The young women are proud to be presidents, astronauts and executives. Why wouldn't they? They assume their success has been witnessed by girls and ladies in the real world and that they are role models worthy of emulation. That's true, in part. However, unbeknownst to them, their impossibly trim physiques have caused females to experience body shame. Why? Because no one on earth has a figure like Barbie. With a gleam in her eye, writer/director Greta Gerwig explores the pros and cons of the doll's influence and how she and her makers (Mattel) got some things wrong and some things right. When Barbie starts having alternate thoughts and expresses weird feelings that are not in the Barbie manual, she and her followers question the meaning of life: ""You guys ever think about dying."" Say what? The feminist script makes no secret of its ambitions. Girl power or bust. The humor is chuckle-worthy but not steadily hilarious (Joy Ride). The plotline (co-writers Gerwig and Noah Baumbach), zany neon pink production design (Sarah Greenwood), campy mini-me costumes (Jacqueline Durran) and a powerhouse soundtrack (Lizzo, Tame Impala and Khalid) carry this doll world parable for 2h 42 (editor Nick Houy, Little Women). Long enough to get the point across. Long-winded enough to possibly test the patience of tweens and teens. A target audience who may not understand all they're seeing and just want to have fun. Initial song-and-dance scenes are exhilarating but run out of steam and it takes a while for Barbie's quest to identify itself and start her on the road to self-discovery. Patience is required, but there is a payoff. Robbie is a trooper, and her character has the best outcome. Gosling plays a dumb, self-absorbed airhead in a way that makes him and his delirium the most fun to watch. He and the Kens peak in a dance-off scene dressed in black clothes and loafers on a bright pink and blue dance floor with white stripes. If there is a ""Clown of the Year"" award, Gosling is a shoe-in. That or a Golden Globe for Best Actor in the Comedy or Musical category would be a just reward. America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera and Issa Rae also find the right groove. Gerwig's glee as a director is evident. Cars flipping over. Scenes that look like storybook pages. Houses with no walls. Beach body Kens who can't swim. Corporate execs who tend to the bottom line and overprotect their money-making, superstar doll. Glimpses of the real world where women kings don't rule. It's a lot to take in, and some skits work better than others.

175,KMF_Doc5_Barbie,KMF_Doc5_Barbie,KMF,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"In The Sting, a distinction is made between an everyday piddling backstreet hustle and the fabled ""big con"". This is an operation that costs a great deal of money, involves much expertise and employs many talented actors. George Roy Hill's 1973 film doesn't endorse the big con, but it admires the invention and ingenuity involved. There is nothing piddling or backstreet about Greta Gerwig's rambunctiously lurid assault on senses you didn't know you possessed. And there is certainly more to Barbie than an act of deceit. The film is much concerned with a sincere effort to interrogate the continuing frustrations of growing up female amid a still-unapologetic patriarchy. Margot Robbie, explosive throughout as the ""stereotypical"" Barbie, gets to act out some of those concerns as a self-conscious plot spins ever deeper into creative absurdity. But it is America Ferrera, playing a citizen of the real(ish) world, who connects most explicitly with the film's key concerns. Deep into the confused last act, she delivers a speech that, in remarkably clear-eyed fashion, addresses all the hypocritical paradoxes that pester girls as they pass towards womanhood. You can never do enough, but everything is your fault. You are expected not to get old, but you're not allowed to complain when you do. Arriving in a film so drenched in irony  positively drowning in the stuff  the monologue seems all the more bracing. This Barbie is definitely about something. And yet. There remains a nagging awareness that the screenplay, by the director and Noah Baumbach, is wrapping this discourse around an advertisement for a multinational toy empire that makes billions flogging girls unattainable models of femininity. Does the film address this? Naturally. Gerwig and Baumbach are among the smartest American film-makers working today. In the opening scenes we hear that ""thanks to Barbie"" all problems have been solved. You can be Dr Barbie. You can be President Barbie. It's all a bitter gag, of course. When we meet the fictional board of Mattel, the company that has manufactured the doll since 1959, we find each member a flat-faced bloke. ""I'm a man with no power. Does that make me a woman?"" one says. So it's as much an attack on Barbie as it is a celebration. Right? Well, not really. The product has been on everyone's lips for the past year. Every promotion for the film is also a promotion for the toy. That comparison with the big con is not entirely fanciful. It's also not entirely a criticism. Like the fanciest of scams, Barbie is carried off with a conviction that deserves sustained applause and occasional loud hoots. The film begins in a plastic world apparently fashioned from giant versions of Mattel's products. The swimming pool is painted over. The cars move without a noise. Just about every woman is a Barbie. Just about every man is a Ken (the most stereotypical of whom is played with bodacious idiocy by Ryan Gosling). The too-perfect world shudders when  this is not"

Barbies  and there are many Barbies  dig the roads, run the health clinics and win Nobel prizes. Each Barbie lives in her own, open-plan Dreamhouse. Every day is another perfect day. The film's director, Greta Gerwig, has compared Barbieland to a prelapsarian Paradise, a place ""with no death, no ageing, no decay, no pain, no shame"". Barbieland is not a utopia, it's a version of the United States. There's a Barbie President (Issa Rae), and a Barbie-friendly Constitution. The full bench of the Supreme Court is a set of Barbies. Visually, Barbieland is a throwback to the era of Technicolor musicals. It boasts painted backdrops and meticulous set and costume design  if Barbie doesn't win the Oscar for costume design next year, I'll eat my hat (Barbie-sized). But Gerwig is constrained by the fact that Barbie's world was only ever an idealised miniature of mid-20th-century America. Decades later and this is the nearest to an Eden that can be conceived by a Hollywood director: a very pink suburbia, ruled by the competent. For the sake of plot, some shadows must intrude. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), to give her full name, is troubled by thoughts of mortality. Her previously arched feet, which fit perfectly into her high-heeled shoes, have collapsed, causing consternation among both the Barbies and the Kens. She seeks counsel from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon, having a great time), who lays out the state of things. On the other side of Barbieland, in the real world, are humans who are playing with their Barbies. A Barbie who is played with ""too hard"" by her human, like Weird Barbie with her scribbled-on face and punk hair, starts to develop symptoms here in Barbieland. Go forth then, Barbie, and find who is hurting you. Set your world  and the human world  to rights. But first, a word on the Kens. Ah, the Kens. There are many, many Kens, including Ken number one, Stereotypical Barbie's stereotypical sidekick, played by Ryan Gosling in full himbo mode. Ken is blond, waxed and gormless; his job title is ""Beach"". He spends his Ken days diving into fake waves and posing on fake sand. Ken is a little frustrated by the fact that every night at Barbie's Dreamhouse is a girls' night in, with no place for him. Still, he lives (as much as a doll can live) for Barbie. Barbie is good: the whole point of Barbie is that she is good. She's every Good Witch and Sugar Plum Fairy melted down and poured out again into a perfect mould. But Ken is ridiculous, and the actors shine accordingly. Robbie carries the film but Gosling steals it, with a great deal of help from the script, which gives Ken all the best jokes, an extended musical number, and the most interesting character arc.

177,KMF_Doc7_Barbie,KMF_Doc7_Barbie,KMF,Comedy,Negative,Barbie,"Barbie was born in 1959  the creation of Ruth Handler, who was one of the founders of the furniture company turned toy manufacturer that became the Mattel empire. Handler, or so the story goes, noticed that her child Barbara liked to imagine grown-up lives for her paper dolls instead of treating them like babies to mother. The doll Handler proposed, and which she named after her daughter, was aspirational, a vision of the future (albeit one with anatomically impossible proportions). The first Barbie may have been a statuesque model in a bathing suit, but subsequent versions would be chefs, pediatricians, beekeepers, flight attendants, soccer players, astronauts, and, yes, presidents. Barbie gives the wildly popular doll her most challenging role yet: that of a big-screen protagonist played by producer and star Margot Robbie, who finds herself in the midst of a surreal existential crisis. Director Greta Gerwig has tended to talk about her film in spiritual terms, citing the Apostles' Creed and the creation myth in Genesis. By that measure, Handler is the closest thing that the ultrapink realm of Barbie Land has to a God. There's another facet of the Barbie origin tale, which is that Handler came across a doll called Bild Lilli while in Europe and ripped it off, settling with the German company responsible for the toy after they sued. Barbie may be a pop-culture icon and an emblem for the inconsistent impulses stuffed into the concept of female empowerment, but more than anything else, hers is a story about money, and it's impossible to separate what she means for women from her existence as a business proposition. To be fair, Gerwig's Barbie doesn't try to, or at least it incorporates a bumbling all-male Mattel C-suite led by Will Ferrell into its world-hopping adventures. The suits try to corral Barbie after she makes her way to the real world with her platinum-blond Ken (Ryan Gosling) in tow, but they're only one of the obstacles she has to contend with. Others include persistent thoughts of death, the abrupt intrusion of cellulite into a previously PVC-smooth existence, scathing critiques of her brand from Gen-Zers, and sexism. Safe to say that the film, which has an all-Ken fantasy dance number, an ad for a sweatpants-wearing Depression Barbie, and America Ferrera as a Mattel employee named Gloria delivering a variation of the ""cool girl"" monologue from Gone Girl, is much weirder than you'd ever expect a Barbie motion picture to be. It's just not enough. There's a streak of defensiveness to Barbie, as though it's trying to anticipate and acknowledge any critiques lodged against it before they're made. The impulse to grade Barbie on a curve because it's based on a toy line, or to focus on what it was able to get away with under the auspices of a corporate brand, feels unfair to Gerwig, whose debut, Lady Bird, and ebullient take on Louisa May Alcott's most famous work earned her a place as one of the country's most"
178,KMF_Doc8_Barbie,KMF_Doc8_Barbie,KMF,Comedy,Negative,Barbie,"The packaging of ""Barbie"" is a lot more fun than the tedious toy inside the box. Ingeniously, a yearlong barrage of Mattel propaganda was foisted upon us and created a resistance-is-futile Summer of Barbie before anybody knew if the movie was any good. There were pop-up cafes, a Forever 21 clothing collaboration and viral Instagram filters galore. And then the actual film arrived. To almost quote the Aqua song: Life in plastic  not fantastic. ""Barbie"" is an exhausting, spastic, self-absorbed and overwrought disappointment. Arthouse director/co-writer Greta Gerwig (the superb ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"") and co-writer Noah Baumbach (""Marriage Story"") have churned out a smug tale that doesn't boast a single sympathetic character. It does, however, have plenty of moral platitudes and pinky-out intellectual jokes. Midway through this corporate cash grab masquerading as an art installation, a teenage girl shouts at Margot Robbie's Barbie in a California high school cafeteria: ""You represent everything wrong with our culture. You destroyed the planet with your glorification of rampant consumerism  you fascist!"" Barbie, not used to being criticized, cries, ""She thinks I'm a fascist?! I don't control the railways or the flow of commerce!"" That eye-roll-worthy interaction neatly encapsulates the entire enterprise's high-on-its-own-supply sense of humor that always comes at the expense of character and plot development and turns off anybody who's trying to have a good time. Worse, the spat underlines the filmmakers' delusion that this ""Barbie"" is something more than just another ploy to sell merchandise. Gerwig's movie starts with a cliche. A narrator (Helen Mirren) says, ""Since the beginning of time, there have always been dolls,"" as a group of little girls surround a giant Barbie and violently smash their old toys to smithereens. It's sending up the monolith scene from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that has been parodied forever. Mirren then goes on to tell us of a utopia called Barbie Land, where a diverse array of Barbies and Kens inhabit a matriarchal society in which a Barbie is president (Issa Rae) and the Supreme Court is made up entirely of Barbies. They all live in Malibu DreamHouses, go to the cardboard beach, innocently flirt with Kens and dance at slumber parties. If you're hoping to experience a multiverse of unique, strong-personality Barbies, you're better off going to Toys ""R"" Us after a few martinis. Played by Hari Nef, Dua Lipa, Nicola Coughlan and Emma Mackey, among others, the group members all act similarly and are frustratingly interchangeable with few standout moments. Every Ken (Ryan Gosling, Scott Evans, Simu Liu and more) is, predictably, a moron. The narrator adds that Barbie Land citizens believe that, ""thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved"" out in the real world. Each Barbie, you see, has a plastic toy stand-in on Earth. For instance, Kate McKinnon's Barbie (one of the few bright spots) has hacked-off hair and colored lines on her face because a little girl ""played too hard"" and tossed her in a box."

However, the idea has finally come to pass, bringing with it some remarkably unexpected talent in the form of three-time Oscar nominee Greta Gerwig as director/co-writer, as well as three-time Oscar nominee Noah Baumbach as her fellow co-writer. It's certainly a tall order to deliver a movie based on a toy doll that will appeal to viewers of all ages, one that any filmmaker would find daunting, but these two have put their heads together and given it their best shot, and the result is a curious one, to say the least. The film opens in ""Barbieland,"" where we find Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) living her normal, everyday life among all the various types of Barbies and Kens. Her particular Ken (Ryan Gosling) is trying to get her attention as always, but never seems to get very far, with Barbie preferring to spend time with the other Barbies. One day, Barbie finds herself occupied with thoughts of death, on top of having flat feet and cellulite, causing her to visit ""Weird"" Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a deformed outcast who was played too hard with in the real world. She informs Barbie that she must visit this real world in order to find who's playing with her and to fix her problems. She sets off to do so, unexpectedly joined by Ken, starting them on a journey that will change everything. As mentioned, trying to make a live-action Barbie movie presents a number of challenges for any filmmaker, with perhaps the most primary of those being the simple question: What does that world even look like? Well, as an answer, Gerwig and co. dove into decades of material to give Barbieland the very plastic-looking aesthetic that you'd expect from a world of dolls, complete with dream homes (all in pink, naturally), various iterations of both Barbie and Ken, and, of course, a multitude of flashy outfits. The production design may seem a tad gaudy and over-the-top, but would you expect anything less for a project as peculiar as this? Another one of those challenges comes in the portrayal of the leads, an intriguing challenge that both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (both multiple Oscar nominees as well) were up to. Robbie and Gosling give their respective dolls just the right touch of naivete, which transforms as their characters go along on their journey, a journey that does indeed cause some big changes within both of them. Leave it to talented actors like this to breathe life into characters that most know simply as emotionless, inanimate toys. The look and the performances are one thing, but what ends up being the single biggest challenge of all is how to put it all together into a compelling storyline that will entertain and delight audiences, without"

This argument is successfully made in the opening couple of scenes and then repeated for the remainder of the film's 114 minutes. There is really just one joke, varied slightly throughout. Some of those variations are funnyKen's confusion over the masculine place of horses in the world outside the matriarchal Barbieland, the way women must endure the mansplaining of The Godfatherbut even the good gags are buried by the drumbeat of repetition. The film is the phenomenon of the summer of 2023, which frankly needed a good phenomenon, and as such things go, I'm fine with it. It assumes its audience is smart (but still in need of the occasional lecture), it's on the right side of history, it will almost certainly build a better-informed citizenry. People are apparently seeing it more than once, maybe for the feeling of being part of a happening, maybe for the arch songs and garish colors and inside jokes about Barbie lore. I can't imagine seeing it a second time, because everything is right there on the surface (except for the Mattel Easter eggs, I guess), easy to grasp and easy enough to enjoy. And that's it. Yes, Ryan Gosling's Ken has many throwaway pouts to savor, but beyond that there isn't much to get. Take Allan, a sidekick doll to Ken, played by Michael Cera. In the film's pre-release publicity, the photographs of Cerahilariously decked out in loud and sexually ambiguous beachwearsuggested a high point in the movie itself, especially with this inventive actor. But then you watch Barbie, and there's Allan and his beachwear, and although he pops up a handful of times in the action (as though somebody realized we've got to get Allan involved somewhere, which I guess is very Allan), that's the extent of it. This is moviemaking, circa 2023, and the movie's success suggests there is no fighting it. Believe me, I am aware of my wet-blanketness when I ask if this is really all there is to Barbie, especially when there are Tik Tok commentators who are so much more upbeat about the movie, and about every movie, apparently. Anyway. I have found Greta Gerwig's work as a director to contain legitimately wonderful things, and will make just a couple of observations here about directing style before standing aside and allowing the zeitgeist to roll over me. Gerwig's method of composing (the film is shot by Rodrigo Prieto) has a few notable strategies; for instance, proscenium-like compositions that approximate looking at a toy diorama such as Barbie's Dreamhouse, thus placing the film in the unlikely tradition of Jerry Lewis's The Ladies Man and Jean-Luc Godard's Tout va bien. In Barbie, this visual style extends beyond the depiction of these cut-away sets; so, for instance, the scenes in which Margot Robbie's doll passes between Barbieland"

You think it's gonna be a mindless Tom Cruise action flick but it really becomes a Sci-Fi Noir level complex murder mystery plot. There isn't that much action in this actually outside of like 2-3 scenes which are all really well done. The special effects do hold really good too suprisngly. The sonic shotgun was freakin awesome. Lots of CGI but also lots of practical sets too with the green screen scenes to balance it out. While this has that grey dull metallic look of lots of 00's Sci-Fi it never feels generic or dull. Part of that is Speilbergs direction. But also the lighting making things so blurred and bright to offset it gives the whole film an almost dreamlike feel to the whole thing. It makes it very memorable overall and it did grow on me. I haven't really seen that done before in a Sci-Fi flick. This is filled with lots of commentary about the Future, Big Brother, and how life changing technology can be changed from good to bad depending on whose hands it falls into. It also has a really great twist to it as well. I did kind of see it coming but it was still great the way it was done leading up to when John kills the guy. It's a really powerful moment how you can change the future. This is built on the backs of the greats like Terminator 2, Blade Runner, and the Fifth Element style wise. As great as everything is I do have minor gripes. First even though I get the twist and the villian is really good, I still have trouble understanding his motives that were explained. It just gets sort of hard to follow and I'm not fully sure I understand it but I get the general idea. Second, a couple of plot holes like why when John scans his eye do they not have the system alarms in place for that, why would he let a guy he put away operate on him, why would the guy actually help him too like he did, why did the precog say run when it was too late? It's minor though and I can overlook. also, the product placements at times especially in the mall are distracting. Finally, the soundtrack is great and it feels like a Spielberg movie type score but it sounds like all the previous ones even though it's used great and I liked it. It reminded me of other movies rather than giving this one something entirely unique. Everything is still really good and I wanted to give the 5 ranking but the more I thought about ti the more little minor holes kept popping up. This has that more serious style and tone that later Speilberg movies would have but it also has the charm and some humor of his 80's-90's work still. Anyone who is a fan"

This film marks the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. The film has audiences asking some important questions. What if we knew what was going to happen in the future? After you ask yourself the question, what if the person knowing this found out he was going to kill someone? This is the gist of the film, which is based on the Philip K. Dick short story. Another thing here is that the audience must be able to buy into the science early on in the film. This is key to being able to just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you're watching the film for the first time in 2020, the science is very believable. It's amazing how much of the science is catching up right in front of us. There's something to be said about the eye-dentification. Social media platforms already know our faces. Companies target us online because of internet cookies. One could look at author Philip K. Dick as a prophet in the world of science-fiction. In case you didn't know, Dick is also the man behind Blade Runner. One of the film's main themes is free will vs. determinism. The film handles this so beautifully. If we know our future, could we possibly do something to change it? The Department of PreCrime, at least in what we see on screen, is mostly focusing on preventing murders. This is where the three pre-cognitives are the main focus. Two twin males and one female share a common trait. They see the future and the visions appear on a giant screen. Together, they're able to see the future. They have no interaction with the outside world. The department's agents work to arrest people on the basis of the visions. PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has turned to drugs since his son, Sean, disappeared. Anderton is also separated from his wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris). Anderton just happens to have the unfortunate luck of being in the pre-cogs vision when DOJ agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is visiting the agency. Talk about bad luck! Anderton now goes on the run and PreCrime creator Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) tells him that Agatha (Samantha Morton) sometimes has a different vision. Dr. Hineman refers to this as a ""minority report."" There's a lot of mystery in the film surrounding the death of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper). She just happens to be Agatha's mother. The further we get into the film, Anderton learns that he's being framed. Meanwhile, Witwer starts studying the available footage and starts to believe the same. Anybody in the right mind would do what he does next. But what Witwer doesn't know is that the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), is covering up the murder. Goodbye Witwer! In many aspects, Minority Report falls under the usual"

The less said about the woeful ""Vanilla Sky"" the better, but in both cases they proved quite different films for Spielberg and Cruise respectively. Now the pair have teamed up for this more straightforward and grittier sci-fi Fugitive-style thriller which, while not deserving the ""best since Raiders"" calls being made about it, nevertheless proves a quite engaging blockbuster which puts both back toward the path of the kind of material that made them the stars they are today. Cruise delivers his usual style of solid performance which is thankfully backed by some decent material this time. He's an actor you can immediately believe in the role as a guy with both the physical and mental stamina to stay on the run  and although there's some over the top moments (including one bit where he channels his Vanilla Sky Elephant Man performance), for the most part he's effortlessly watchable. Colin Farrell, who looks like he's impersonating a young brunette Brad Pitt in this, has sheer charisma and spunk which helps overcome a rather flat character that is sort of the film's bad guy in that he's out for himself rather than Cruise (if only he weren't so damn selfish). Stormare does one of his best roles in ages as a rather over the top buffoonish eye removal surgeon, on the opposite end of the scale Von Sydow is quite disappointing as the 'father of Pre-Crime'  so much so the one scene with Lois Smith (the 'mother of Pre-Crime') in a greenhouse proves one of the film's rather quirky highlights. Samantha Morton is the showstealer though as the Pre-Cog Agatha, an emotionally charged role which pushes her hard and she lives up to each moment. The FX are quite impressive, my favourite easily being the gratuitous use of a huge variety of vertical and oddly angled highways which cars zoom out and through in such a frenzy that one action sequence spent with them (seen in the trailers where Cruise leaps from car to car) is breathtaking. Throughout this future there's all sorts of nifty ""Total Recall"" esque gadgets including a sick stick (ably demonstrated in one scene), jetpacks, retinal scans everywhere, omni-present advertising, holographic pleasure rooms  none of this is particularly new ideas of the future but the design of each is quite spiffy and adds to the film's whole atmosphere. Indeed, much like ""Spider-Man"" earlier this Summer, its the opening act which sets up what pre-Crime is and the initial stages of his 'running' that are easily the film's strongest moments. The opening 20 minutes devoted to showing off Pre-Crime in action is quite tense and compelling  a well constructed and executed sequence overall that's easy to understand and establishes the intriguing concept well. However its a little bit downhill from there with most notably the use of handcam in the warehouse shootout proving so"
184,LFN_Doc4_Minority_Report,LFN_Doc4_Minority_Report,LFN,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"As a director, Steven Spielberg owns one of the greatest track records of his generation. I think the secret of Spielberg's success is that, unlike many other currently prominent directors, he is more able to balance the high-tech, effects-driven aspects of his movies with the much more important human factor. Although many of his most popular films have been effects extravaganzas like E.T., Close Encounters, and Jurassic Park, some of his best films are the ones where effects take a back seat to character and relationship work; i.e., Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan. Although Spielberg's latest effort, Minority Report, is admittedly one of his more emotionally sterile productions, it is not unlike last year's A.I. in that it features a fascinating, futuristic concept (based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, first published in Fantastic Universe magazine in 1956), with just enough of the human touch to make it emotionally accessible to the audience. While we may marvel at the ideas of crimes being predicted by psychic clairvoyants, or cars that glide effortlessly and automatically down the sides of skyscrapers and merge onto the highway with nary an accident, or advertisements that speak to you by name after having read your retinal scan, the issue more resonant to us is the man who has lost his little boy, and it is this issue that drives the film. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have reliable actors like Tom Cruise and Max von Sydow, not to mention a huge and uniformly capable supporting cast, and writers like Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, who adapted Dick's 50-year-old story for a current audience, or the tense and powerful music of Spielberg's longtime friend and composer, John Williams, to help with the overall effect. The story is set in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054. The city's law enforcement authorities have begun an experimental procedure for which they hope to seek acceptance (and funding) on a national level, called the PreCrime agency. Devised by retired law enforcement officer and elder statesman Lamar Burgess (von Sydow), the system uses the talents of three people with exceptional psychic abilities who are kept in a constant state of dream sleep by a combination of mind-numbing drugs, partial immersion in a huge sensory-deprivation tank, and electronic ""halos"" attached to their heads (which basically give them the Jack Nicholson treatment from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest). Using the fragmented images seen by these ""precognitives,"" which are projected onto a screen and interpreted by agents like Detective John Anderton (Cruise), the agency is able to predict and prevent every murder that is about to happen in the city, deftly stepping in and arresting the suspect before the crime has even been committed and fitting him with his own halo so he can enjoy the paralytic state that will keep him quiet while he rots in suspended-animation prison. Boasting a spotless record over the past several years, the PreCrime agency has made Washington the safest city in the"

""Star Trek"" was famously pitched as ""'Wagon Train' to the stars"" and ""Star Wars"" is a fairytale, complete with a Princess. Like ""Bladerunner"", to which this film owes a lot, Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" is a mystery couched in a futuristic backdrop. At its heart, it is a standard ""hero gets framed"" story. The story, however, is told in one of the most complete and realistic future-scapes ever filmed. Starting with a fantastic premise from reliable sci-fi auteur Philip K. Dick (""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" - upon which ""Bladerunner"" was based), in the future, using pre-cognitive humans, we are able to stop crime before it happens, the script by Scott Frank (""Out of Sight"") and Jon Cohen hits all the points it needs to. There are a few things you can expect from any time-travel or prognostication story: at some point someone will have to make a choice that either (a) changes the future or (b) winds up coming to the same conclusion that had already been foretold. It's been done before in everything from ""Back to the Future"" to ""12 Monkeys"" to countless ""Star Trek"" and ""X-files"" episodes. The moral questions of predetermination, destiny and choice are given close examination throughout the film, there are plot twists, red herrings and backstory galore. The complex inner-workings of ""precrime"" and its history are realistically imagined and presented in a way that is surprisingly easy to understand to even the most uninitiated audience. Mr. Spielberg and his team have certainly done their research: advances in advertising, urban planning, police work, computers, video screens, artificial intelligence, identity scanning, and a plethora of other tidbits are squeezed into the film's two-hour-plus running time. Of course, though set only 52 years in the future, certain advances seem far ahead of others. While clothing hasn't changed much at all (a welcome difference from most other unitard-laden sci-fi efforts), the Washington DC highway system seems to have been completely re-imagined. Honestly, the DC highway commission better get to work right now if they want to hit a 2054 delivery date. It is exciting to watch a director who is in such complete control of storytelling and vision. Yes, there are moments of the Spielbergian schmaltz that we've come to expect from this director. Thankfully, however, nothing so egregious as the last twenty minutes that nearly destroyed ""A.I."" The moments in ""Minority Report"" work because they are more true to the story and the characters. Without Stanley Kubrick's shadow over his shoulder, Mr. Spielberg can be influenced without being steered by the late director, as he was in ""A.I."" The future depicted in this film is more grounded in the reality in which Spielberg is comfortable and as such, it lends itself to acceptable moments of tearjerking or cutesy mugging from its cast. That cast, by the way, is in top form across the"
186,LFN_Doc6_Minority_Report,LFN_Doc6_Minority_Report,LFN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"I saw someone praising Minority Report on social media, and was reminded how much I hate it. So I thought I'd re-up this piece from my old blog. It's 11 years old, but still accurate. _______ After watching Minority Report last night, I was surprised to discover that most critics do not consider it to be an utter and complete piece of crap. Roger Ebert, in particular, had an absolutely gushing review, in which he praised the film for being ""a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit."" Subscribe Ebert is by all accounts a lovely human being, but every time I read something by him, I am reminded that he does not have the critical sense that God gave a roach. Even an insect that frolics in filth would be hard pressed to find any enjoyment in such a shiny, treacly, turkey of a film. Spielberg as director has found perhaps the perfect outlet for his glibness in this tale of precognitive saviors. The film grinds frictionlessly along, a remorselessly predictable blueprint for itself. Flawed hero, tragic backstory, clever chase scene, cleverer chase scene, cleverest chase scene, false antagonist, twist, real antagonist, reconciliation with perfectly domestic yet also spunky wife. Like the precogs, we can see it all coming and all going too; painful echoes of sentiment past sliding down our brainstems as we float weightlessly in an infinite vat of sentimental horseshit. The emotional core of the film is (you could predict it) the tragic backstory I mentioned. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a efficient no-nonsense police guy in the precrime unit, snooping out murders before they happen. Beneath his gruff exterior and Hollywood good looks, though, lurks a sadness; his 5-year old disappeared from a public pool. Anderton's marriage collapsed, and now he takes drugs (ooooh...dark) and watches 3-D home movies of his son and wife. His heart is tugged while watching them and our heart is tugged while watching him; it's a testament to the power of film and to ""complex human feelings"", in Ebert's words. Said complex human feelings being: hey, losing a kid  that really sucks. If that happens to you, you've got to be deep, right? That is the extent of the film's character development; Anderton has no other discernible personality traits; nor does his wife. The film's stupid, by-the-numbers plot, it's utterly facile and familiar characters, are all supposed to be redeemed by dropping a murdered five-year old onto them from a great height. Before I had a kid myself, I found this sort of mindless, self-serving manipulation unpleasant. Now that I have a child of my own, who is actually a person rather than a trope, I find it even more detestable. At the end of the film, Anderton indignantly yells at his stupid standard-issue corrupt boss for manipulating his love for his child. Rarely have I seen a moment of such utterly clueless hypocrisy. The whole film is nothing but a giant machine"
187,LFN_Doc7_Minority_Report,LFN_Doc7_Minority_Report,LFN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Once again this year we are graced with a futuristic sci-fi flick based on a short story by the visionary Philip Dick, this time in the form of ""Minority Report"", which poses the intriguing hypothesis: What if we could see into the future and arrest people before they commit a murder, or any other crime for that matter? Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as ""Pre-Cogs"" who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are ""set"" to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this ""perfect"" system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let's face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he's innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Minority Report"" reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg's last futuristic foray, ""A.I."", a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski's artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning  those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect. Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise's energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha's Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha  tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (""Dune"", ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Exorcist"") steps in as Anderton's superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protege Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who"
188,LFN_Doc8_Minority_Report,LFN_Doc8_Minority_Report,LFN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Set in the year 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report looks clammy and bleached-out. The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter. There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be"
189,LFN_Doc9_Minority_Report,LFN_Doc9_Minority_Report,LFN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"In Minority Report, a futuristic thriller set in 2054, murder has been eliminated in Washington DC thanks to a division of law enforcement known as Precrime. Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers. Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities. Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future. As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!"" Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication"

Dick, ""Minority Report"" marks the second futuristic, science-fiction epic Steven Spielberg has made in as many years (after what I believe to be his greatest achievement, ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence""). For Spielberg, undeniably one of the most influential and visionary filmmakers of his time, the film almost seems tailor-made for his marvelous visual sense and stunning talent for storytelling. For all of its sweeping technical flourishes and seamless visual effects, however, ""Minority Report"" is as shallow and characteristically vacant as ""A.I."" was emotionally resonating and creatively groundbreaking. In other words, though it pains me to conclude, Steven Spielberg's latest opus is one of the weakest films he has made, to date. Set in a surprisingly realistic vision of what Washington, D.C. might look like in 2054, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the top detective on the police force's relatively new Pre-Crime Unit. Through three pre-cog oracles whose minds hold the key to the future, the Pre-Crime Force, headed by Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is able to stop predestined murders before they occur. The alleged success of the program has cut down on major crimes in D.C. by ninety percent. When the latest murder suspect name comes up, Anderton is dismayed to learn that it is his own. Without never having met the victim before, Anderton is convinced that someonepossibly federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), who is after his jobis trying to ruthlessly set him up. With the police suddenly after him, Anderton has no choice but to go on the run. Breaking into the Pre-Crime building, he kidnaps the most talented of the three pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), convinced that what she knows about his future is the key to clearing his name and saving his life. The general premise of ""Minority Report"" is a novel one, fascinating in the way the world has developed enough in fifty years that the police force has begun acting, more or less, as God to citizens. The moral implications of such a debatewhether a person's future is predestined or capable of changeare thought-provoking, to be sure, but get lost in a screenplay (credited to Scott Frank and Jon Cohen) more interested in action set-pieces, and a film that chooses style over any form of hard-edged substance. While several of the action scenes are astonishingly executed, including a death-defying jump across cars hovering in the air, and a search for John by electronic spiders sent to check the retinas of an apartment complex's tenants, what surrounds them is a thoroughly unsatisfying emptiness posing as a study of serious-minded issues. Whatever deep-rooted involvement one might have grown to have in John Anderton's dire predicament proves sterile in a sea of blank faces posing as characters. Precious little is ever learned about John, except that he blames himself for his son's kidnapping six years ago, is separated from his wife (Kathryn Morris), and has a secret drug problem, and even fewer reasons are given for why we"

The film marks the English language debut of Spanish writer-director, Alejandro Amenabar, already a Hollywood darling thanks to his previous effort, Open Your Eyes - which has been remade as the forthcoming Cameron Crowe/Tom Cruise collaboration, Vanilla Sky. What you will get with The Others, however, are some of the creepiest, most atmospheric chills to permeate a cinema screen for years - for by choosing the unseen over the blatant, swapping graphic violence and gruesome murder for self-closing doors and self-playing pianos, and spilling not a single drop of blood along the way, Amenabar has created a haunting, imaginative shocker which is likely to rattle around in your brain for days after. Kidman is superbly cast here, nailing the plummy English accent to perfection, as the repressed young woman who is forced to keep her photo-sensitive kids (Mann and Bentley) in a world where the curtains stay drawn. It's the appearance of the new servants (including - yes!! - Eric Sykes) that serves as the catalyst for things to begin happening. And while you know that most of these are going to revolve around Kidman's desire to shield her children from the dangers of daylight and the peculiar list of rules she has imposed upon the household (permanently closed doors which suddenly develop a life of their own, forever-drawn curtains which mysteriously vanish overnight), that doesn't make them any less effective when they do. While all of this might sound on paper like bog-standard haunted house theatrics (and anybody who saw The Haunting might well dread the thought of that), Amenebar's film is far cleverer. The director's decision to opt for a slow ratcheting-up of tension is a wise one, given that it lends further credence to the scariest bits and instils a sense of dread and confusion in the audience during the film's quieter moments - the ones that serve to remind you that you never know exactly what's lurking round the next corner. The small but strong cast display just the right level of creepiness, and the two child stars are a real find. Mann and Bentley do fall victim to the occasional bit of English whimsy, which makes the film feel rather too much like a BBC1 Sunday afternoon teatime drama, but for the most part they manage to be as unsettling as everybody else. Ultimately though, it's Kidman who takes centre stage - and the big question now, of course, is whether her inevitable Oscar nomination will be for her role in Moulin Rouge, or for this, as the mother driven to distraction, consumed by over-protective love for her children, yet at the same time unable to comprehend the downfall of her safe haven. In a way, The Others finishes what The Blair Witch Project started - once again reminding us that unseen forces often make for the"

Something . . . diabolic!"" You would be right about the dialogue. This is a haunted house movie, dark and atmospheric, but it's quiet and brooding. It has less in common with, say, ""The House on Haunted Hill"" than with ""The Sixth Sense"" or a story by Oliver Onions. It's not a freak show but a waiting game, in which an atmosphere of dread slowly envelops the characterstoo slowly. Comparing this movie with ""The Sixth Sense,"" we feel a renewed admiration for the way M. Night Shyamalan was able to maintain tension through little things that were happening, instead of (this film's strategy) big things that seem about to happen. The film takes place in an isolated manor on the island of Jersey, off the British coast. In this house lives Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, the tremulous Nicholas (James Bentley) and the cheeky Anne (Alakina Mann). To the house one day come three servants, who are responding, or say they are responding, to Grace's advertisement for domestic help. There are vacancies because the previous servants decamped in the middle of the night without a word of notice. The three new applicants have the advantage of being familiar with the house. It is a sound tradition of British fiction that servants do not leave a house only to later return and be rehired (the sole exception is George Wellbeloved, Lord Emsworth's pig-keeper at Blandings Castle). But these are the days immediately after World War II, which claimed, or seems to have claimed, Grace's husband in battle, and so perhaps help is hard to find. She hires them: Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), the middle-aged Irish woman with the know-it-all nods, the young mute girl Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and the gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), who is so ancient that for him planting a seed is an act of wild optimism. There are odd rules in the house. Each of the 50 doors must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. These measures are necessary, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it. The film's events are such that I must not describe them. Even a hint might give away the game. Of course they are elusive and mysterious, reported by some, not seen by others, explained first one way and then another. By the time we arrive at the line ""there's something in this house!"" we are not only prepared to agree, but to suspect that in supernatural terms, it's as crowded as the Smithsonian's attic. The director, Alejandro Amenabar, has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere,"
193,PGP_Doc3_TheOthers,PGP_Doc3_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Positive,TheOthers,"Sumptuously crafted, with moody eeriness and almost surreal visual imagery, Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar's The Others is a terrific supernatural thriller that builds and sustains its considerable suspense, without ever relying on violence or special effects. Cast in a role she was born to play, Nicole Kidman stars as a neurotic single mom, raising two seemingly problematic children while her husband is fighting in WWII. Though effectively scary, and thematically recalling the blockbuster The Sixth Sense, The Others is an arthouse film, a status recently confirmed by its inclusion in the Venice Film Festival's main competition. Avid devotees of the occult film are the primary target audience, but, with the right marketing, and strong critical support, Miramax can score decent numbers in major urban centers, with an English-speaking tale that still feels like a foreign film. Showing a special talent for reality-bending thrillers, Amenabar has earlier made the equally impressive thriller, Open Your Eyes, which was adapted as Cameron Crowe's new film project, Vanilla Sky, starring Tom Cruise, here credited as exec producer with his partner, Paula Wagner. Like all good psychological thrillers, The Others deals with the most primal human fears, such as fear of being isolated in a secluded house, fear of somber closets, fear of half-open doors. In this particular case, scripter Amenabar works up a nice twist, building his suspenser not around fear of the dark, a common element of the genre, but rather fear of the light. Set on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of WWII, tale revolves around Grace, an attractive if severe woman who's anxiously waiting for her beloved husband to return from the front so that her family can resume a more normal life. A domineering mother, Grace overprotects her two children who, she claims, can never be exposed to any light. The house is always dark, with curtains covering ever inch of the big, menacing windows. As the story begins, three new servants appear at Grace's door, as replacement to the former helpers, who had inexplicably disappeared one night. Tension mounts as soon as Grace realizes that the servants have arrived, even though she has not had a chance to mail her request for help to the personal ads section of the local press. Who are they Gradually, it's revealed that each member of the enigmatic trio is familiar with the house, its surrounding cemetery, and bizarre history that's recorded in hidden photo albums. Every once in a while, the children scream out of frightening sights, holding that the house is populated by intruders. When her daughter first reveals that she has been communicating with unexplained apparitions, Grace is reluctant to believe her, because it defies her devout Christian upbringing. Instead of consoling her children, Grace keeps punishing them with the kind of severe intensity that will increase the fears of normal children, let alone problematic ones. All the relationships get even more perplex and complicated, when Grace's husband (Eccleston) suddenly returns home from the War and"
194,PGP_Doc4_TheOthers,PGP_Doc4_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Positive,TheOthers,"In a post-Sixth Sense world, The Others' ending is as spell-binding as M. Night Shyamalan's classic. It's not easy to essentially take Plato's Allegory of the Cave and revamp it into a psychological horror-thriller, but the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenabar (Abre Los Ojos) paid off in its creative risks and twist finale that left jaws on the floor. Much like The Sixth Sense, though, the reveal was relatively easy to spot. The story of a woman (Nicole Kidman) and her two children living in a spooky Victorian mansion was riddled with metaphorical clues that led audiences down a bread crumb-laden trail. Even if you were clever enough to spot them at the time, they didn't devalue the journey, which speaks to Amenabar's sensibilities and complete control over the film he directed and wrote. Valuing old-school cinematic techniques and vintage horror films, he was more interested in building up to the big twist, rather than the big twist, itself. As the film's finale still proves to be a pillar of the horror genre, we're diving deep into The Others and why its ending is still enticing for today's audiences. M. Night Shyamalan changed the horror landscape when he unleashed his ghost story starring a little Haley Joel Osmont as a child who sees dead people. Audiences went bonkers over the shocking twist ending, and filmmakers took note. Amenabar, who directed, wrote and composed the music for The Others, knew this. He said in interviews (like this one, with Pop Matters) that he wanted to make a film that didn't rely so heavily on theatrical special effects, and instead went down a path that focused on character, played with silences, and bathed in metaphor. The effort paid off handsomely, as The Others is one of his best and most celebrated works. The Others' ending, in turn, has arguably become one of the greatest additions to the horror genre, and one that raised the bar for the others (pun intended) moving forward. All throughout The Others, Grace and her children have been plagued by sounds, which progress to frightening supernatural occurrences, and even possession. We come to know Grace as a devoutly religious woman who constantly preaches to her children about what happens to little kids who turn their backs on Christ. She chooses not to believe in phantoms, but soon, these spirits become harder and harder to ignore. In the final moments of the film, Grace discovers that her three household staffers are also ghosts. After an encounter in the woods, her children run up to their bedroom to go and hide, only to be taken inside by the ghostly ""intruders."" Grace bravely walks up the stairs to confront these spirits, and save her children from their clutches. When she opens the door, she sees a round table at which are seated three of the beings her children have seen around the house  a mother, a father, an old woman  and a fourth. The old woman, her eyes as"
195,PGP_Doc5_TheOthers,PGP_Doc5_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Positive,TheOthers,"The Others is an exceedingly well-crafted ghost story that builds its suspense in the mind of the viewer. We are not given a series of shocks or frightening effects (i.e., ever-present voices, multiple grotesque images, etc.) as is done too often in movies like this. That's not to say that those elements aren't present, but when they do appear, the scare is genuine because it has built from a psychological origin. This is an old-fashioned yarn drenched in atmosphere that seems more like Henry James' novel Turn of the Screw than the recent The Haunting or the insipid House on Haunted Hill. It's a film that takes its time and never loses its intrigue. In Jersey soon after World War II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives alone with her two children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) in an old house after her husband disappeared during the war. Three strangers come upon the house looking for work, and we soon learn that the previous servants just suddenly disappeared one day into thin air. Grace has a few rules for the new workers, the most important being that before one door in the house is opened, the other must be closed and locked. The reason for this is that her children are photosensitivehighly allergic to light. The children are forced to live in the house and are taught and raised by their mother with a strict, religious hand. The house, however, seems to hold a presence that defies Grace's convictions, and as curtains open, doors shut, and heavy footsteps echo through the halls, Grace is forced to consider the possibility that there is either a presence beyond those living in the house, that she is losing her mind, or that there are other forces at work impressing either of these guises upon her. Like the best films about haunted buildings, the house itself becomes as important to the story as any of the other characters. This is a large and imposing edifice, sitting in the middle of a fog-filled environment. While the children's photosensitivity gives Grace motivation, it also is a great gimmick to keep the house dark and gloomy. There is also an interesting decision in the placement of fixtures in the house. These kinds of movies are often opportunities for art directors to show off, but here, designer Benjamin Fernandez has made the house essentially barren. It has the period look and the few objects that are placed within add to the setting, but by stripping the house of furnishings and decoration, it adds to the desolate atmosphere. This is somewhat of a risky decision because we have grown accustomed to the grand haunted house, but this plain arrangement works just as well, if not better. The story itself is essentially the stuff of all ghost stories. The exposition is slow but precise and always intriguing. As the suspicion and tension mount, the film starts throwing in little twists. Yet what is best about the story is that"
196,PGP_Doc6_TheOthers,PGP_Doc6_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Negative,TheOthers,"The Others starts auspiciously enough with a blood-curdling scream by its star, Nicole Kidman. Unfortunately, this the most interesting thing that happens for the next 45 minutes. Spanish writer/director Alejandro Amenabar, who helmed the film, definitely does not fall into the trap of overstating the horror in his horror film (I have often complained that scary movies undermine their own effectiveness by overdoing their effects), but he almost goes too far in the opposite direction, keeping the action at a slow, plodding pace that provokes more yawns than gasps from his audience. Kidman, who is onscreen during practically every scene, is suitably affected, but one can only witness so many minutes of wandering tensely around a darkened mansion looking for ghosts before one thinks, ""Okay, show me something scary, or I'm going to go watch Rush Hour 2 again."" The final reel of The Others is reasonably captivating, but the 85 minutes that come before it are mostly just dull and atmospheric. Kidman's character, Grace, is a mother of two who is still waiting in her huge and unneccessarily scary house in the Channel Islands for the return of her husband from World War II. The trouble is, it's fall 1945, the war ended several months ago, and she still hasn't heard a word. (My theory is he's too scared to come back to the house.) Anyway, while she waits for him, she has other problems. Her children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), suffer from an allergy to light which makes it neccessary to keep the curtains closed at all times lest they break out in hives, and her entire staff of servants has recently tendered their resignation, no doubt because Grace has been grumpy lately for lack of sex. While Grace alternates between catching up on her embroidery and psychologically torturing her kids with scary Bible lessons, her new staff of three begins to learn the rules of the house. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), whose soft but frumpy exterior and Dublin accent give her a startling resemblance to Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire, serves as the house's mysterious cook/nanny, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) is the mysterious gardener, and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) is the mysterious young mute girl whose purpose seems mainly to be mysterious. They learn that any open door must be closed before another is opened, the curtains must always be closed, and the children must be kept on the edge of terror at all times. As usual in this type of movie, the house is just as much a character as anyone in the film. The place is ridiculously huge, with stone walls on the outside and dark wood interiors, ancient furniture and fixtures, and no electricity. The weather seems to be in a permanent foggy morning state, during the few times we actually see outside. This oppressive atmosphere would be good for horror if there were any horror to speak of in the film. But as it turns out, it's just oppressive. Though Kidman"
197,PGP_Doc7_TheOthers,PGP_Doc7_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Negative,TheOthers,"A Gothic mom-in-distress thriller for those who might believe in ghosts or at least are open-minded, or for those who like a scary puzzler story to be grounded in those old-fashioned techniques of getting at the human emotions rather than being a computerized technical special-effects production of the supernatural. It most closely resembles the Henry James story ""Turn of the Screw,"" as that one was filmed by Jack Clayton and was called ""The Innocents."" That film's premise is also of a woman desperately trying to save the two children in her care from invisible invaders in their house. The 29-year-old acclaimed Chilean-born, Spain-based director, Alejandro Amenabar (Open Your Eyes/Thesis), provides a surprise ending to this chiller, which the clever viewer might guess since there are enough clues laid down. That's something ""The Sixth Sense"" did, but there it worked better because the story was more plausible and less artsy, so when the surprise ending resulted it seemed more satisfactory than in Amenabar's film. The dark and somber tone of Amenabar's film lingers for too long to make it seem anything more than an atmospheric and stylish mumbo-jumbo scare film. It creeps along at a gruelingly slow pace, belaboring its point that ghosts can live among the living. The film is set in 1945, just as WW11 ended, in a remote house on the isle of Jersey, in the English Channel. But time seems irrelevant, as it could be set at any time, though the story fits most readily into the Victorian period. The mansion is inhabited by a stern, bossy, high-strung, Bible fundamentalist Catholic mother, Grace (Nicole Kidman-looking like Grace Kelly in the 1940s), her two vulnerable children, Ann (Alakina) and Nicholas (Bentley), and three odd servants who mysteriously show up and offer their services when the other servants fled for no apparent reason not even bothering to collect their wages. The servants include: the head housekeeper, Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan- a noted Irish actress), the gardener, Mr. Tuttle (Sykes), and a young cleaning lady who is mute, Lydia (Cassidy). The house is not only creepy and filled with ghost sounds, but is enveloped in darkness because all the windows must be covered with thick curtains as the children are mysteriously allergic to the light and if exposed it could be fatal to them. Grace is the household head because her husband Charles (Eccleston) has not returned from the war and has been reported as a MIA, though she still has some hope that he will return. In the house there is no telephone, no radio and no electricity. Also, ""no door must be opened unless the one before is closed."" There are 50 doors, 15 keys, and enough dark corners and creaky floorboards to even scare a dead person. When those cliched scary formula effects don't work enough scares, the background music goes into a high crescendo to add more chills. Another scare tactic used is when the scene shifts outside and the house is covered in fog and"

Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" and start bringing haunted house mysteries and metaphysical thrillers a-la-Hitchock our way. Unfortunately for us, the timing is sooner rather than later. Set in 1945 on Jersey, one of the Channel Islands situated between Britain and France, World War II is over. A pasty, clammy-looking young woman named Grace lives with her two small children on a large estate in a manor house shrouded in darkness and fog. Her husband, who had gone off ""to fight the baddies"" in the war, has not yet returned home and Grace anxiously awaits his return despite his being presumed dead for the past 1 12 years. Her children, young Nicholas who is scared of his own shadow, and his sister, the precocious, inquisitive Anne, suffer from such a sensitivity to light that should they be exposed to anything above a dim oil lamp or candle flicker, they will die. Over-the-top, Bible-obsessed Christian that she is, Grace home schools the children in what appears to be their only subject  religion  in anticipation of Anne's First Communion and the life hereafter with all of its various hells. Servants engaged by Grace mysteriously vanish during the night, the most recent set of which left the preceding week with such suddenness they failed to even collect their wages. In response to an advertisement for a new staff, a grandmotherly Irish woman named Mrs. Mills, her apparent gentleman friend Mr. Tuttle and the young mute Lydia appear at the door seeking employment just as suddenly as the old servants disappeared. Interestingly, the advertisement has yet to even be mailed to the paper for publication. After sending Mr. Tuttle off to commence gardening, Grace escorts Mrs. Mills and Lydia throughout the house, explaining ""the rules"" as they go. When entering or exiting a room, each door must be locked before another may be opened. There is, of course, a key for each of the 50 doors in the house. Curtains must always be drawn  not due just to the children's light sensitivity, but as a measure to ease Grace's migraines. There is to be no noise. And above all, one must not believe any ""stories"" told by the children. Anne, it seems, believes in ghosts and ""the others"" that she claims reside in the house, using this belief to both petrify her whiney little brother and drive her non-believing tightly wound mother to the very edge of madness. Writer/Director Alejandro Amenabar does an adequate job creating the eeriness and creepiness of a haunted house, giving us the requisite piano playing in the middle of the night, tromping and clomping of footsteps on the upper floors, opening and closing of locked doors, noises in the middle of the night (although in the dark house it could be the middle of the day for all we know), cluttered attics, seances and"
199,PGP_Doc9_TheOthers,PGP_Doc9_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Negative,TheOthers,"The Others, Alejandro Amenabar's suave new ghost story, takes place in an isolated house on the island of Jersey, in the English Channel. The year is 1945, but the house and its inhabitants -- a strict, high-strung mother, her two children and three servants dressed in funereal black -- belong to the timeless, vaguely Victorian world of classic English fright fiction. Mr. Amenabar, the young Spanish director who wrote and directed the film, his first in English, enhances the spookiness of the setting with an elaborate and ingenious conceit. When the three servants show up on her doorstep, Grace (Nicole Kidman), the lady of the house, explains to them that there is no telephone, no radio and no electricity. What is more, her children, Anne and Nicholas, are both fatally allergic to sunlight, which means the windows must always be covered with heavy curtains, and ''no door must be opened unless the one before is closed.'' There are 50 doors, 15 keys and too many dim corridors, cavernous rooms and creaky floorboards to count. This exposition is delivered with the efficiency of a word problem in a math textbook; it's the director's way of laying out the technical puzzle he will toy with for the next two hours, rearranging the pieces with gratifying precision. The house appears to be haunted: Grace hears laughter and weeping through the walls; Anne insists that she has seen a little boy and a mysterious old woman; locked doors spring open; a piano plays itself. Mr. Amenabar's command of the syntax of fright is impressive. He knows that what we don't see scares us more than what we do see, and he uses some of the simplest, oldest resources of cinema -- reverse cuts, swift tracking shots, chattering cellos and screeching violins -- to induce prickles of dread and jolts of terror. For the first 40 minutes or so he weaves a tight web of ambiguity reminiscent of ''The Turn of the Screw.'' Are the children playing tricks on their hysterical mother? Are the servants trying to unhinge their imperious boss? Is this haunting supernatural or psychological? Could any ghost be scarier than Grace herself, whose maternal temperament seems compounded of stern religious dogmatism, vengeful discipline and desperate need? Ms. Kidman embodies this unstable amalgam with a conviction that is in itself terrifying. The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of her expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date. Like Tilda Swinton in ''The Deep End,'' this week's other mom-in-distress thriller, she lifts her character above the conventions of the story into a realm of volatile, frenzied feeling made all the more poignant by her furious efforts to maintain control. The sight of Ms. Kidman barreling through the murky hallways in a confused, determined rage, brandishing a dusty shotgun, is one of the most thrilling movie images of this year. Coupled with her sly, stylized performance in ''Moulin Rouge,'' this role suggests that she is at"
200,PGP_Doc10_TheOthers,PGP_Doc10_TheOthers,PGP,Horror,Negative,TheOthers,"When the Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar made The Others, his first English-language film, 20 years ago, American horror films were in a state of limbo. The wave of neo-slashers sparked by Wes Craven's Scream had already run its course and it would still be a couple of years before other trends took hold, like the run of Japanese horror remakes like The Ring or the extreme cinema of Saw and Hostel, which seemed to reflect the darkening post-9/11 reality that other mainstream films were studiously avoiding. There was no better timing for an old-fashioned haunted house movie, which had always thrived in a state of limbo, where the living and the dead share the same space  and the audience can't always tell which is which. In truth, The Others seems like a direct reaction to two films from 1999: The Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan's unusually hushed and twisty breakthrough about a child who sees dead people, and The Haunting, a truly revolting attempt to give a classic psychological thriller the blockbuster treatment. Amenabar's answer was to issue a corrective to The Haunting remake by returning to the suggestive fundamentals of the 1963 version while replicating the nested surprises of Shyamalan's film, along with the dynamic of a stressed-out single mother and children who commune with the dead. He could be accused of shameless commercial calculation were it not for the fact that throwback films like The Others weren't getting made at all. Amenabar's other primary source here is 1961's The Innocents, an adaptation of Henry James' novella The Turn of the Screw, about a governess at a large estate who watches over two children she comes to believes are possessed. Nicole Kidman's impeccably sculpted hairstyle alone seems like a nod to Deborah Kerr's in the earlier film, though Amenabar has neutered the sexual undercurrents that gave The Innocents an extra charge. In fact, the one big problem with The Others, an otherwise alluring piece of horror craftsmanship, is that it never seems more substantial than mere mimicry, like a magician's apprentice showing off all the master's old tricks. The tricks are still dazzling, though, starting with the fog-choked setting of an estate on Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, but nonetheless conspicuous in its isolation. Even though the year is 1945 and the second world war has ended, there's an eerie feeling that protection from a conflict that ravaged Britain and France has also meant a severing of ties from humanity itself. As the film opens, Grace (Kidman) has not heard any news about her husband Charles, who hasn't returned from the war, and her anxiety bears down on her children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who both seem a little afraid of her. When a trio of servants appears unexpectedly to help manage the estate and nanny the kids, Grace tells their leader, Mrs Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) that they lost electricity during the war and never bothered to restore it.

Or at least, the closest place was the suburbs. When I went out to the suburbs, I had forgotten what suburbs are like with all the homogeneity and sterility, which was both disgusting and somewhat nostalgic, seeing as it reminded me of towns I had visited while in college. Much to my surprise, the theater chain that I was going to was a theater chain that I used to work at in college, and seeing as I had a new schedule at work, I went ahead and applied to be a projectionist at this new theater. I got the job, and no matter how shitty or annoying my days might have been working at the theater, I could always remember the first time visiting that theater as a customer. ENOUGH WITH THE MEMORIES, LET'S GET ON WITH THE REVIEW. The film opens with a segment of a family bringing their little boy to see a medium in hopes of helping remove a gypsy curse, but the medium fails and the ground opens up and the child is sucked down to Hell. FORESHADOWING, MUCH?! We then meet Chrstine (Alison Lohman), a young woman trying to move forward at the bank where she works, and her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long), a professor at the local college. An old woman (Lorna Raver) comes into Christine's bank, and in order to impress her boss with a tough decision, Christine refuses a loan extension, so the old woman stays after work to confront Christine. After the physical assault, the old woman steals a button from Christine's coat, utters some gypsy words, and then vanishes. THAT'S WHEN SHE GETS REAL. Spooky things start happening, from voices to shadows seemingly following Christine, and feeling like she's out of options, decides to speak to a medium who informs Christine that in three days, she's going to be dragged down to Hell. You messed with the WRONG old lady, Christine! With Christine NOT wanting to go to Hell, she tries to find the old woman, only to find that she has died since the curse has been given. Rut roh! Christine must seek other methods of losing the curse, from sacrificing her kitten to seeking guidance from the medium that was in the opening scene. Although the medium is able to summon the spirits, the crucial part of the ceremony doesn't take place, and Christine feels like she's out of options. She is then informed that, as a last resort, Christine can give the button as a formal gift to someone else, and that other person will take over the attention of the curse and be sucked down into Hell. While debating who to give the button to, an incredibly elderly man, the sleazy guy also going to Christine's promotion, she then realizes that she can give the button to the old woman's dead body as a formal gift.

202,PZJ_Doc2_Drag_me_to_hell,PZJ_Doc2_Drag_me_to_hell,PZJ,Horror,Positive,Drag_me_to_hell,"Director Sam Raimi returns to his roots with Drag Me to Hell, his self-described ""spook-a-blast"" chiller that has no intention of allowing the viewer even a moment of reprieve. Potent beyond belief, this insanely frightening film plays like a funhouse of horror. It teems with shocks, menace, and comic tension, and it refuses to yield until the last frame. The picture balances humor and rushes of nightmarish dread in a creep-show experience that takes pleasure from its own wickedness. Through it all, Raimi, returning to the genre where clearly he was meant to be, drives his film with wit and style, all while simultaneously revolting his audience. And yet, Drag Me to Hell never feels cheap or exploitative; its most effective moments rely on convincing and sympathetic characters. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) wants to earn a crummy assistant manager promotion at her bank, but she has to compete with her sniveling newbie coworker for the attention of her slimy boss (David Paymer). She's a tangible character with realistic aspirations, aptly played by the sympathetic and sweetly innocent Lohmanshe's not the usual horror movie victim whom the audience can't wait to see receive her just deserts. When Christine denies Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an old Gypsy woman, a third extension on her mortgage, the woman attacks her (in a slapstick parking garage duel of epic proportions) and infects her with a curse. Over the next three days, a demon spirit called a ""Lamia"" slowly materializes with the intention of doing as the title suggests, dragging Christine down to hell for punishment. Haunted by the wraithlike shadows of the Lamia goat-creature, and suffering sudden appearances by Mrs. Ganush's phantom presence, poor Christine is subject to unbelievable tortures, particularly when considering the PG-13 rating. With everything from maggots to embalming fluid to old lady sputum vomited into Christine's mouth by the ghastly things terrorizing her, the film will test your gag reflexes. At one point, she attempts to endure the Lamia's taunts during a meal with her skeptic boyfriend (Justin Long) and his parents; all at once, Christine hacks up a fly, which proceeds to buzz around the dinner table. That would mark the end of any formal gathering. Eventually, she enlists the help of a psychic medium, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), to help her remove the curse. She tries everything from animal sacrifices to a seance to rid herself of the Gypsy woman's scourge. This is the film Sam Raimi fans have waited for since the early 1990s. Seemingly tempered by studio pictures and a particular Marvel franchise, Raimi's signature brand of unabashed directorial energy displayed on The Evil Dead Trilogy and Darkman has been suspiciously absent from his recent output. The sole exception occurred in Spider-Man 2 when Dr. Octopus first awakens after having metallic arms fused to his back, and the arms tear down doctors with all the fervor of a Deadite. Efforts like The Gift and A Simple Plan demonstrate what a fine storyteller Raimi can be, but Drag"

He'd made his name in the horror genre with the Evil Dead movies, but he also branched out to other genres in the 90s, with the western The Quick and the Dead, the crime thriller A Simple Plan, and the romantic drama For Love of the Game. In the early 2000s, Raimi thrilled nerds once again (well, mostly) with the Spider-Man movies, which gave audiences a profitable, family-friendly superhero far before the Marvel Cinematic Universe rose to prominence. But if audiences forgot this was the same director who brought us some of cinema's most hilariously disgusting horror, Raimi reminded us with the movie Drag Me to Hell, a delicious slice of wicked B-movie fun. The tagline for the movie pulled no punches. The poster tells us, ""Christine Brown has a good job, a great boyfriend, and a bright future. But in three days, she's going to hell."" In other words, this could potentially be any of us who made a bad decision and got far more than they bargained for. 2009 was probably the only time Drag Me to Hell could've ended the way it did, with (spoiler!) protagonist Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) literally dragged to hell. True, Christine may be a loan officer (which is right up there with IRS workers in terms of most despised on-screen professions), but it's easy for us to see ourselves in her struggles, making her both sympathetic and easy to root for. There's a slot for a cushy position at work, and she's competing against a backstabbing colleague for it. Christine also has to deal with underappreciation and sexism, with her boss asking her to grab him a sandwich on her lunch break. It's eventually revealed that Christine worked her way up from a harsh rural childhood with an alcoholic mother, and her loving boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) is being pressured to date someone with a higher social and financial status. So when Christine is told that the right person for the promotion is the one who can make ""tough decisions,"" it's deeply understandable why she chose to deny the elderly Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) a third extension on her mortgage, even after Mrs. Ganush begs on her knees. The problem is, she turns out to be a gypsy, and places a terrible curse on Christine, summoning an evil demon called the Lamia, which torments its victim over the course of three days, then literally drags them to hell. The effects become apparent immediately, quickly escalating from mysterious voices to outright violence. Be warned: Drag Me to Hell is a scary movie that's actually scary, and there's no doubt that Christine's torment is real. This is a shadowy, evil, force sends Christine horrifying, disgusting dreams that involve flies, vomiting, and worms. The Lamia is also physically violent, punching Christine in the face and throwing her through the air. It also seems to know when it would be"

Then, amazingly, the filmmaker whose highest grossing movie of his career didn't even top $40 million at the domestic box office was given the reins to the iconic Marvel character Spider-Man. There was a demand for comic book movies at the time but Raimi's Spider-Man was such a smash hit that it brought superhero cinema into a full-fledged pop culture phenomenon. After a successful trilogy that pulled in well over a billion dollars in the North America alone, Raimi moved on from the web-slinger. His first movie after the greatest successes of his career would be Drag Me to Hell, a movie Raimi co-wrote with his brother Ivan and would see the director returning to his horror roots. Nine years after its release, Drag Me to Hell lands on Blu-ray with a new special edition from the dedicated horror nuts at Scream Factory, an edition that honors this often overlooked example of purely distilled Sam Raimi cinema. The plot for Drag Me to Hell is straightforward and to the point. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is piecing her life together living in Los Angeles. She works as a loan officer at a bank with her eyes set on a promotion to assistant manager. Christine is dating a young doctor Clay (Justin Long). Things are on the upswing for the somewhat shy young woman. That is until Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) enters the bank one day seeking an extension on her home loan. At that moment Christine is presented with a choice to make. Eager for that promotion, Christine decides to try and impress her boss and reject Mrs. Ganush's extension. That evening, as Christine walks out to her car, she's attacked by a belligerent Ganush and the scuffle ends with the old gypsy placing a curse on Christine. The evil spirit of the Lamia will haunt her for three days until it finally burst through this earthly plane and will drag Christine to Hell where she'll be tortured through eternity. Sam Raimi brings such an efficiency to the horror of Drag Me to Hell, knowing exactly where he's taking his characters and easily guiding the story along to horrific moment after horrific moment. Since the film is dealing with a deadly supernatural entity, Sam and Ivan Raimi allow the character of the spiritualist Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) to serve as the main channel of expository dialogue. There's this perfect balance between not over-explaining the events of the film while still pulling the audience into this twisted world of demons from Hell. More importantly, Sam Raimi knows what you want out of a movie entitled Drag Me to Hell and, dammit, he's going to give it to you. The horror filmmaking of Sam Raimi is very much like a rollercoaster ride. First there's a jolt to get your attention. Then the terror twists and turns with escalating dread and ease"

Bliss? Is frisson somehow appropriate here? I guess it would all depend, largely, on how you feel about horror movies in the first place. But let's say you do. Like them, that is. In which case, a tricked-out number such as Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell, co-written by Raimi and his brother Ivan, will delight not just on the frenetic-fright level that Raimi set a certain bar for in his Evil Dead films of the '80s, but also for the ruthlessness with which it toys with viewer sympathies. To get into this a bit will require the use, alas, of some substantive spoilers. Which I will place, although perhaps not immediately, below the jump. Beware. Be warned Raimi's Evil Dead films, beginning in 1981 with the just regular Evil Dead, an ultra-low budget DIY landmark, conflated hysterical laughter with hysterical screaming by making explicit the always-present link between horror violence and slapstick. Raimi's most obvious antecedents/inspirations were, of course, the Three Stooges, whose eye-gouging, strangulating, head-smiting antics would have caused grave if not fatal injuries if performed in earnest and in real life. Raimi upped the ante with gore, even more pronounced creepy/funny sound effects than you found in an average Stooges short, and a hyper moving camera style. Not to mention cutting that screamed ""Boo!"" over and over again at breakneck speed. The pictures established him as a gonzo horror maestro, but on entering Hollywood proper he applied his style to a number of different genresthe superhero movie (Darkman), the ""straight"" thriller (A Simple Plan) and even a baseball picture (For Love of the Game). His work on the blockbuster Spider Man films mostly subsumed his innovative side, alas, and that's one reason Drag Me To Hell's got fans of his earlier work excited. As well they should be. Ultra-extreme vomiting and swallowing are among the shock effects Raimi's added to the Dead bag of tricks, and they shift the horror action slightly away from Stooges territory and into the realm of great animation gagmen Tex Avery, Frank Tashlin, and Chuck Jones. Indeed, there's a bit involving an anvil hanging from the ceiling of a toolshed that could have come straight out of a Road Runner cartoonand the bug-eyed reaction when the anvil drops is the live-action equivalent of one of the escaped-con-wolf's double takes upon finding he's still got Droopy on his tail in Northwest Hounded Police. But while the Evil Dead pictures kind of prided themselves on their thoroughly one-dimensional characterizationsthere was the stolid and rather somewhat stupid square-jawed hero Ash, surrounded by malevolent demons and not much else, at least until 1992's Army of Darkness, in which he teamed up with a bunch of medieval clodshere Raimi goes for...well, I wouldn't call it depth, exactly.

Let's not confuse Dong with Vinny, however, who would literally cry if the breeze hit him the wrong way. Dong would really only cry when we teased him and we soon found, as little shit kids love to do, the easiest way to push the poor lad to tears. ""Dong, the gypsies are coming,"" we would chant. ""The gypsies are coming to take to you away."" Even though we had no idea what a gypsy was or why they were purported to steal children, such provocation turned Dong into a blubbering mess. Once he even threw at chair when someone pushed him too hard. I hope to hell that poor Dong does not see Drag Me to Hell, Sam Raimi's return to the splatter flick genre that made him famous after years making mainstream blockbusters such as Spider-Man. See, Drag Me to Hell features one very pissed off Gypsy woman who, like all Gypsies must do in horror films, curses poor Alison Lohman's Christine after she refuses to grant her an extension on her housing loan. More a comedy-horror in the vein of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness rather than a film created to inspire fear in the hearts of intrepid viewers, Drag Me to Hell allows Raimi the opportunity to return to his old tricks of Three Stooges-type body humor and a chance to play with beasties that spew goo and like to scream in distorted voices. See, poor Christine isn't all bad. A momentary lapse of better judgment and the desire to wrest a promotion away from a brown-nosing, shitbag colleague (Reggie Lee) informs her decision to foreclose on the Gypsy's house. Call it the wrong place at the wrong time, but this choice gets Christine a one-way curse to hell when her despondent client sics an angry demon on her ass. Unfortunately, Lohman does not possess the natural charisma Bruce Campbell brought to the Evil Dead series and her ersatz charm is not enough to carry the picture. Supporting players like boyfriend Clay (Mac-guy Justin Long) and spiritual guru Rham (Dileep Rao) have neither the acting chops nor the script to be anything more than incidental characters. So the entire production rests on the shoulders of Lohman and her battle against an invisible goat-demon named the Lamia. Raimi will never be a great filmmaker, but Drag Me to Hell is more a series of squirm-inducing scenes than a cohesive film. Sure, there are plenty of gross-out scenes (including a classic battle between Christine and the Gypsy in a moving car), but rather than amount to a film that really chills the bones, Raimi mixes ""gotcha!"" moments with scenes so over the top, there is nothing to do but laugh. Drag Me to Hell will never be more than a minor work in Raimi's oeuvre, mainly because it's really nothing new for him. After the"

Could be my dimestore Catechism wasn't dark enough to do lasting damage, but hell-with-a-capital-h very rarely delivers the necessary shiver-shock of true horror. When I'm in the market for a new nightmare, I'll take a man wearing a mask over fire and brimstone every time.more Demons and curses and red lava lakes are the cartoon versions of real terror, and playing up the absurdity of eternal damnation is how Sam Raimi made his name. With Drag Me to Hell, he returns to the goofy realm of malediction and prayer, of grossed-out giggles and groans. Alison Lohman, a refinement of the Jenna Fischer model of mousiness, stars as Christine Brown, whose professional aspirations are as dull as her name. Looking to prove her mettle and climb the ladder in her loan department, Christine denies a crone's request for a mortgage extension. With her bejewelled fingers tapering to crusty yellow nails, her mismatched eyes and her Slavic croak, old Mrs. Ganush is clearly a Gypsy witch, so instead of asking to speak to Christine's manager, she calls a curse down on the perky little loan officer's pretty little head. What follows is, for the most part, a dispiritingly rote exercise in comic dread. Raimi's sick sense of humor quickens the routine at intervals, never more so than in two uproarious scenes of animal sacrifice, but Drag Me to Hell squanders an ungodly amount of screen time on needless narrative explication. Imagine a version of Army of Darkness in which Bruce Campbell's Ash sits around whinging about the Necronomicon instead of questing after it. And sure, the horror that interrupts Christine's lethargy is thrillingly ridiculous, if a bit too reliant on humorous fluids and cheap digital effects, but there's simply not enough of it. Raimi is a master designer of rickety, haunted house set pieces. He is not a great storyteller, and he doesn't write characters anyone can actually care about. That's fine. In fact, I prefer not to bond too much with people who are about to be eviscerated. But then why the endless chatting and dithering and over-explaining by characters who seem so anxious to get it all over with that they've pre-emptively stiffened with rigor mortis? The legitimately pleasing touches of absurditya possessed slice of cake, a coughed-up cat, Justin Long as a psychology professorjust aren't worth the struggle it takes to make it through long stretches of apathetic moviemaking.

A young woman aspiring for big professional opportunities at a bank makes a grievous error with a mysterious woman who arrives at her desk pleading for help, resulting in a horrific curse that anchors the crosshairs of torment onto her soul for a resulting 100 minutes of loud and foreboding celluloid. Her house thumps with the thundering sounds of something monstrous, and then a shadowy form tosses her around like a torn rag doll. She is attacked in her office garage. Animals hiss and growl as she walks by. She is assailed by visions of a malevolent being who makes clear his purpose of pulling her into an afterlife of endless torture and suffering. And then the movie demands the panic-stricken victim to sacrifice a kitten in a vain attempt to ward off the evil presence... and in that moment, a deplorable line is crossed. For the remaining running time, no more is it our concern as to whether she is going to emerge from the experience in tact or unscathed; the real hell eluded to by said title now becomes the movie theater, where moviegoers go from being surprised and thrilled to completely appalled by some contemptible plot decisions. After a certain point, the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape. The movie is the brain child of Sam Raimi, who was made famous in this genre early on with the ""Evil Dead"" series, and then departed the trenches of B-movie horror comedy in favor of loftier Hollywood ambitions. The results were eclectic but effective, yielding the marvelous ""A Simple Plan,"" a taut thriller called ""The Gift,"" and the box office triumph of the first three ""Spider Man"" movies. Somehow, after those achievements, Raimi's mind convinced itself that revisiting the past was a wise decision, perhaps strengthened by the noting that more money for a film budget was as his disposal, and the support of a major studio would give him certain freedoms with this approach that were not allotted to him so many years prior. Sometimes, they say, the past is better left there. The movie stars Alison Lohman as Christine Brown, the would-be heroin of the story, who is basically a collection of insecurities masquerading around under the veneer of opportunistic intentions. She is a financial consultant at a bank, vying for an assistant manager position and doing nearly anything possible to try and impress her indecisive boss, who is also considering a potentially more qualified candidate for the job. Those lofty ambitions are realized when an old and grotesque woman (Lorna Raver) comes to her desk, begging for a third extension on her house's mortgage. Christine feigns sympathy, but denies the claim and leaves her at the mercy of a foreclosure. The old woman begins causing a public scene by getting on her knees, to which Christine calls security"

She also suffers what might be cinema's most epic nosebleed, almost drowns in a muddy grave, and generally gets bashed around. A less dignified role for a young actress would be hard to imagine, but then if you want dignity you don't look to Sam Raimi in his manic-diabolical B-movie mode. Raimi, the cult-favorite auteur behind the madly inventive and sensationally entertaining Evil Dead series, has been playing with the big boys lately (his last three films were the highly lucrative Spider-Man trilogy). Drag Me to Hell is his welcome-home to the low, disreputable fun of his drive-in-schlock roots. But there's a note of mean-spiritedness I haven't detected in his work before. The movie is manic and gross, all right, but not much fun unless you enjoy watching an attractive 29-year-old woman getting punished repulsively over and over. It should be a big hit with guys who collect bukkake porn. Lohman, in the role of nice but eager-for-promotion loan officer Christine Brown, is being punished for refusing to grant an old gypsy woman (Lorna Raver) an extension on her mortgage. Raver, a TV veteran, is required to remove her dentures in lurid close-up and beg Christine on her knees for mercy  and that's before she reappears as a grasping, murderous harridan. Drag Me to Hell certainly expresses disgust at ambitious young women and destitute old women; the gypsy is still doing revolting things even when she's dead. Christine's callousness has brought a curse upon her, and the old crone doesn't just want to send her to hell outright  she wants Christine to suffer first. All right, setting aside the film's troublesome misogyny, Drag Me to Hell is clearly intended as a Saturday-night flick to make teenagers howl and squeal and gag. Most of it isn't scary, though. ""I recognize terror as the finest emotion,"" Stephen King once wrote, ""and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find that I cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if I find that I cannot horrify, I'll go for the gross-out. I'm not proud."" Raimi isn't proud, either. The style is disappointingly earthbound coming from a man who once had to make his own cheap camera mounts to get the insane, looping shots he wanted  a good portion of Drag Me to Hell looks like television, and even the spooky stuff is largely a matter of bumps in the night and ooga-booga shadows. The horror is very tame. The script, by Raimi and his brother Ivan, had been sitting around collecting dust for decades, and maybe there's a reason for that  the story is blithely padded out to allow for maximum torment of the heroine, at the expense of logic. Christine tries all sorts of things to free herself of the curse, pumping money into a sympathetic spiritual counselor for advice that never"

At the very least, it should inspire a banquet of dread or offer a canape of anxiety. After Drag Me to Hell you won't mind walking home alone. You might even welcome a dark, deserted alley. It could help alleviate the anger of knowing you've been had. This is surprising, since Drag Me to Hell is the creation of writer-director Sam Raimi, whose body of work has been dedicated to turning more than one viewer's hair white with the Evil Dead and Spider-Man franchises. The only thing he's likely to turn a viewer to this time is the door marked exit. For God only knows what reason, it begins with a prelude staged in 1969 in Pasadena. A kid steals a necklace from a gypsy wagon and takes refuge in one of those old houses that look like W. C. Fields lived there. The doors slam open; people fall to their deaths; the floor opens and sucks the little thief into a cauldron of flames; and the house goes back to looking like a silent-film set. Forty years later, a pretty loan officer in a California bank named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman, sometimes unfairly confused with Lindsay Lohan) refuses to extend a delinquent loan to an ancient hag with one eye and a mouth full of black incisors who has an epileptic fit in the middle of the bank and puts a curse on the young career girl. The nightmare begins. The crone attacks her in the underground parking garage, wrecks her car and rips a button from her coat. Soon she hears the same voices the little boy heard back in 1969. A bug crawls into her nose in the middle of the night. The next day at work she spews blood all over the bank. Her boyfriend (Justin Long) pooh-poohs the whole thing, until she bakes a harvest cake to impress his snobby parents and a human eye pops out of the batter with the kind of ensuing dinner-table chaos that guarantees a short engagement with no need for the bridal registry at Bloomingdale's. Seeking the help of a loopy carnival medium, Christine finds herself up to her pierced ears in corpse vomit, animal sacrifice, violent seances and open graves. Nothing stops the curse. The road to deliverance leads to the same old house in Pasadena containing the doorway to hell, but the movie doesn't end there. There's still a preposterous finale in a grotesque cemetery that tickles the funny bone more than it assaults the nervous system. Sound effects play an important part in the superficial mechanics (pots and pans rattle, glass shatters, powerful forces knock people to the floor), and to Mr. Raimi's credit, there is no happy ending. Still, the first rule in spook films is ""If you want to hold the audience's attention, make them believe the horror could really happen""a rule Drag Me to Hell ignores at its"

Reilly. Making their previous vehicles Step Brothers and Talladega Nights seem the height of comic sophistication by comparison, Holmes & Watson features the duo parodying Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters to devastatingly unfunny effect. Numerous talented British thespians are wasted in supporting roles in this Christmas turkey that, not surprisingly, wasn't screened in advance for critics. Although making them troop out to theaters Christmas morning is something of which even Ebenezer Scrooge wouldn't have approved. Written and directed by Etan Cohen (previously responsible for the similarly witless Ferrell comedy Get Hard), the film begins with a prologue featuring a schoolboy Holmes being bullied by his boarding school classmates. The humiliation drives young Sherlock to suppress his emotions in favor of cold, calculating logic, which, as origin stories go, won't cause Spider-Man to lose any sleep. Cut to the grown Holmes and Watson attempting to thwart their nemesis Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes, mainly letting his beard do the acting) and solving crimes. When a dead body is found inside a giant birthday cake at Buckingham Palace, the duo is charged by Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) with the task of investigating the case. Assisting them in their efforts are the American Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her mute assistant Millicent (a very funny Lauren Lapkus, practically stealing the film), who was ""raised by cats."" The two women become love interests for the bachelor duo, with Watson and Grace bonding while performing an autopsy to the strains of ""Unchained Melody"" and Holmes becoming enchanted by the daffy Millicent. There's at least one scene that proves mildly amusing, when Holmes silently communicates with his brother Mycroft (Hugh Laurie, who had the good sense to go uncredited) via their shared ability to ""brainspeak."" It's a slyly witty moment that contrasts with the otherwise lame slapstick permeating the frenetic proceedings. A gag involving the eating of raw onions isn't so much running as limping. And there's a strange amount of anachronistic Donald Trump-related humor, including bits about fake news and red MAGA hats (here reading ""Make England Great Again"") that fall utterly flat in this context. But those are certainly preferable to the laborious scene in which Holmes and Watson desperately try to hide the body of the apparently dead queen, or the Disney-style musical number performed by Ferrell and Reilly that at least sounds authentic thanks to having been composed by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. A subplot involving the Titanic seems mainly designed to showcase a cameo by one of the stars of James Cameron's film about the doomed ship, which presumably played funnier in the writers' room than it does onscreen. Ferrell and Reilly flounder in their titular roles, and when Steve Coogan makes a brief appearance, it only serves to remind you of the sublime work he and Reilly do in the upcoming Stan & Ollie. Kelly Macdonald gamely attempts to score laughs"

Enter the established comedy duo of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, as Holmes and Watson respectively, and the conceit this time seems to be that the actors' goofball rudery and physical knockabout  seen in previous pairings Talladega Nights (2006) and Step Brothers (2008)  will generate gales of laughter when shoehorned into the seemingly inappropriate context of a Conan Doyle-style detective saga. Unfortunately, howls of anguish are the result, since poor material, ill-timed performances and an all-encompassing air of desperate cluelessness create a mirth-free zone. Part of the problem is that writer-director Etan Cohen (not Ethan Coen, an important distinction) doesn't quite know what to do with Ferrell's facility for playing pompous fools. Here then are gags where the great detective's elaborate deductions cause only chaos, notably in a tiresomely extended set piece involving the pursuit of an escaped disease-carrying mosquito; yet there are also key plot points where Holmes's convention-defying conclusions (that the Moriarty brought to trial is an impostor, for instance), while unlikely, prove absolutely correct. There is no consistency in the telling, making it unclear how seriously we should take anything. A dismal sense of 'so what?' sets in early, and certainly isn't helped by direction that struggles to shape the proceedings with any sense of urgency or tension. It all stands or falls, therefore, on the gags themselves, and there's very little here that hits the mark. Various bits of business show the central duo 'inventing' the selfie (with an ungainly box camera) and drunk texting (via telegram, which Holmes dubs the 'intoxigraph'), while elsewhere the film looks to poke fun at changes in social attitudes, underlining Holmes's liberal use of cocaine and his inability to conceive that a woman can actually be a qualified doctor. The comic intentions are obvious but barely warrant a smile, which makes for a long 90 minutes, with the occasional puerile pratfalls and sheer waste of Ralph Fiennes, Rebecca Hall and Kelly Macdonald only intensifying the gloom. Glaring anachronisms, such as a gramophone playing The Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody in a senseless Ghost-themed skit, or the launch of the Titanic a good 30 years too early (cue a truly pitiful Billy Zane cameo as 'himself'), indicate a film scrabbling around for something, anything, to raise a chuckle. Alas, without success. With apologies to Jordan Peele, 'the sunken place' has found its cinematic form."

Admittedly, it's no Step Brothers, and I can't help wishing for a more bizarre cut of the film (there's an undercurrent of weirdness to the whole affair that feels somehow tempered), but if it feels a little elementary compared to the best of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's work (the aforementioned Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, etc.), that's not necessarily a damning distinction. That Ferrell and Reilly should take on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, feels like a logical next step for the comedy duo, as they've made something of a speciality out of two-handers featuring Ferrell as the bright star and Reilly as the yearning sidekick. Granted, their particular spin on Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creations paints his legendarily brilliant pair as emotionally stunted morons, but the point still stands: There's an archetype that the story fulfills that's a perfect match. What makes the film more than a retread, however, is also what makes it so unwieldy. As the detective and doctor work toward foiling an assassination attempt on the Queen (Pam Ferris) by none other than Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), the situations they find themselves in become increasingly bizarre. Part of it is to do with the fact that cracking the case is secondary to cracking open their hearts, and part of it is a seeming indecision as to exactly what Holmes and Watson is meant to be. It's not quite the absurdist art that Step Brothers is, nor entirely the political commentary of Talladega Nights (a sharper look at the Bush years than this year's Vice, with all due apologies to Adam McKay); instead, it falls halfway in between, failing to make a completely coherent meal out of either approach. That said, if I had to wager (with the full acknowledgment that such speculation is meaningless), I would say that director Etan Cohen was trying for something more in line with the former, as there are bizarre interludes scattered throughout that suggest a much stranger film. The best word to describe those moments is ""grotesque,"" as the film's sense of humor goes beyond the usual scatological jokes  plus the requisite period comedy jabs at modern culture and technological advancements, and some laughs at the expense of previous iterations of Holmes and Watson  and ventures into genuinely strange territory. One scene, doubling down on Watson's status as a sidekick rather than an equal, introduces something called the ""companions' room."" The roster of characters introduced there is so strange that their split-second appearance, a far cry from the triter set pieces that populate the rest of the film, is deeply jarring. Another gag spins fun out of the effects of poison, while the film's opening sequence alone involves not only turtle rehabilitation but the coining of the term ""un-crying."" It's that weirdness that makes the film's big emotional payoff"

Sony is doing its best to bury 'Holmes & Watson' this Christmas with no pre-release critics screenings and a minimum of early word. While it would be glorious to report that costars Will Ferrell and John C Reilly have rekindled the infantile brilliance of their inspired 'Step Brothers', that would be lying. The duo will only benefit from us forgetting about its latest collaboration, a movie that should go to its room without any dinner. Bumbling versions of Arthur Conan Doyle's famous sleuth and assistant weren't high on any viewer's wish list, least of all in a film that takes satiric jabs at the already-forgotten Robert Downey Jr series. But that's what 'Holmes & Watson' reveals itself to be: an opportunity for prissy British accents (nowhere near enough shouty panic from actors who have perfected it), inept investigating and a completely charmless, laughs-free experience. Immensely talented supporting players like Ralph Fiennes, Rebecca Hall, Rob Brydon and Kelly Macdonald fade into the scenery as Ferrell and Reilly work up a flop sweat trying to subvert Victorian decorum. (Take your pick: jokes about Holmes's penchant for hard drugs, jokes about the hilariousness of women becoming doctors or jokes about the central pair's repressed love for each other.) A musical number materialises out of nowhere, desperately. So does the Titanic  the actual boat, anachronistically  and even a Billy Zane cameo. By then you'll be fully checked out. If we had to light up our pipes and scientifically deduce who the culprit was, a finger would point to screenwriter-director Etan Cohen ('Get Hard'), unable to excite the material into playfulness. What makes Ferrell and Reilly's chemistry work elsewhere is our ability to see ourselves in their creations: super dumb NASCAR stars or developmentally arrested 12-year-olds. But literary detectives? That may have been a case worth leaving unsolved."

What about that part in Talladega Nights, when Ferrell's NASCAR champion and his best friend/sidekick say grace at the dinner table (""Dear Tiny Jesus, your golden fleece diapers and tiny little balled-up fists..."")? So riotous. Or how about any random scene from, say, Anchorman or Walk Hard? You can't go wrong with the former's ""Afternoon Delight"" sing-along, or anything in the latter involving drugs or Dewey Cox's Dylan phase. We're crying just thinking about them. It's easier, not to mention far less agonizing, to go back and just reminisce about those Ferrell/Reilly greatest-hits moments than to try and reckon with Holmes & Watson. It's so painfully unfunny we're not sure it can legally be called a comedy. Let's put it another way: You know that story about the monkey paw, where a grieving mother wishes for something and her wish comes true, only it's all twisted and wrong and horrible? Someone may have gotten a hold of one of those talismans and said, ""I'd love a Step Brothers reunion, maybe with a recognizable I.P."" and then a rotting, shambling corpse is suddenly knocking on the multiplex doors. The idea of giving Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters to a great screen duo surely seemed like a genius idea. You'd almost have to willfully want to squander the notion to screw it up this badly. You'd also have to be ignorant of the fact that, even if with A-list comic talent capable of turning this into more than just the sum of its wink-nudge Sherlock-foolery, you have to give them something more than a rough sketch to work with. That, dear friends, is elementa ... sorry, we're too depressed by this whole thing to even finish the joke. Perhaps it's best to use deductive logic to figure out what exactly happened here. Observe, the high concept/low return ratio, suggesting someone merely scribbled down an elevator pitch at the last second before a meeting  ""Um, Ferrell and Reilly as, ah, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson""  then were surprised to suddenly get a greenlight. Look closely at the recognizable traits of Ferrell's master detective and Reilly's beta-male sidekick, all of which are slightly exaggerated for effect and retro-fitted for the stars' personae yet never really utilized beyond reiterating: Yup, he's smart but also arrogant and stupid, and the other guy's his buddy! The desperate, extreme mugging of both actors  truly, a telltale sign that even they realized that the story, involving the escape of Holmes' archenemy Moriarty (really, Ralph Fiennes? Really?) and a plot to kill the Queen, wasn't much to hang gags upon, so they'd better make faces ASAP."
216,QRR_Doc6_Holmes_and_Watson,QRR_Doc6_Holmes_and_Watson,QRR,Comedy,Positive,Holmes_and_Watson,"One of the year's most critically shellacked movies (the pros were forced to watch it in theaters on Christmas Day alongside the common hordes), Holmes & Watson begins as ineptly as any comedy I've seen, and then settles into an agreeably silly groove that had the common hordes around me yukking it up. When it's bad it is, indeed, painful, but even third-rate Will Ferrell + John C. Reilly is more inspired than the noisy contraptions on either side of it in the multiplex. The twist is to make Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle's pillar of 19th-century rationalism, into the latest of Ferrell's posturing child-men, another symbol of the patriarchy's dimming light. After being tricked by grade-school classmates into kissing the arse of an ass when he thought he'd be kissing a girl, Holmes purges himself of emotion and becomes a giant brain doling out punishments to those who would underestimate his powers of ratiocination. Those powers in Holmes & Watson are rather elastic. Where the trend in modern Holmesiana has been to show the great detective as a stunted giant, Ferrell stunts the stuntedness, playing Holmes as a prissy drama queen who's at least half idiot and always  even when brilliant  a fount of chaos. He and his schoolmate, Dr. John Watson (Reilly), have never really left the playground. The rub is not that Ferrell and Reilly act like overgrown 11-year-olds  that was the hook in Adam McKay's Step Brothers, a high-water mark in modern infantile comedy. It's that Ferrell's brand of low comedy is best executed with high instincts  i.e., without the nudge-nudges and wink-winks. Watch Ferrell and Reilly make the breathless case to Richard Jenkins's exasperated father/stepfather in Step Brothers that they should be allowed to create a bunk bed by setting one twin bed atop another: Their enthusiasm is contagious. Watch the pair's Funny or Die line-for-line reenactment of the unintentionally surreal duet between Bing Crosby at death's door and a joyless David Bowie: so subtle, so sublime. Holmes & Watson, on the other hand, is camp. Worse: rhythmless camp. It has been consistently misdirected by its screenwriter, Etan Coen (no ""h,"" different guy), whose idea of editing is to make throwaway jokes broad and broad jokes bludgeoning. As a director, Coen commits comedy's most cardinal sin: He gets between us and the performers. (To see how central rhythm is, watch Reilly and Steve Coogan's delicate work in Stan and Ollie: The beats  and micro-beats  are exquisite.) The first 15 minutes or so of Holmes & Watson made me doubt I'd last the next 90, an impulse to flee that I also detected, with Holmesian sensitivity, in Ralph Fiennes, who's stuck playing Dr. Moriarty and/or a look-alike. You can read his frozen face: What did I get myself into? Rob Brydon's Inspector Lestrade is photographed to appear as diminutive as possible, and the actor gets to show none of his improvisatory gifts. Kelly Macdonald as Mrs. Hudson reveals why she's"

Does the fault lie in the fact that current iterations of Holmes  the Benedict Cumberbatch BBC series, the Guy Ritchie movies, even CBS' ""Elementary""  aren't all that faithful to the material, so satirizing it seems irrelevant? Could it be that the script by director Etan Cohen (""Get Hard"") never had a second draft? Or did Cohen not worry that everything on the page was not particularly funny because stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly would somehow will this painful material into amusement merely by showing up on set? The results are singularly awful, but there are three people who can emerge unscathed from this fiasco: Rebecca Hall, who elicits mild chuckles (the closest this film gets to laughter) as an American doctor who thinks 19th century medicine is as modern as science gets; costume designer Beatrix Aruna Pasztor (""The Brothers Bloom""), who brings color and wit to her period creations; and the marketing person at Sony who didn't pre-screen the film for critics, thus quashing advance word and ensuring it would be seen too late to make the deadline for most Worst of the Year lists. What plot there is revolves around Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and Dr. John Watson (Reilly) trying to stop a nefarious scheme by Professor Moriarity (Ralph Fiennes) to murder Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris, ""Call the Midwife""). Watson falls for Dr. Grace Hart (Hall), who pushes him to have Holmes treat him like a co-detective and not merely a sidekick, while Holmes is smitten by Millie (Lauren Lapkus), who has apparently been raised by feral cats. And that's about it. Granted, the story should, under better circumstances, exist merely as the hat rack upon which jokes hang, but there's nary a laugh to be found here. Most of the stabs at humor revolve around anachronism (Watson puts ""Unchained Melody"" on a Victrola, and he and Hart have ""Ghost""-style romantic interplay while conducting an autopsy), physical bits (our heroes knock Victoria about like Frank Drebin tackling Elizabeth II in ""The Naked Gun"") or Holmes' arrogance, and none of them land. I found myself watching moments like, say, Holmes and Watson traveling to a rough part of London, where streetwalkers beat and rob their carriage driver as they walk away obliviously, and thinking, ""Okay, that's a funny idea. But I'm not laughing."" A stellar supporting cast is put to waste here, if not downright desecrated; besides Fiennes, we get appearances from Steve Coogan, Kelly Macdonald, Rob Brydon and Hugh Laurie, all of whom were, one hopes, well compensated for adding this embarrassment to their resumes. (Laurie, it should be noted, plays Mycroft Holmes, a role that previously allowed his onetime comedy partner Stephen Fry to steal ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" out from under Robert Downey, Jr. Laurie neither takes nor is given a similar opportunity in"
218,QRR_Doc8_Holmes_and_Watson,QRR_Doc8_Holmes_and_Watson,QRR,Comedy,Positive,Holmes_and_Watson,"Many distinguished actors have played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, but few have done so with quite the unhinged abandon of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly  reunited here a decade after the unforgettable Step Brothers, where they starred as grown men still living with their parents and squabbling like little kids. Holmes and Watson is essentially a continuation of the same project, in the form of a parody that has less to do with the writings of Arthur Conan Doyle than it does with the spectacle of man-children playing dress-ups. Etan Cohen (Get Hard ) is the credited writer-director, but we're given the impression  accurate or not  that the leads are pretty much inventing their lines as they go along. As the world's greatest detective, Ferrell purses his lips, flutters his hands, and speaks in a strangled approximation of a refined English accent. As his loyal sidekick, Reilly stands by, nodding sagely and occasionally breaking out into a girlish giggle. Both spend a lot of time screaming at the tops of their lungs, recklessly brandishing dangerous weapons and congratulating each other on their superiority to everyone else  in a manner only possible for a couple of all-American yahoos pretending to be upper-crust 19th-century Brits. If you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time. In theory this dynamic duo is dashing around jolly old London in pursuit of nemesis Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), who has apparently returned from beyond the grave to sabotage Holmes' birthday party and threaten the life of Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris). The plot is so rickety it could fall apart at any moment ... which of course is partly the point in a film that aims for the pure, old-fashioned silliness of The Goon Show or early Steve Martin. Holmes and Watson is not for everybody, but if you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time. The joy of a relentlessly juvenile approach is that it succeeds in making every previous version of the material look just as ridiculous: Guy Ritchie's macho vehicles for Robert Downey Jr come in for special ribbing, but Cohen and his stars have surely taken a look at the BBC's maudlin Sherlock as well. There are broader satirical implications, too, even setting aside the handful of obligatory Trump jokes. With his brash eccentricities, his disdain for women and his ""superhuman"" intellect, Holmes can be viewed as a template for countless pulp heroes who have flourished since  all of them basically fantasy alter-egos for nerdy teenage boys. Ferrell, who has made a career out of mocking male insecurities, clearly understands this well. It's not for nothing that one of the early comic routines here has him and Reilly reeling off a list of increasingly elaborate synonyms for ""wanking""."
219,QRR_Doc9_Holmes_and_Watson,QRR_Doc9_Holmes_and_Watson,QRR,Comedy,Positive,Holmes_and_Watson,"Another spoof by the famous Ferrell and Reilly team. To sum up, if you're a fan of these two then you'll most likely enjoy their antics. The corollary holds true as well. Ralph Fiennes makes a good performance and lends the team some support for an otherwise dull script. The couple of cameos also help the movie. I won't ruin the surprise as to who they are. The movie takes place in the obvious city of mid-century 1900's London. Even though there are some serious anachronistic flaws, they seem to fit well with the campy story-line. There are plenty of chuckles but not as much hard belly laughs. I found many lines boorish but some of the shtick and references to current US politics were humorous. There are many things that are obvious and there are many lines that will garner a chuckle. It's all done within Ferrell's and Reilly's genre. I actually wanted to see the movie for its cinematography and scenery during that vintage period. That aspect didn't disappoint. The outfits are beautiful and make the movie more palatable especially if you allow yourself to get bogged down with the dull script. Although the movie tries to stay on script with classic Sherlock Holmes, it doesn't really live up to the standards. But, after all, this movie was not meant to be a classic played by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The campiest part was a comic musical piece starring Ferrell and Reilly. I can only say to that: ""Oh brother."" I wish I had received notice of this miscued melody, It would have been a perfect time to break for the bathroom. Over-all, I give the movie 2 stars as I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan and it's difficult to give anything related less. I am not sure if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would agree with me. If he had any sense of humor, he'd either give Holmes and Watson a thumbs up or he'd be spinning in his grave."

This movie contains much of the characteristics of the screenplays of the likes of Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, Happy Gilmore and yes Talledega Nights and Step Brothers. John C. Riley, a talented actor with a brilliant career teams up with Will Farrell, a man of many talents and winner of many Oscars and other awards. The classic John C. Riley and the legendary Will Farrell are the match made in heaven for comedy enthusiasts, and their roles in Holmes and Wattson should be cited for many years to come. The shear dignity of the comedy, the lack of boredom and cringe, and the fufillment of content with many packed in features such as ""Behind The Scenes of Holmes and Wattson"" brings the richest feature packed DVD movie either for rent or purchase to exist in the world. The ingenious screenwriting of Etah Cohen brings Sony's greatest classic since Crazy Rich Asians. This movie is sure to excite the family and is sure to be a gift stuffer this coming holiday season. All in all, I give Holmes and Wattson, a solid, 10/10."
221,RPX_Doc1_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX_Doc1_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX,Action,Positive,Angel_Has_Fallen,"It's hard to think of how to phrase this without it sounding accusatory, but Angel Has Fallen is all down to Gerard Butler. As devoted Secret Service agent and presidential ""guardian angel"" Mike Banning, he's been instrumental in powering a film that wasn't even the best ""Die Hard but in the White House"" movie of 2013 into a full-blown trilogy. After 2016's flatulent sequel London Has Fallen, this third instalment scales down the budget and shifts the focus onto Butler's character and the mounting physical and emotional toll of his exploits. It's the same approach we've recently seen used by other, longer-running action franchises on characters like James Bond and Ethan Hunt. That said, Angel Has Fallen doesn't show too much interest in being a character study. At the start of the film, President Aaron Eckhart has vacated office and Morgan Freeman, who played Vice President Allan Trumbull in the first two films, is now commander-in-chief. Against the advice of his doctors, a painkiller-popping Banning remains on active duty, right up until an assassination attempt on Trumbull shakes the nation. With the President in a coma and Banning as the only other survivor of the incredibly precise drone attack, our hero is framed as the mastermind behind it. It's not long before he escapes custody to clear his name and prevent the real culprits from having another bash at it. Olympus Has Fallen and its sequels have filled a gap in the multiplex listings for the sort of macho actioner that's widely considered to be quite retrograde these days. Where some commentators have shrugged ""at least it's less racist than the second one"" in their slightly warmer reviews of this third instalment, most of the series' nastier edges have been filed down on what seems likely to be the final chapter. It's been a case of ever-decreasing budgets as the trilogy has gone on, but new director and co-writer Ric Roman Waugh (whose previous efforts include the mid-budgeted crime dramas Snitch and Shot Caller) acknowledges that his star has always provided the production value anyway. Through all three films, Butler's all-in commitment to this character is watchable even when the action isn't. As a character, Banning isn't anywhere near John McClane in stature, but Butler's performance is consistently up there with the best of the countless surrogates that populate similar Die Hard knock-offs. With his fondness for sweary banter and stabbing baddies in the head, he's the unique selling point of this throwback franchise. The script, co-written with Robert Mark Kamen and Matt Cook, doesn't exactly challenge him, but he does get to explore the character early on as Banning comes to realise that he's not as indestructible as previous form would suggest. It doesn't stop him barrelling through the rest of the movie, but that's more than we've seen McClane do in the Die Hard sequels. However, the story isn't up to much. It's not so insultingly basic as to conceal that Danny Huston's private military contractor is going"

Though the underlying intent is clear  many people turn to film for some sort of escape from the drudgery of life  the expression is an inaccurate perspective of how people consume entertainment. Even if it's predictable or formulaic, a movie can engage viewers' minds with nostalgic elements, spectacle or some other facet. ""Angel Has Fallen"" is not a challenging film to watch  there is little to no ambiguity or inventiveness about the characters or how the story will ultimately play out  and is in fact pretty dumb for a movie that cost tens of millions of dollars to make. Nevertheless, it manages to be thoroughly enjoyable because of its mix of violent excess and the unintentional comedy that comes from a stilted script filled with 20 years worth of action genre cliches. ""Angel Has Fallen"" finds Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), the all-American Secret Service agent from ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""London Has Fallen,"" now guarding President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). Mike is starting to feel his age, with years of surviving high-stakes scenarios taking its toll on him physically. He's considering taking over as director of the Secret Service from David Gentry (Lance Reddick) in order to appease his wife, Leah (Piper Perabo), and provide a more stable future for their daughter. But his old war buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), knows that Mike can't quit the field and is addicted to the thrill of combat. After a devastating drone attack wipes out the entire presidential detail and leaves President Trumbull in a coma, FBI agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) arrests Mike under the belief that he orchestrated the assassination attempt. Upon escaping custody, Mike must clear his name by finding out who's trying to destroy the country, all without being apprehended by his former brothers-in-arms. ""Angel Has Fallen"" isn't a good movie. The amount of worn-out tropes, poorly written dialogue and awkward CGI would be an exhaustive list to recount. It's not a smart movie, either, with characters tactlessly dumping exposition and constantly referring to each other by their titles to underline who everyone is, apparently because it doesn't trust the audience to follow along. However, as soon as certain characters show up, the audience is already so far ahead of the film that it's hard to understand why there was even an attempt to inject mystery into the plot. Good quips, or even cheesy one-liners, are replaced with people just dropping F-bombs; brevity is the soul of wit, after all. But while ""Angel Has Fallen"" isn't smart, good or innovative in any way, it's a really fun time at the theater. Watching it by yourself may be a bit of a joyless slog, but it will likely go over like gangbusters with a group of friends to howl at the bad screenwriting, marvel at the impressively over-the-top"
223,RPX_Doc3_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX_Doc3_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX,Action,Positive,Angel_Has_Fallen,"No, it's not a typo. Angel Has Fallen is a four-star movie. The brazenly idiotic Has Fallen franchise (previous episodes were Olympus and London), which has been defined by sloppy action beats and perturbing American triumphalism (Take that, North Korea! And that, Middle East!) has somehow hit its stride third time round. This happens in movies. The ""third time's a charm"" rule has applied to everything from Goldfinger (third and best James Bond movie) to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (third and best Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" western) to Toy Story 3. And The Bourne Ultimatum. And Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Point being, by the third movie a franchise will often find its feet, or discover a particular groove or rhythm that was absent in the first two instalments. In Angel Has Fallen that new groove is the wheezy angsty ineptitude of middle age. Franchise star Gerard Butler is back, of course, playing the US secret service superagent Mike Banning, the loyal personal bodyguard of President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). Yet this time, as the movie opens, with a routine stolen from the Bond film Never Say Never Again (a training exercise disguised as real jeopardy), Banning is revealed to be addicted to painkillers and suffering from panic attacks and embarrassing dizzy spells. He loses his balance on the job, like a peaky high street pensioner overloaded with groceries, and when, barely three scenes in, he goes for an emergency check-up (his fourth visit, we learn, in as many months  the big hypo) the doctor warns him that his spine is a ""disaster"" and that he's one well-aimed headbutt away from permanent paralysis. This is great material, and Butler, now 49 and wearing every minute of it, is perfect for the part. There's not a hint of the gym here. No vanity pec-flex nonsense either (take note, Dwayne Johnson). Instead, with a touch of softly curving moobs and some dad-bod love handles, and with that crazy ""American"" Glas-Angeles accent, Butler still manages to exude an effortless and earthy masculinity, a kind, as the poet WB Yeats might have said, that is unnatural in an age like this. Banning, alas, doesn't have much time to process his impending mental breakdown. After two short scenes that establish his domestic bliss (slightly undercut by shots of our hero popping pills behind the bedroom door) with his supportive wife, Leah (Piper Perabo, taking over doting duties from Radha Mitchell), Banning is called back into action when a former army buddy and bigwig military contractor called Wade (Danny Huston, just delicious) goes rogue, kills half the secret service, sends Trumbull into a coma, sets up Banning as the prime suspect, and begins to initiate a war with Russia. OK, so it's not Dostoyevsky, but the plot isn't the thing. It's how the plot unfolds that counts. It makes no sense, for instance, for Wade to set up Banning as the patsy assassin, because Wade's ultimate goal is"

This is the third time he's been called upon to save the US president from assassination and just to raise the degree of difficulty another notch, his Secret Service agent, Mike Banning, has to do it while on the run from the law. Showing a shameful disregard for his past record, his former employers are accusing him of mounting the latest assassination attempt. To be fair, they have their reasons. The real culprits have put a lot of effort into framing him but we soon discover who they are and how they did it. While the FBI and the Secret Service remain in the dark, the script lets us in on the secret, successfully tucking the necessary bits of exposition into a series of action sequences which leave you little to time to think of anything other than the rapidly accelerating toll in collateral damage. We have a new president this time round. Possibly suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, Aaron Eckhart has retired from the role. He announced some time ago that his presidential alter ego would be going off to play golf and tend his presidential library. It's now the turn of Morgan Freeman, making his first return to the Oval Office in 21 years. He was in charge when a comet hit the Earth and obliterated much of it in 1998's Deep Impact. This time, the threats are closer to home, as you may guess the minute you set eyes on Danny Huston. He's an actor whose busy career has been based almost entirely on his talent for playing fork-tongued villains. Jada Pinkett Smith is here, too, cast as an FBI agent who remains unimpressed by Banning's claims of innocence, but the big surprise is Nick Nolte. After surviving a succession of shootouts, bombings and car crashes, Banning heads into the woods to find a hiding place and Nolte staggers out from behind a tree. He's playing Banning's father, Clay, a Vietnam veteran whose experience of the war has turned him into a recluse as well as souring him on the government and all its wars. And although he looks very much the worse for wear, he can still summon up the enthusiasm to pump some much needed pep into the dialogue. Butler, who's also looking very tired, perks up considerably once they begin to banter. And despite Clay's anti-war rhetoric, he still has use for his weapons training. During the next stand-off, he manages to blow up much of the forest, together with scores of bad guys The commercial success of this franchise has always been governed by its directors' ability to deliver the films at a cost deemed to be modest by Hollywood blockbuster standards.

He twice saved the life of the former President of the United States, once inside the White House and once during a diplomatic trip to London. Current President Alan Trumball (Morgan Freeman) holds Banning in such high regard he's thinking of promoting him to head the Secret Service once the agency's current director (Lance Reddick) retires. It's a plum opportunity, and one no one in their right mind should turn down. But Banning, even with age and physical exertion starting to take their toll upon him, isn't sure he wants to get out of the field, this man of action worried that sitting at a desk supervising others will be a waste of his lethal protective abilities. He might be right about that. After a devastating attack on Trumball via a massive miniature drone strike leaves all of Banning's Secret Service team dead and he and the President in the hospital, it becomes clear this agent isn't done serving his country in the field. This becomes especially true when he is arrested for the assassination attempt, dogged FBI investigator Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) stating in no uncertain terms all of the evidence points to him as the perpetrator. Knowing in his gut that Trumball is still in danger, Banning escapes the hospital and goes on the run knowing that those who framed him aren't going to want any loose ends and will likely attempt to track him down before he can uncover their identity. With Thompson on his tail and a bevy of highly-trained assassins gunning for him, this Secret Service legend will rise to the occasion one more time, and no matter what obstacles are tossed like a grenade his direction he'll protect the President of the United States whatever the personal cost might ultimately prove to be. I seriously doubt anyone who saw 2013's Die Hard knock-off Olympus Has Fallen could ever have imagined they were witnessing the first installment in what would prove to be ""the Mike Banning trilogy."" But after 2016's London Has Fallen and now this latest chapter of the series Angel Has Fallen that is exactly what we now have. These films are aggressively violent, moderately jingoistic 1980s-style action throwbacks more reminiscent of the works of Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme than they are the above-the-title efforts of Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone (not that there's a ton of difference between them all). They showcase a form of unbridled masculinity that almost feels passe in today's current political and social environment, their aggressively virile intensity unsurprisingly not going to please everyone. Not going to lie, the first two movies have kind of started to grow on me over the past few years, the crazy, messed-up and absurdly gory London Has Fallen in particular.

Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) strives to exit a multi-level, bullet-riddled structure as squadrons of soldiers descend upon his position. But thanks to his skills, he's perfectly capable of overcoming the incredible odds  or at least that's what the overwrought editing will have audiences assume. In this opening sequence alone, the camerawork is so shaky and hard to follow that it's impossible to know exactly what is going on. Back in Washington D.C., Banning awaits an offer to become the Director of the Secret Service for President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). But despite his many years on the job, working to protect the President from all sorts of mayhem, Mike isn't certain he's ready to sit behind a desk for the rest of his career. His abuse of pills for migraines, dizziness, and insomnia doesn't help in making the decision, though his wife Leah (Piper Perabo) and their infant daughter Lynn would probably appreciate the less intensive promotion. Meanwhile, longtime friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), who runs a private military contractor company called Salient Global, could use Banning's assistance in securing training deals with the U.S. Department of Defense (for which troops have been stretched thin due to so many ongoing international conflicts). ""You're a disaster waiting to happen,"" a doctor cautions Mike, whose dizzy spells only seem to afflict him during the beginning of the film, and never in the midst of an action sequence. It's fortunate that this condition doesn't interfere with Mike's ability to subdue much younger, better-equipped opposition, or even the equally matched Jennings, whose shadiness right from his introduction couldn't be more obvious. It also has no influence on his reaction time when the President's fishing trip provides an opportunity for an assassination attempt  utilizing drones, the go-to, hi-tech weapon of modern thrillers  which is blamed on Banning after the FBI discovers some damning evidence. ""My husband is a good man."" From the dialogue to the frame-job, ""Angel Has Fallen"" sticks to a predictable formula, following the underdog as he's turned into a fugitive who must solve the mystery of the attack in order to clear his name. Disappointingly, plenty of time-wasting events are chronicled, including such bland formalities as the swearing in of the Vice President (Tim Blake Nelson), the FBI's forensic investigation and the no-nonsense Special Agent (Jada Pinkett Smith) in charge of being mean to Mike and Leah, and even the security sweeps and procedures governing the Secret Service members. It's one man against the world, managing to elude everyone  good guys and bad guys alike  despite his age, his injuries, and his lack of sleep, food, and painkillers. Circling back to the frenetic editing and cinematography at the start, ""Angel Has Fallen"" presents its most pathetic scene when Mike fights inside a car at night.

Every subsequent film is significantly worse in quality, and yet here we are, on part three of sucksville. Angel, for those not keeping track, is the third film after Olympus and London Has Fallen. We are back in the shoes of modern day John McLaine Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who must once again save the president of the US from a terror attack. This time, to throw in something new Banning is framed, and the entire secret service is after him because they think he is the one who wants POTUS dead. If you have been brought up on a diet of thrillers in the '90s, you will be reminded very quickly that this film is very much like The Fugitive. In fact, there is a moment in the third act, which is exactly like a moment in the finale of that movie. But if this was intended to be a homage, it is quite a mediocre one because at no point does this movie thrill or surprise  everything is so stale and cold you wonder how this film managed to time travel a couple decades. There is no focus on pacing, or an element of well earned revelation, or any ingenuity in delivering suspense, or even a modicum of well constructed action thrills  the whole thing is a dumb meathead of a movie that just drones on for far too long, and shows you something that is two hours too late. It is, however, designed for a particular kind of audience  the one that loves pulpy actioners that put the president in danger  and on that front this is a very well-oiled machine. Morgan Freeman plays the POTUS in a believably compassionate way. Butler is flexing his biceps, jumping into lakes to save him is only going to to render MAGA boners to audiences who dig this stuff. Butler's 'investigation' is also treated in a predictably over-dramatic manner, which culminates in a ridiculous man-to-man fight with the bad guy  which is only going to make those who love this franchise clap real hard. The odd thing is this is the only movie in the trilogy that features acceptable acting performances, so all the corny plotting is swept under the rug. There is little else to recommend or talk about in this film because it is such a big ball of nothingness. It does, however, make you question why Butler's career trajectory, which began with a bang in 300, is now reduced to this junk.

228,RPX_Doc8_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX_Doc8_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX,Action,Negative,Angel_Has_Fallen,"The sleepy, dopey action bonanza ""Angel Has Fallen"" is disappointing, and not just for the reasons you might expect. Being the second sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" ""Angel Has Fallen"" doesn't even have a high bar to clear. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was a by-the-numbers revenge-fantasy about ruthless North Koreans and emasculated, savior-thirsty Americans that's mostly distinguished by its considerable displays of over-the-top violence. Basically, America is graphically imperiled for the sake of confirming a slogan coined by then-interim President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman): ""As a nation, we are never stronger than when we are tested."" ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is, at the very least, a credible survivalist wet dream. In that movie, America is (temporarily) made great again, but only after the Washington Monument is toppled, the President is tied up, and the Secretary of Defense is punched in the face and kicked in the belly, right before she's dragged across the floor as she defiantly screams the Pledge of Allegiance. To defeat the North Koreans, Banning does what no officially sanctioned US agents can: he kills a bunch of bad guys without any remorse or reprisal, like the North Korean hostage that he shoots in the head, just to spook the other North Korean agent he has tied up (""Your friend seemed like a funny guy""). ""Olympus Has Fallen"" isn't a good movie, but I couldn't stop watching it. By contrast: I couldn't wait to stop watching ""Angel Has Fallen,"" an indifferently assembled cash-in shot with way too many shaky, unfocused close-ups which seem designed to re-assure viewers of this otherwise bland drama's surface-deep intensity. Being a timid lament about contemporary American trust issues (the Russians are to blame, but almost incidentally), ""Angel Has Fallen"" sics Banningnow rickety from concussion-induced migraines and insomniaon a group of disloyal American mercenaries led by, well, you'll figure that part out soon enough. The makers of ""Angel Has Fallen"" don't seem to care as much about their characters (or patriotic ass-whoopings) like their predecessors did. Instead, we get a few tentative signs of introspection from Banninghe's sick, has a family to protect, and an estranged dad, too!that are immediately glossed over for the sake of pumping up a few flat set pieces that hail from the Tony Scott School of Frenzied Action Filmmaking, only they're not as dynamic or good-looking as Scott's jittery photography. If you're going to be mean-spirited and exploitative, at least do it convincingly. The makers of ""Angel Has Fallen"" struggle most when they have to make Banning look like a rebel who also knows that he must inevitably ""ride a desk"" to retirement. Their version of Banning is more like John McClane in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" than in ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder."" He complains (and periodically shows symptoms) of the action-movie equivalent of PTSD, but never succumbs to those ailments, especially not when he needs to cut through handcuffs, light up a phalanx of armed mercs, or run away strategically. This is apparently what life is like"

You go into every movie hoping for the best. You want to be entertained or moved or feel some sort of emotion, even if it's an unpleasant one. Based on how little I enjoyed its predecessors maybe Angel Has Fallen was a case where I should've abandoned all hope at the door. I didn't hope for much, but I got what I expected: a terrible, incompetently made action movie that's so boring and cliched it would've put me immediately to sleep if it wasn't so loud and obnoxious. Surprise, surprise, the POTUS (this time played by Morgan Freeman) is in danger yet again, this time as a result of cancelling the contracts of private sector mercenaries-for-hire in war zones. Special Agent Mike Banning (Butler) is once again the President's most trusted protector, but he has problems of his own. He has a wife (Piper Perabo) and young daughter to care about now. His past adventures have left him a painkiller popping mess, with severe spinal damage and post-concussion syndrome. He's thinking of transitioning into a desk job as the director of the Secret Service. Before that can happen, however, some soldiers of fortune try to take out the president with a massive drone strike during a fishing trip. Banning saves the president in the knick of time, but the leader of the free world is left in a coma, and every other agent on site has been killed in the massacre. Coming to in the hospital after getting knocked out, Banning finds out that the FBI agent (Jada Pinkett Smith) investigating the assassination attempt is arresting him for the crime, after notcing that millions of dollars has just been dropped into an offshore account in his name from a Russian source. Knowing that he's been set-up by a former friend (Danny Huston) keen on landing some cushy government contracts by any means necessary, Banning breaks out of custody in a bid to clear his name and stop the people behind the kill order from finishing the job on the president. Directing duties this time out are handed off to stuntman turned director Ric Roman Waugh (Snitch) and the minimal script of cliches and tiresome speeches about personal freedoms is attributed to Waugh, Matt Cook (Patriot's Day, Triple 9), and Robert Mark Kamen (the original The Karate Kid, The Transporter), working from a story by series creators Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. Nothing tends to surprise me anymore, so I'm not taken aback by how it took a total of five people to write something that a team of trained monkeys could turn out in about an hour  way before they ever got around to writing their masterpiece  nor"
230,RPX_Doc10_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX_Doc10_Angel_Has_Fallen,RPX,Action,Negative,Angel_Has_Fallen,"Ric Roman Waugh's Angel Has Fallen sees U.S. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler)having returned to his home turf after a trip across the pondcontending with more threats to international security. Mercifully jettisoning the Islamophobia of Babak Najafi's London Has Fallen, the film finds Mike framed for an assassination attempt on President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). And clearing his name appears to hinge, at least at first, on whether or not he learns to grapple with the physical and psychological toll of his previous exploits, as multiple concussions and spinal injuries have saddled him with insomnia and an addiction to painkillers. As a fleet of miniature drones slaughters Trumbull's security detail, it's impossible not to think of Mike's early interactions with his old Army Ranger buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), the head of a private military contractor. Angel Has Fallen introduces Wade openly lamenting that Trumbull's efforts to stop war profiteering have hurt his business. It's almost to the film's credit that Jennings's guilt is never in doubt, meaning that Mike's subsequent escape from custody and quest to clear his name are rooted solely in his having to contend with his traitorous friend's private army, and not some dull mystery centered around who set him up. Still, the film's framing of Mike as the most wanted man in America is clumsily executed. Given that his face is plastered on screens all over the country, you'd think that the man would be trying to avoid public exposure at all times. In practice, though, Mike is almost always in plain sight, never making any attempt to disguise himself, almost as if he's aware that no one ever seems to recognize him. The only exception to this rule is when he's held up by two armed, backwoods militiamen in Angel Has Fallen's most baffling scene; after all, when one imagines the sort of people who might be driven to an outraged citizen's arrest over an attack on a liberal, black president, one doesn't immediately think of white nationalists. Given the lack of significant impediment to Mike's movements, the film allows plenty of space for action thrills, but Waugh seems to have cobbled his set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection. And because of so much coherence-defying shot continuity, it's impossible to tell what's happening during any given skirmish. Even the nonviolent scenes are jittery and aggressive; a close-up at one point tracks a character picking up a phone with a whip pan so fast that the shot slips out of focus. Worst of all, though, are the special effects that mark the more grandiose set pieces, with smoke from massive explosions hanging statically in the air as a giant, solid mass and, in the film's rooftop climax, the obvious use of green screen revealing image artifacts around the actors' faces. It doesn't help that, three films into the Fallen series, Mike has almost paradoxically lost some of his dimensionality as a character. In an age"
231,TDI_Doc1_Orphan,TDI_Doc1_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Positive,Orphan,"For some reason the 2009 psychological horror film ""Orphan"" slipped completely by me. Not only did I not see it during its original release, I don't remember even hearing about it. In fact, it wasn't until the announcement of its recently released prequel and its subsequent good word of mouth that I was actually aware of its existence. That's crazy for me considering that ""Orphan"" wasn't some obscure, minuscule budgeted, straight-to-video release. Even more baffling, it stars two acting talents I really enjoy  Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard. To prep for its prequel, I finally sat down with ""Orphan"". It's directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (""Jungle Cruise"", ""Black Adam""), written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (""Aquaman"", ""The Conjuring 2""), and co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio (???). As mentioned, the film stars Farmiga and Sarsgaard playing a struggling couple who adopt a young girl to help cope with the loss of their own child. Needless to say, things don't quite turn out as they had hoped. Kate and John Coleman's marriage is at a critical point following the stillborn loss of their third child, Jessica. Kate (Farmiga), a recovering alcoholic, is finding it harder to resist her urges to drink. And the couple can't seem to rekindle the intimacy they once had before losing their baby. After much consideration, Kate and John (Sarsgaard) visit St. Mariana's Home for Girls and adopt 9-year-old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Esther is exceptionally bright, well-mannered, and artistic. But she's not without her eccentricities. For example, she dresses as if she's been yanked from another time period. And what's with that old Bible she keeps hidden in her sock drawer? She immediately hits it off with the Coleman's 5-year-old hearing impaired daughter, Max (Aryana Engineer). But their jealous 12-year-old son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) immediately dislikes the new family addition, and the tension between the two only intensifies. ""Orphan"" is one of those movies where the audience knows the angle from the start. We know something is off with Esther and that nothing good is going to come for this family. So it's all about watching it play out and waiting for the truth about Esther to be revealed. In some films like this, that can be maddening. But kudos to Collet-Serra and Johnson-McGoldrick for creating characters we can connect with and care about. From there the task is to create atmosphere and build tension, something Collet-Serra does very well. The film is really helped by strong performances from Farmiga, Sarsgaard, and Fuhrman. Farmiga gets the meatiest and most complex role while Sarsgaard is a sturdy scene-sharer. Both find layers of humanity in their characters especially as their family dynamic starts to crumble. In the meantime, Fuhrman is a steadily unnerving presence, and she only gets creepier as Esther's malevolence grows. It's a wickedly effective performance. So it took me a while, but I finally got around to seeing ""The Orphan"". I'm glad I did. It's a fun, preposterous, and at times chilling horror thriller that's more interested in the"
232,TDI_Doc2_Orphan,TDI_Doc2_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Positive,Orphan,"After seeing ""Orphan,"" I now realize that Damien of ""The Omen"" was a model child. The Demon Seed was a bumper crop. Rosemary would have been happy to have this baby. Here is a shamelessly effective horror film based on the most diabolical of movie malefactors, a child. Pity. Esther is such a bright child. So well-behaved. Her paintings are so masterful. She sits down at the piano and rips off a little Tchaikovsky. So why does her adoptive mother have such a fearful attitude toward her? Could it be because after her arrival, Kate, her new mom, got drunk and almost let her son Daniel drown? Had Max, a darling daughter, but then miscarried a third child? Is an alcoholic trying go stay sober? Just doesn't like the little orphan girl's looks? There is something eerie about her. Something too wise, too knowing, too penetrating. And why won't she remove those ribbons she always wears? And why does she dress like Little Bo-Peep when she goes to school? Daniel is cool toward her. Max is too young to be sure. Only John, the father, is convinced she's a bright kid, and blameless in a series of unfortunate events. Vera Farmiga is at the film's core as Kate, a onetime Yale music professor who feels she is unfairly targeted by her therapist, her husband and eventually the authorities. Peter Sarsgaard is John, the kind of understanding husband who doesn't understand a damned thing except that he is understanding. And Esther, the orphan, is played by Isabelle Fuhrman, who is not going to be convincing as a nice child for a long, long time. ""Orphan"" hinges on a classic thriller device: the heroine who knows the truth and insists on it, even though everyone is convinced she's mad and wants to ship her off to rehab or even a mental institution. It's frustrating to know you're right when no one can see the truth you find so obvious. Things happen around Esther. A child falls from a playground slide. A car rolls down a hill. A nun comes into harm's way. Esther spreads disinformation. She's secretive. And sometimes she's so perfect, you want to wring her neck. When it turns out the orphanage has faulty info on Esther's Russian origins, Kate starts sniffing around in what her husband dismisses as paranoia. ""Orphan"" begins like your usual thriller, with Scare Alerts and False Alarms. You know, like a nice, peaceful shot until suddenly the sound blares and something rushes past the camera and  hey, it's only kids. We even get the old standby where Kate is looking in the medicine cabinet and closes it and ohmigod!  there's another face in the mirror! But hey, it's only her smiling husband. Sarsgaard is well-cast in the role. He looks normal, sounds pleasant and yet can suggest something a little twitchy. Not that he's evil. Simply that he really should trust his wife more. Really. How the movie handles the other children, Daniel"
233,TDI_Doc3_Orphan,TDI_Doc3_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Positive,Orphan,"Dark, edgy, twisted, effective, clever, intense, and blackly comic - one of the best ""evil child"" films I've seen. It's brilliantly cast - Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are top-notch as usual, but what really stood out where the natural performances director Jaume Collet- Serra was able to get from the child actors. Usually child actors are painful to watch, but 12- year-old Isabelle Fuhrman gives a terrifying, chilling performance that is worthy of praise. Aryana Engineer in her screen debut as the deaf little sister Max is adorable and almost steals the show in every scene. The stylish cinematography, editing, and sound are fantastic as well. I saw Orphan at a packed advance screening and the audience had a blast. Collet-Serra knows how to pull the strings and engage the audience, as they were screaming and laughing at all the right moments. There are plenty of fun and playful tension-relieving scenes, and several cathartic moments when the audience erupted into cheers. When the credits rolled the audience even applauded. The second showing I went to was just as receptive - the audience went nuts. They were collectively screaming, cheering, yelling at the screen, cringing, applauding, and enthusiastically welcoming the comic relief. One guy commented afterwards: ""I never get scared by movies but that was the scariest movie I've ever seen."" Audience participation for both screenings I went to were very high. The film improves upon second viewing, with the knowledge of the twist. I was able to focus more on details and clues, and the anticipation of my favorite scenes made for a much more rewarding experience. It's even more chilling and cathartic the second time around. It's far from perfect though - there are way too many predictable jump/false scares, with the soundtrack blaring to try to startle the viewer. The last part of the movie becomes a slasher flick replete with cliches and a one-liner. There is a talky scene where Esther reveals herself to her adoptive mother that is totally unneeded, as well as a crucial line regarding Danny, the older son, which really should've been cut. It's also a bit long at 2 hours - for an exploitative ""B"" movie this is unusual, although time is devoted to character development. Esther is multi-dimensional and even sympathetic at times - I would love to see a prequel based on her character. Orphan is definitely not for kids - aside from the ""anti-adoption"" angle, there is plenty of dangerous imitable behavior. The violence committed by and toward children is shocking, realistic, and brutal. This is a ballsy film that throws kids into horrific ordeals. It may be a ""B"" movie, but it's a damn good one that knows its audience. The basic idea is nothing new (except for the unexpected twist), but you knew that from the trailer and synopsis. If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some cliches and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills,"
234,TDI_Doc4_Orphan,TDI_Doc4_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Positive,Orphan,"""Orphan"" was a movie that truly did surprised me. I mean I came into this movie honestly not having any idea which direction it would take me, I mean sure it looked good, but then again the 30 second previews made it seem a bit mediocre. When the movie went off I was very pleased by what I had seen. The things I love most about Orphan is how they present and introduce these characters so well. The minute I saw the main couple I couldn't help but take a liking to them, and Esther who very easily steals the show, is incredibly likable. As a matter of fact the thing I do love a lot about the film is how they take their time in the story, I loved how for the first half or so you see Esther adapting to her new surroundings, and I became extremely indulged into this. I also think they balanced out the character of Esther well. I mean this performance, and character, could have easily been portrayed as this over-the-top, annoying, non-intimidating, and non-believable character, but not once do you ever feel that. Also it is very entertaining, and you're hooked from the moment you see this little girl Esther. It was also clever at times, to where you feel a sense of danger as far as the story goes because it's literally like anything can happen. Even if does begin to make you mad for whatever reason, you still can't help but keep watching and wondering. At times it may feel predictable, but they've already presented these characters so well, that you can't but feel that maybe you haven't predicted it. I will say I wished ""Orphan"" HAD paced itself a little better, I mean they don't immediately jump into the story, but when they do it feels rushed and as if they fear the audience won't care about the characters, when it's not true. Also towards the end the characters start to lose liking, so much so that I couldn't help but look at these characters(in particular the mom and dad) and say ""Who are you, and why are you being such an unlikable stereotype!"" As a result of the characters acting stupid and stereotypical at this point in the film it just became predictable to an extent where you knew what was going to happen. Last you know I don't know how I felt about the twist, it was done well enough to where it would fit the storyline, but I feel it defeats the shocking, brutal, and thrilling nature of the film. Anyways, overall ""Orphan"" is one of the better thrillers you'll probably see this year, and even if you're not too big on these kind of films, I still recommend ""Orphan"
235,TDI_Doc5_Orphan,TDI_Doc5_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Positive,Orphan,"I didn't know much about this film before seeing it, but the write-up did intrigue me slightly so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a little too long for my liking, but quite well made if a little cliche in places. I guess I should have done a little more research, but then again I have uncovered the odd 'gem' this way in the past. But I digress; let's have a look at what Orphan is all about. Kate and John Coleman have just lost their baby, a daughter they were going to call Jessica. She was dead at birth. Needing something to fill the void, they decide to adopt. By the way, they already have two children, a boy, Daniel, and a girl, Max, who is partially deaf and uses sign language to communicate. The family are comfortably off and live in a big house in the countryside. Visiting an orphanage, John meets a nine year old girl called Esther. She is originally from Russia and is delightful. He convinces Kate that she's the one and they bring her home a few weeks later. Unfortunately Esther is not what she seems and the Coleman's are in for a very bumpy ride as she sets about her plan for them. I'm not going to say any more on the plot, I believe that should be enough to intrigue you. Although it was very well made I did have a bit of a problem sympathising with the Coleman's. It seems they have everything going for them in terms of lifestyle, job, financial security etc., but somehow that isn't enough for them. It's not as if their characters come over as particularly nurturing either, Kate a recovering alcoholic and John has been known to have a roving eye in the past. But if you can get past all that there's a pretty creepy story behind it all. Decent performances all round, particularly from; Vera Farmiga as Kate, Peter Sarsgaard as John and especially from Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, she was particularly creepy. Also worth a mention were; CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail, Jimmy Bennett as Daniel and Aryana Engineer as Max. Putting aside my incomprehension of the reasons for the Coleman's wanting to adopt, I did find the film quite disturbing. Esther particularly so, the way she manipulates situations and how she's always listening in is quite unnerving. As I said at the beginning, it is a little cliche in places and it is way too long but over all quite a sinister tale (glad I watched it in daylight!). Finally a mention for the guys who do the opening and closing credits, very cleverly done IMO, nice work. I guess over all it's recommended, but only just."
236,TDI_Doc6_Orphan,TDI_Doc6_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Negative,Orphan,"This movie frustrated me so much I spent a good portion of it yelling at the screen. Yes, I was being a screen ranter all by my lonesome (I would never do that with other viewers around). To begin with, the movie is about a ""girl"" named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who is in an orphanage. After she's adopted by Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) it becomes readily apparent that she had some serious issues. To be frank, we knew she had issues before the movie started, that's why we watched. It took no time at all for Esther to start exhibiting signs of psychopathy. And that was a source of two problems I had. Problem 1: Esther's psychopathy being missed. Esther slipped through all the cracks and was able to get adopted with completely false information. It turned out she had a long history of violence and destruction with no history of orphan care, yet that was all covered up. Problem 2: Esther was playing chess when everyone else was playing checkers. Esther was a Mensa level sociopath. The way she was able to ""adroitly"" manipulate everyone and get away with all kinds of mayhem up to, and including, murder, was astonishing. Even Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder), who facilitated the adoption, had to admit that Esther was conveniently close to many ""accidents."" I was insanely bothered by how she had an in-depth knowledge of so many things which all allowed her to be a better psycho. I kept audibly saying, ""There's no way a nine-year-old girl can know this much, or much less, operate at this level."" No matter how loudly I called BS on Esther's behavior she continued on being the Einstein of psychos. She even brazenly let on to her wickedness to Kate, daring her to stop her. And because this movie was poorly written Esther was able to continue her reign of terror. The main reason she was able to keep up her act was Kate's husband John. He was so thoroughly fooled by Esther you had to question his sanity. This led to the third problem I had. Problem 3: John's readiness to leave Kate for the new addition. The fact that John was ready to leave his wife for an orphan girl who just joined the family a month ago was mind-boggling. Even IF Kate was imagining Esther's manipulation, it says a lot that her husband was ready to choose the newly acquired ""daughter"" over his wife. How fragile was their marriage? But I guess I shoulda known that a Peter Sarsgaard character was going to eventually be a weasel. As the movie progressed, we find out that Esther is not a little girl, but instead a thirty-three-year-old woman with a hypo pituitary condition that keeps her looking like a little girl. That did explain how she was as cunning and intelligent as she was, but that's all it explained. It didn't explain how none of her crimes led back to her nor"

The movie starts out like your typical dark psychological thriller, including the painfully cheap scare tactics of a squeaky medicine cabinet that isn't scary. I just hate when directors think it's a good idea to do that, because it's such a cop-out cliche from real fear. The bird kill was actually extremely well done. I went step-by-step on the DVD and it just looks so real. Bravo. The biggest fault for me is the unbelievability. Scene after scene of evil little girl actions and everyone is just sooo oblivious it gets very frustrating- Especially the dad, get a clue! Whom, also, is obviously gay. I read up on it and it seems he's married to Maggie Gyllenhaal with a child but still, that doesn't mean he's hetero and his speech and movement are real giveaways. I am certainly not saying that there is a problem with being gay, but the character calls for a straight family man and so in that way I felt it was distracting since most of time his homosexuality just seems so incredibly obvious. Anyway, after the nun from the orphanage is killed, that should have been a dead giveaway that OK, something is NOT RIGHT. but still the evil continues and obliviousness ensues. As for her death, the CG blood was a little distracting and there could have been more fury, so overall not too exciting. The grandma, a bitchy woman who only appears in a couple scenes, also really could have benefited from a creative death scene. When the mom finds dad in a puddle of his own blood, (nice stabbing death) she seems very underwhelmed. Your loving husband has just been murdered and you only sit by his side for a moment to grieve and then take off never to return. That's just unnatural. She showed more emotion in all of her other dramatic scenes and this was the most dramatic of all! The real saving grace in this movie is Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther. I don't think they could have gotten anyone better. Perfect casting. She is so manipulative and believably evil. The twist at the end is original and very clever and it WORKS! After seeing her brush off her make-up and change her clothes, you really believe she is a 33-year old psycho dwarf! She really makes the movie worth watching. The ending was a disappointment. Mom delivers that cliche one-liner, which actually may have worked if it wasn't pronounced as loudly and with such dramatic pause. That just made it so cheesy. And this is followed by a CG neck break which just makes me groan in disappointment. Why is that even needed? It would have been much better to have the mom kick her real hard in the face and have her neck slam backwards and watch her bloody face slowly submerge into the water below. The movie isn't bad, but it"
238,TDI_Doc8_Orphan,TDI_Doc8_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Negative,Orphan,"Evil kid horror movies are nothing new and have been a staple for at least 50 years. The Exorcist, Children of the Corn, The Omen, The Children have all tackled the idea for generations, and there is a long standing precedent of the audience being ""in"" on the premise way before the characters in the film is, and the premise usually works due to the creep factor of an ""evil kid"". However, 2009's Orphan plays to that trope quite a bit without actually introducing any of the ""creep"" factor. In fact, it feels much more like a thriller than it ever does a horror flick for most of the 2 hour run time. I remember watching this back in theaters with my best friend while he was going through a divorce (as a good friend, I was the guy who went out to movies with him and had him hang out so he could get through it, so there were a LOOOOOT of films that I saw back in 2009-2010) and promptly forget abut it, only to get re-reminded when 2022's Orphan: First Kill got released. Now Scream Factory has gotten the rights from Warner Brothers and re-released the aging 2009 WB Blu-ray with a new 2K remaster, and plenty of new extras to go around in a nice collector's edition. As I said above, ""evil children"" flicks are pretty simple at heart, though Orphan gives it a novel new twist that adds some mild enjoyment to the rather stale horror movie. In the aftermath of a tragic event, parents Kate (Vera Farmiga) and her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard) decide that it's time to get back on the horse and adopt a child rather than try a painful pregnancy again. They find their little angel in the form of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) at a local orphanage, and she seems to really hit it off with Peter. She paints beautifully, she's sweet, and seems to get along with their young deaf daughter. However, Esther has plans of her own. Soon after arrive she begins to manipulate the parents and children alike, and her own back story gets called into question. At first only Kate (a recovering alcoholic) starts to see the darker side the Russian girl, but soon the other children get pulled into her web of lies, deceit and violence and it's not long before even Peter comes face to face with a monster hidden by the face of a child. Honestly, Orphan is not the best horror movie, but it's a decent enough thriller if you don't have something better to watch. The real twist comes from a nifty sleight of hand with Esther herself, but is also a one trick pony as well (as the 2nd film pretty obviously showed when I reviewed it 2 years ago). On the surface it looks good for plenty of creepy moments, when in reality there are VERY minimalist creep factor going on. That being said, the film as a thriller actually"
239,TDI_Doc9_Orphan,TDI_Doc9_Orphan,TDI,Horror,Negative,Orphan,"Where to start. Psychological horrors rely on believable characters. Peter Sarsgaard on the other hand was one of the most unbelievable characters from a film I've seen in a long time. It wasn't his fault but his character was a moron, pure and simple. After everything that had happened around Esther, and there was an awful lot, he still sided with her over his other children and wife. For somebody who was an architect how he could not put two and two together is beyond me, and for all his stupidity deserved to die. For those that liked The Orphan I really don't know how one could look past this, he was that unbelievably. Their two children baffled me as well. Perhaps they were scared, but after everything that they knew and saw at least one of them would have mentioned something, but The Orphan would have fallen at the first hurdle had they done so. The seduction scene. Esther turned out to be a 30-something in the film however Isabelle Fuhrman wasn't. I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination but I thought this scene was totally unnecessary and the film could have ended up in exactly the same place without the additional plot that she murders her foster families once the father spurns her sexual advances. Credit should be given to Vera Farmiga, I thought she did put in quite a good performance and was one of the very few positives that came from the film. To it's credit the twist in the film was one of the more clever twists I've seen for a while although once it was revealed the rest of the film was very predictable, but it certainly wasn't the worst ending I've seen. The stupidity of the father was bad enough but the whole adoption process was by far the worst part of this film. I don't know much about how it works but I'm pretty sure they would carry out backgrounds checks on a child before a family adopts her rather than after. The Sister only seemed to make a few phone calls to find out that there has been a lot of violence surrounding Esther, and only a little more research from the mother uncovered that she escaped from a mental institution in Estonia. For a film that needs to be believable it makes a total mockery of itself. Another issue I had with Orphan was it's pacing. At times it seemed to really drag out and I on occasions found myself having to resist giving up watching it, but on the grand scheme of things this didn't change my opinion of the film that greatly. I've been very critical of Orphan but the framework for a good film is there. A lot could have been done with the story but it felt like they had the initial idea and the twist planned out and just made up the rest as they went along to get from A to"

Well, being as I love all things ""terrifying"" I sprinted toward the opportunity to watch this one. Maybe a casual stroll would have been better! Okay I'll say this much-the movie actually wasn't THAT bad. Having said that however, I personally didn't find it too amazing either. The first two things that came to mind with this film and could have pretty much served as deal breakers were: 1. The very last line is clearly stolen from the Ring 2 and the situation in which it appears is also way too similar (In fact,the whole evil girl with questionable history thing has been done in an all too similar fashion enough times by now..) 2. The whole movie is basically like a mishmash of The Ring, The Good Son and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. Like literally I kid you not. Now, It did occur to me that maybe I was being a bit harsh to overly judge the movie purely based on these facts. And so I decided to forget that I had seen this all before and look the movie in it's own merit and individuality. Not so easy though sadly. The characters seemed to stumble their way through the entire movie, switching personalities every five minutes to suit the scene changes. Hints such as the ""cheating"" husband, seemed raised in the moment for drama but then they just vanish from the plot line as soon as they are mentioned. This is frustrating and leaves several unanswered questions that would have been usefully wrapped up by the end if not before. Take for example, a revelation that the mother is apparently a recovering /recovered alcoholic. In the scene where she has it out with the therapist, hubby goes from being this exceptionally loving husband, having had a few niggles with his wife-to suddenly pulling an emotional 360 and completely turning on her. To the point she's locked up. The same dude then somehow inexplicably immediately then allows himself to get totally steaming drunk while Left in the care of his two other children and Esther. He is infact so super hammered that almost gets seduced by Esther. You know, the ""child"", who is suddenly wearing a flirty modern day grown up outfit and shed loads of makeup. And no one sees anything a tad, a miss. The family took a huge leap of faith when they didn't even think to fully wait for Esther's history to be revealed before adopting her. Like, who does that? And allowing an alcoholic who was jailed for neglect adoption rights? As for Esther, she was examined by a Doctor. How on earth did they not know, she was not a 9 year old child? Esther of course turns out to be extremely violent and dangerous. Having herself been sectioned in a mental institute after killing her old family. Again this"
241,TLU_Doc1_No_Time_to_Die,TLU_Doc1_No_Time_to_Die,TLU,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"In this deeply edifying final installment of Daniel Craig's long run as James Bond, there's a surprisingly tender-hearted farewell to the 007 we've known for over a decade. With a near-epic running time of nearly three hours, No Time to Die certainly moves at a clip, sweeping along at a thrilling pace from bulletproof Aston Martins to poisonings in Havana nightclubs to ex-Soviet bunkers, and all under director Cary Fukunaga's stylish eye. A series of action setpieces, from Bond's makeshift bungee jump off a crumbling bridge to his effortless hijacking of a motorbike, are filmed with breathtakingly dynamic roving cameras. During a romantic Italian holiday, we first find Bond summering with Dr Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux, expressive and capable, the antithesis of the 'Bond girl'), the woman he loves but who has an enigmatic history. Naturally  this being Bond  the idyll can't last long; imposing and mysterious threats are soon closing in from all sides, usually in the form of men with knives in their teeth and grenades to lob. Phantoms emerge not only from Bond's own past, but from the pasts of many of his closest allies and friends. Meanwhile, Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), 007's greatest enemy and head of the shadowy Spectre, is up to no good. Another baddie with an axe to grind makes himself known in the form of Safin (Rami Malek, forbidding and self-contained), an enormously creepy foe with a penchant for bio-warfare. No Time to Die is a movie not only obsessed by its characters' personal histories, but by its own; it has every inclination to wear its homages to the series on its Brioni sleeve, from its frequent musical interludes (they never get old) to its rather surprising choice to bring back the Sixties-flavour Bond quip (these sometimes do get old). But the film really soars when it is smartly combining the old with the new, as with the introduction of new MI6 agent (Lashana Lynch, a commanding, though still thoroughly supporting presence) who has been granted the '007' number during Bond's temporary retirement, much to his displeasure. Also new are the movie's too-much-of-a-coincidence parallels to current events, begging the question of what additions, rewrites, or otherwise may have been happening during the film's long release delay; it is hard to misunderstand the significance of a biological weapon that makes a person most harmful to their closest loved ones. The topical gambit works a treat: the choice feels considered and surprisingly heartbreaking, making literal the secret agent's sense of dislocation from the ordinary world around him. As for Craig himself, he casts a long shadow for the would-be future 007. The whole film runs on his cold drollness and ice-blue stare; you get the sense that this is a person (Craig) and a character (Bond) who always knows precisely what he's doing. This granite slab of a man has been a rough and tough 007 rather than a super-slick one, but here the lone wolf really does display softness. Producers Barbara Broccoli"
242,TLU_Doc2_No_Time_to_Die,TLU_Doc2_No_Time_to_Die,TLU,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"Last September, Daniel Craig's swan song as James Bond was finally released after being held back nearly two years due to the global pandemic, making its title, No Time to Die, more than a little ironic. Directed and co-written by former UCSC slug Cary Fukunaga, No Time to Die is now available on home video just in time for the movie icon's 60th anniversary. That's six decades of Bond girls, Bond cars, Bond gadgets, Bond villains, and bad Bond puns. It's hard to believe, but it's been sixteen years since Daniel Craig first slipped into 007's tuxedo, and he's aged into the role beautifully. His debut as the ultimate spy in Casino Royal marked the first time the action franchise made an effort, however small, to modernize the series by broadening gender and racial representation, playing down Bond's misogyny, and playing up the character's psychological complexity. Craig, arguably the most talented Bond performer since Sean Connery, expresses more than just determination, anger, and self-satisfaction. He has deeper feelings  often conflicted. He's even capable of love. No Time to Die is an exciting final chapter for Craig's Bond, even though at close to three hours long the story does suffer from a little fat around the midriff. The same can't be said for Craig, who could easily compete against Brad Pitt for best male upper torso in the over-50 category. No Time to Die starts off with one of the most thrilling pre-credit sequences ever, and, clocking in at over twenty minutes, it's hands down the longest. There's a frightening home invasion that provides a backstory payoff later in the film, three death-defying stunts, and a car chase involving Bond driving the DB5 Aston Martin made famous in Goldfinger, complete with embedded arsenal, culminating with a nail-biting moment when it looks like bullet-proof glass won't be enough to save him. After the obligatory CGI-animated title sequence, accompanied by a disappointingly lethargic Billie Eilish song, the story picks up five years later; Bond is enjoying his retirement from MI6 in Jamaica, even though his enemies, old and new, are still at work. Christoph Waltz, in a scene straight out of The Silence of the Lambs, reprises his role as Blofeld, the ultimate puppet-master. A new threat comes in the form of Lyutsifer Safin, played by Rami Malik. Safin, with his creepy voice affectation and equally creepy complexion, is a fun throwback to classical bond villainy bent on upending the world order. Suffice to say, it doesn't take long for Bond to become reacquainted with his trusty Walther PPK. Bond sequels have always recycled elements from its predecessors. But No Time to Die, the 25th film in the franchise, reaches back half a century to borrow almost exclusively from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Many Bond aficionados consider it one of the best in the series, if not THE best, so the filmmakers could do worse. Nonetheless, pilfering so many ideas, and even the musical cues, from one particular film may be"
243,TLU_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,TLU_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,TLU,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"It's the end of an era. After starring in 5 movies over the last 15 years, English actor Daniel Craig is done with James Bond. No Time To Die is Craig's final Bond outing, his swan song in many ways, as these 5 movies have connected with storylines playing out across each of them. And this final one wraps things up as best it can. Years ago when they rebooted with Casino Royale, Eon Productions decided to try making the new Bond movies with ongoing narratives. Almost every other movie before this era was just a standalone movie: Bond would go off on his important mission, take out the bad guy and save the day; everything would start fresh again with the next movie. Ever since Casino Royale in 2006, Bond has been dealing with the guilt and sadness of losing his great love, Vesper Lynd. And with this fifth movie, they've put themselves in a situation where they have to tie up all the loose ends and usher all these characters to a satisfying end point. What I've learned over the last 15 years of watching Bond movies is that everyone has a different experience with Bond. Some people grew up watching Sean Connery and prefer his style of Bond movies. Others never enjoyed the old Bond movies and only got into this new series when Casino Royale offered something different. Some people, like me and a few of my friends, are huge fans of all of the original Bond movies, yet recognize that Bond has evolved. The goofy, over-the-top ridiculous Bond of the Roger Moore era is fun, but not something that really works anymore. For me, the Daniel Craig era has been hit or miss - I love Skyfall the most, I enjoy Casino Royale, I don't like Spectre much, and Quantum of Solace is fairly forgettable. But this is just my connection with the series, and everyone has their own experiences with it. Meaning everyone will like or dislike No Time To Die on their own terms, no matter what critics or fans say. Nonetheless, it's definitely better than Spectre, and does its best to introduce new ideas while finishing up with Craig's Bond. It also seems Eon Productions wanted to explore different evolutions of Bond beyond No Time To Die. For many years, fans have been hoping that they'll cast a Black Bond or a Female Bond next time. It's clear they wanted to try both of those in this movie - Lashana Lynch co-stars as an MI6 agent named Nomi. When the movie begins, Bond is officially ""retired"" and no longer works for them anymore, so they've replaced him and MI6 has moved on. She plays an important role in the story because she's the asset that they send out instead, and eventually she meets Bond (who she is certainly aware of) and begins working with him for the rest of the movie. This happens very early on and isn't so much of a"

Fifteen years and five movies later Craig wraps up his terrific run with the 25th installment in the James Bond franchise, ""No Time to Die"". Due to several reasons (a global pandemic chief among them), we haven't had a Bond film since 2015. That's a long time, but I'm happy to say it was well worth the wait. I was pretty lukewarm on James Bond movies until Craig came along. His first entry ""Casino Royale"" blew me away. I like his second film, the flawed ""Quantum of Solace"" more than most. I loved his third movie ""Skyfall"" but was more mixed on his fourth, ""Spectre"". With ""No Time to Die"", Craig is given the chance to end his tenure on a sky-high note. And boy does he. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, ""No Time to Die"" comes packaged with everything you want from a Bond movie  big action, even bigger characters, plenty of style, and a special dash of heart. But Craig's movies have added grit to that list. His Bond carries the weight of loss, and his pain often pushes him outside the bounds of agency protocol. That emotional burden and his willingness to cross the line are traits that set his 007 apart from all the rest. This near $300 million sequel comes with a collection of old familiar faces as well as a few new ones. And once again this latest world-saving mission takes Bond (and us) to locations across the globe  Italy, Jamaica, Cuba, Norway, and of course London. And then you have the story itself which is not only thrilling blockbuster material, but it nails the tricky task of completing Daniel Craig's story arc. And it does it in an profoundly satisfying way. The film begins with James having retired from MI6 and enjoying what resembles a normal life with Madeleine (a returning Lea Seydoux). But while on a romantic getaway in the exquisitely shot Matera, Italy, the couple are reminded why they're always looking over their shoulders. Assassins sent by the nefarious crime syndicate Spectre ambush James leading to an exhilarating action sequence through the heart of the scenic city. Bond and Madeleine manage to escape, but he suspects her of betraying and the two split up. Five years and one Billie Eilish Bond theme later, James is living in seclusion on a beach in Jamaica when he's contacted by old friend and CIA field officer Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Felix needs Bond's help tracking down a kidnapped scientist (David Dencik) who has developed a DNA-targeting bioweapon known as ""Project Heracles"". Obviously, in the wrong hands the bioweapon could be catastrophic. And those hands happen to belong to Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a soft-spoken yet vengeful terrorist leader who has an axe to grind with Spectre and has a rather gnarly connection to Madeleine's past. And just like that, Bond"

But do not fret; Craig's last outing as the debonair MI6 agent is heavy in spectacle and action, proving that it can stand the test of time not only with these most recent Bond flicks but within the pantheon of the 007 films as a whole. No Time To Die opens like many Bond films, capturing the audience's attention with mystery, intrigue and murder. A young girl witnesses her mother being killed by Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), and in her attempt to escape, Safin spares her life. This is the beginning of Madeleine Swann's (Lea Seydoux) story and is just one of the many secrets about her life that Bond (Craig) doesn't know about. We then catch up with Bond, enjoying his retirement alongside Madeleine. The inseparable pair are enjoying their time together, but it isn't long before their pasts come back to haunt them. Of course, we all have our secrets. However, what will all of the deceit mean for James, Madeleine, and the lives of those around them? You will just have to watch No Time To Die to find out. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, No Time To Die holds nothing back. In terms of action, it is just as exciting as its predecessors and will likely leave audiences elated. Fukunaga does a great job with his direction, and the cast certainly leans into everything they're given with ease. From the beginning to the end of No Time To Die, Craig's love of the character is felt. Although, there is no mistaking that this is Craig's final outing as the beloved agent. He pours his heart and soul into his performance, giving something almost operatic that ends with a cacophonous crescendo that is very well-deserved after spending so many years in the role. Despite this being a goodbye to Craig's Bond, No Time To Die introduces audiences to new faces and what an impact they make! Lashana Lynch enters the film with intense charisma as Nomi; she easily rivals Bond himself. But that is the point, considering she is the newest 007 at MI6. Lynch and Craig have great chemistry together, constantly aware of one another, making for some entertaining moments where the pair try to one-up the other. Another new introduction to the franchise is Ana de Armas as Paloma. Much like Lynch's Nomi, de Armas's Paloma is outstanding alongside Craig's Bond, and the duo joins forces to make one of the film's most eventful and impactful scenes. Brief as her appearance may be, her presence leaves a lasting impression. As does Nomi, who is deserving of her own set of adventures if MGM would be so gracious. While this is a movie about Craig's Bond, showcasing some new and exciting characters for his final adventure, it would have been nice to see some of the other characters who've aided Bond throughout these films get their proper send-offs"
246,TLU_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,TLU_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,TLU,Action,Negative,No_Time_to_Die,"Cary Joji Fukunaga's No Time To Die is heavy-handed from the first scene, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) and his love-interest, Madeline (Lea Seydoux) glide across Europe like the protagonists in an Imtiaz Ali movie. Except there's no song playing in the background which underlines their 'free spirit' ways. As they enter (what looks like) a town in Italy, she teases him for looking over his shoulder. He denies it, and says something profound about the 'past'. We see locals burning tiny pieces of paper, which we're told are past regrets and secrets, as a ritual. Craig's Bond has been marinating in distrust and trauma since that climactic betrayal in Casino Royale, something that has arguably worked splendidly for the franchise, rooting it in real-world opacity. And to Craig's credit, he embodies the stiff upper-lipped Mi6 agent to perfection, instead of being the one firing zingers in every scene. Which is why it's shocking that the No Time To Die makers saddle him with melodramatic lines like ""We all have our secrets, we just didn't get to yours yet."" But then again, that's probably the 'pitch' of Fukunaga's film. Now, only if they had shown more conviction to deliver a sappy finale for Craig's final outing as James Bond. It's troubling how little No Time To Die does to separate itself from its predecessors. It's just another bloated Bond film, with call-backs from within the Bond franchise (since Craig got on board), 'exotic' landscapes, a supervillain with a God complex nursing genocidal ambitions. ""Just another day,"" Mallory tells Bond in one scene. There's the wry British humour on display, the umpteen close-ups of alcohol being served in a glass often gulped within seconds. Even the action scenes, though impressive in the moment, aren't particularly memorable like the parkour scene in Casino Royale. There's no weighty grief in the way Bond nurses a broken heart in Quantum of Solace, and surely none of the bitterness or existential dread from Skyfall. Far from bearing Fukunaga's signature on it, No Time To Die seems like a dish that the director cooked up from a bullet-point recipe using each of the studio executive's favourite ingredients. Some humour? Add some of Ana De Armas and Daniel Craig's playful chemistry from Knives Out . Some action? Let's blow things up - a street in Cuba, a sailboat, or even an island. Some 'progressive' posturing? Let's get Lashana Lynch as the new 007 to impress the liberals. The decision really does feel that shallow, especially the way they handle Lynch, characterising her as someone chasing her own tail based on Bond's leads. The treatment meted out to Lynch at least answers the question about whether she is going to be trusted with the franchise. Nope. ami Malek, sporting a Noh mask and spotted skin, isn't nearly as creepy as his plain face in Mr Robot. Playing a character, who is an odd mix of Russian and Japanese heritage, means Malek gets ample room for his homegrown eccentricities."

It's so much movie that one hardly knows where to begin. So let's start with the runtime, which carries on for 165 minutes. Long movies don't deter me, assuming the time is well spent, but this one felt overstuffed. Director Cary Joji Fukanaga, the first American director to helm an entry in the franchise's 60-year history, gives the audience plenty to contemplate, and not all of it feels essential or necessary. Fukanaga and his posse of screenwritersincluding Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridgeconcoct a script chock full of elaborate plotting, drearily murky characters, and weighty themes. These writers have much to do, crafting the final Craig entry. Their screenplay must weave together the narrative threads from the last four movies, starting with Casino Royale (2006). They must consider the series' clandestine evil organizations and strained relationships, both personal and professional. At the same time, the audience expects rousing action sequences, death puns, and daring spycraft. Plus, unique to No Time to Die is a sense of closure and finality to the Craig run, ensuring that its star never has to return to the franchise he love-hates. As I mentioned, it's a lot. Devoted fans of the franchise will eat up this hardy helping of cinematic comfort food with a delirious smile, content that the filmmakers have planned a glorious final chapter for their hero. After nearly two years of delays due to the pandemic, the fact that we're seeing the movie at all seems like something that might've never happened. But here we are, and boy howdy, is it a lot. It's not merely the latest spy-actioner in the series; it's a sprawling and contemplative movie about the baggage we carry. Early in No Time to Die, Bond and his new lover from Spectre (2015), Madeline Swann (Lea Seydoux), vacation in the Mediterranean. She wants him to say goodbye to his past, namely Vesper, the femme fatale who broke his heart in Casino Royale, and only then will Madeline share her past. This is a movie obsessed with the past. Its characters have been scarred and remain unable to move beyond their histories. Eventually, Bond comes to terms with Vesper and her betrayal, but in doing so, he finds reason to suspect that Madeline works for the super-secret villain club, Spectre. Since he can no longer trust her, Bond leaves Madeline and retires to a beach in Jamaica. Five years pass, meaning the characters have stewed in their unresolved conflicts for half a decade. But their issues with the past go further back as well. In a pre-credits scene, a preadolescent Madeline finds her childhood home in Norway attacked by a masked man, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). To exact revenge for his family's murder, Lyutsifer wants to kill Mr. White, who is Madeline's father and the baddie from earlier movies, but he'll take White's wife and child instead. After"

This latest chapter in cinema's most enduring and beloved espionage series, which also is the swan song for Daniel Craig after five turns as British secret agent James Bond, merely hints at reinventing the character and mythology without fully committing to it. Under the direction of American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation), the Bond films  now 25 and counting  continue to raise the bar in terms of visual extravagance, even if this installment lacks the substance to match the spectacle. Easing into the obligatory elaborate opening set piece  in this case, a harrowing chase involving thugs through narrow streets and stairwells in a quaint Italian village  the film generally dials back the action in favor of enhanced emotional depth and complexity, bolstered by Craig's debonair charm. After the titular Billie Eilish ballad, the film proceeds to check off all the franchise staples, including the catchphrases, music cues, exotic locales, near-death escapes, alluring women, cool cars, high-tech gadgets, and recurring characters. His latest globetrotting saga of international intrigue finds Bond navigating the usual maze of deceit and betrayal, even among his own ranks, with the personal stakes higher than ever. Lured off the beach and out of retirement by an old CIA colleague (Jeffrey Wright) for a low-level investigation, he becomes ensnared in the latest villainy from Spectre. Meanwhile, MI6 has moved on without him, including a dismissive M (Ralph Fiennes), who already has given a young agent named Nomi (Lashana Lynch) his old 007 moniker. Still, it becomes apparent that Bond's expertise is vital as ever, particularly when confronting old nemesis Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) in prison, or tracking down the vengeful Safin (Rami Malek), an expert in bioweaponry whose terrorist plot ties into Bond's ongoing relationship with scientist Madeleine (Lea Seydoux). While piecing together clues, Bond is forced to confront his past and contemplate his future, such as whether the suave yet stubborn agent needs to evolve with the world around him. The convoluted screenplay delivers a sturdy adventure with some suspenseful twists, witty banter, and modest thrills. However, it lacks a memorably fleshed out villain, despite Malek's menacing portrayal. As it builds toward an inevitable final showdown, No Time to Die becomes more content to go through the motions. If we've learned anything in the last six decades, it's that when Bond is on the case, the outcome is never really in doubt."

For the makers of these movies world domination is an ambition fulfilled a long time ago. The trick nowadays is to maintain their iron grip on the hearts and minds of the viewing public. For a franchise that began in 1962, which has now clocked up its 25th entry, the most difficult moments arrive when new actors are introduced to take on the roles of familiar, beloved characters. Some of these characters have been replaced several times over, including the central figure of Secret Agent 007. Sean Connery, the original Bond, who appeared in the role officially on six occasions is still widely regarded as the best. Roger Moore would make seven appearances, and Pierce Brosnan four. Aussie George Lazenby made only one film as James Bond before leaving of his own volition. Timothy Dalton quit after two movies and has hardly been heard of since. With five appearances spread out over 15 years Daniel Craig has played Bond for a longer period than any other actor, imprinting his image on the minds of a generation of viewers  viewers conditioned by social media to have the shortest attention spans in history. So when Craig announces that the new Bond, No Time to Die, will be his last, it sets up a huge buzz of speculation. Will they kill him off? Will they reveal a successor? And for the actor himself, is there life after James Bond? One suspects he'll come through more successfully than Lazenby or Dalton. The knowledge that this will be Craig's last fling exerts an influence on the way the plot unfolds, and the way we view the film. It's not an entirely happy influence because it makes the action seem more than usually mechanical, and allows little scope for other characters to develop convincing personalities. Over an epic span of 163 minutes, director Cary Joji Fukunaga has given us a fast-moving entertainment that won't disappoint the majority of fans, but it's one of the most dramatically uninvolving of Bond movies. The story is all about planet James, with everyone else relegated to the role of satellites. Because this planet is on an inexorable trajectory towards oblivion, every sequence plays out as one more step on the path to the final revelation of Bond's fate  which is easy enough to predict long before the credits roll. This feeling sets in gradually as the film progresses. The pre-titles sequence is spectacular, beginning with a creepy flashback to Madeleine Swan's childhood, as her snow-bound family chalet is invaded by a crazed killer. Next we're with Bond and Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), on holiday in the picturesque Italian town of Matera, where they are waylaid by a group of murderous villains. By the time the reliably amazing titles appear, we're on the edge of our seats. As the story progresses we slide back into the comfy chair. Suddenly it's five"

The Craig years have been a bumpy ride; the promising but bloated Casino Royale, the paper-thin Quantum of Solace, the all-time high of Skyfall, the messy doldrums of Spectre, and finally No Time To Die. The problem, as with Star Wars and most other franchises is, the longer it goes on, the more you realise that they're just making it up as they go along. Things start brightly with some retconning; we're introduced to previous relationship Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) and as soon as she blurts out 'there's something I've been meaning to tell you,' we know that she's pregnant and that Bond now has a daughter and a family to protect. This protect-your-family motivation is contrary to Bond lore, but it helps that the notion is cannily dropped in the middle of a stylish Aston Martin chase through an ancient Italian town; the disguise just about sugar-coats the contradictions. A second set piece, a fire-fight in a Santiago night-club for Blofeld's birthday party, also lands well, but things start to fall apart with the introduction of the new young, black and gifted female OO7 (Lashana Lynch); James Bond has retired after all. Over an hour of inane, static chat then follow without Bond even picking up a gun; we eventually unite Bond with his family in Scotland, but off-the-shelf baddie Safin (Rami Malek) is still waiting on his island lair with plans to annihilate the world, and all that dark foreshadowing can't really go for nothing. No Time to Die can't really be faulted for the action scenes, which are terse, well-realised and technically superb. But the key element of humour is missing; Phoebe Waller-Bridge was drafted in to pep the script up, but sophistication is MIA, with gags that would elicit groans in the Roger Moore era. The new 007 drops down onto a dance-floor, shoots an assailant and quips 'Mind if I cut in?' Cringe. Even the serious-minded Skyfall stooped to double-taking underground passengers for cheap laughs, but the tired one-liners here take away from the big reveal; spoiler alerts, James Bond finally gets killed. That should be a big deal for a 20th century icon, but after besting so many adversaries, to see Bond bite the bullet at the hands of a no-mark villain who cuts around in his dressing gown is a whopping anti-climax. And it's painful listening to the new and old 007 squabbling about who should have the title; they sound like toddlers in a playground, but the familiar punchline is that the uppity woman gets slapped down.

251,TMC_Doc1_Equilibrium,TMC_Doc1_Equilibrium,TMC,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"A tedious rip-off sci-fi film, itching to be another Matrix (or, maybe just a bearable flick!), that brazenly steals everything from Orwell's 1984 novel and many other thinking man's films, with the same Dystopian agenda, such as Fahrenheit 451. It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I've seen this film's theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre! Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995-""One Man's Justice""), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998-""Sphere,"" the 1999-""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and the 2003-""The Recruit,"" never got this 'baby' off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state: ""Without love, breath is just a clock ticking""), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of cliches from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It's a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression). Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he's a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called ""Gun-Kata"") going on missions to root out all rebels who haven't taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he's also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge's expected fate is as doomed as Preston's wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner ""I spread my dreams under your feet."" Before you can say 'let's burn some more books' all of the following things happen to Preston: he's given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be"
252,TMC_Doc2_Equilibrium,TMC_Doc2_Equilibrium,TMC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"Equilibrium is my favorite movie of 2002. It feels uncomfortable even typing those words, as they sound like the typical soundbite blurb-speak that passes for so much of film criticism these days. But it's true: This medium-budgeted, futuristic action tale that arrives on screens with precious little fanfare is, to my mind, the best film I've seen all year. It's a movie that thrilled and moved and deeply affected me when I got the chance to see it at a very early advance screening last July, and hasn't been out of my mind in the months since. I've been heaping praise on it for so many months  to friends, colleagues, family...pretty much anyone who'd listen  that it almost feels like I've written this review already. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has delivered an intelligent and honorable riff on such science fiction classics as George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, presenting a not-too-distant future where freedom has been traded for security (a timely subject these days!) through the State-mandated use of emotion-suppressing drugs. War and crime and hate are things of the past in Equilibrium's world, but so are art and creativity and love. This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father, and enforced by a quasi-religious order of ""Clericks,"" whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on ""sense offenders"" who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile. A terrifying future, to be sure, though not one without hope  especially when Clerick John Preston (Christian Bale, a much more impressive action hero here than he was fighting dragons in Reign of Fire) accidentally misses his drug dose and begins to feel for the first time. I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of Equilibrium, jammed as it is with surprise and invention  suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit. Though the film gets immeasurable mileage out of its cinematography, stunning futuristic production design, and music (an awesome neo-Wagnerian choral score by Klaus Badelt, a frequent collaborator of Hans Zimmer), it's (not surprisingly) the performers who give the proceedings so much gravity. Bale has never been better, combining the sleek coldness that served him so well as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho with a heartbreaking portrayal of a man rediscovering his lost humanity (and paying for the recovery of that humanity: Wimmer cleverly has the violence become more intense and wrenching as Preston learns to feel again). Bale is strongly supported by Emily Watson (one of the most soulful actresses working today, here perfectly cast as a beautiful sense offender who spurs Preston's rebellion against the system), Taye Diggs (having a wicked good time as Preston's suspicious partner), and Angus MacFadyen (sinister and oddly mournful as the head Clerick). This is a cast who seem to be giving their all in"
253,TMC_Doc3_Equilibrium,TMC_Doc3_Equilibrium,TMC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"If I was to explain this movie to someone in one sentence it would be this: ""George Orwell meets John Woo"". I thought about Orwell he'd probably approve of this film. The center for which all the soldiers come from is called ""Equilibrium"" or balance as it is layman's terms; they're all injected with an opium drug that they carry that numbs their emotions and sense of guilt while they're controlled by the heavily armed heavily secure government facility. Paired with incredible direction and writing by Kurt Wimmer and sleek stylish cinematography by Dion Beebe, we're given a glimpse into a world that's still imperfect despite it being under control. In a society now completely void of emotion, heavily armed guards patrol the streets with the use of their skilled warriors called the Grammaton Clericks, a band of sleek swift emotionless soldiers who can take on a horde of rebels without breaking a sweat. Their best soldier is Sean Preston, an emotionless professional and violent soldier who one day remembers his wife whom he betrayed to be killed for feeling and now his memories begin flooding back as well with his emotions after he betrays his partner Partridge (Sean Bean) who he discovered with a book. Now, as his memories come back and emotions emerge, he must keep his emotions in tact while attempting to help the rebels and stay one step ahead of his eager young partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) a soldier almost equal in skill and abilities who is anxious to discover his secret and further his own career. The soldiers sit in a stadium where they're fed messages from the high father who watches over Libria, and everyone is monitored for emotions ala ""1984."" Those found with contraband including books, records, literature or art are killed and then the contraband is properly burned ala ""Farenheit 451"". It's obvious by looking at the facility that the government doesn't have much faith in their process as they watch everyone, including their best soldier Preston. He himself is plagued with traces of emotions and his haunting memory of selling his wife out to the authorities causing her death all the while hiding his emotions from his colleagues and his young son who is also being tailored as a clerick and watches him like a hawk as well. Christian Bale portrays a warrior without emotion, a warrior who kills without mercy and then must slowly progress into a man who's emotions are slowly coming back to him and express his realization towards those emotions, and Bale handles it with impressive range and incredible depth. Diggs play well against Preston as his rival constantly monitoring him and attempting to outdo him while Preston must stay one step ahead of him in his struggle with his emotions. There are many memorable scenes in the film, some utterly fantastic, and some fantastic for being so simple. Wimmer, obviously a martial arts movie buff creates some incredible and stylistic action sequences with the help of"
254,TMC_Doc4_Equilibrium,TMC_Doc4_Equilibrium,TMC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"Pilfered though it is from many superior (and not-so-superior) sources, Equilibrium has a lot more to offer than you'd expect. Dimension Films (the genre branch of Miramax) sat on it for over a year before finally dumping it into a paltry 301 screens in a December death slot against the big year-end films (i.e., The Two Towers and its like). It didn't even get a chance to make back its relatively low $20 million budget  it grossed just over $1 million before disappearing from theaters in three weeks. The movie deserves far better. Equilibrium is not the most original movie to come down the pike  it's indebted to your choice of dystopian science fiction (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, The Matrix, Gattaca)  but it's a sleek and forceful film of its kind, with some of the most eye-boggling gunfight scenes in recent memory. They're not even gunfights  they're more like systematic gun massacres, begun and finished in an eyeblink, with shooter and targets close enough to kiss. John Preston (Christian Bale), a ""Grammaton Cleric"" (i.e., assassin for the government), does far more shooting than kissing. John is one of the black-clad enforcers of the new world order: in the post-WWIII fascist state of Libria, it has been determined that war and violence can be blamed solely on emotion, so all emotions have been outlawed. Scruffy bands of resistance fighters, who have refused to take their daily dose of the emotion-killing drug Prozium, gather together to appreciate art, music, film  contraband works of beauty (which are illegal because they inspire feeling). John is a complete moral and emotional blank, which means he's the best at his job, and his two children, raised (like him) on a steady diet of Prozium, are likewise empty. John was married once, but his wife became a ""sense offender,"" rebelling against the emotionless world, and was summarily executed while John stood nearby, not bothered in the slightest. Such a man could never carry a movie if there weren't a change of heart  or, in John's case, an introduction of heart  in store for him. Christian Bale plays the early scenes almost as a sequel to his dead-zone Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, as if Bateman had finally found his niche as a callous destroyer in the bleak world of Libria and was handed a badge and a gun. But little by little, emotion invades his shell. His partner Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the poetry of Yeats; John neutrally pulls Partridge's plug, but with the tiniest flicker of doubt (""I'll do what I can to see that they go easy on you,"" he says, an odd sentiment for someone supposedly without sentiment). Later, John drops one of his Prozium capsules, but instead of getting a replacement, he begins to have feelings. Some viewers may complain that John, conveniently for the plot, has an emotionally tough day ahead of him the same morning he goes Prozium-free; but he may"
255,TMC_Doc5_Equilibrium,TMC_Doc5_Equilibrium,TMC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"The movie is set in the 21st centuryhey! that's our century!at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His. Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend. Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feelswell, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id. If ""Equilibrium"" has a plot borrowed from 1984, Brave New World and other dystopian novels, it has gunfights and martial arts borrowed from the latest advances in special effects. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that the form of battle used in the movie is ""Gun-Kata,"" which is ""a martial art completely based around guns."" I credit Nunziata because I think he may have invented this term. The fighters transcribe the usual arcs in mid-air and do impossible acrobatics, but mostly use guns instead of fists and feet. That would seem to be cheating, and involves a lot of extra work (it is much easier to shoot someone without doing a back-flip), but since the result is loud and violent it is no doubt worth it. There is an opening sequence in which Preston and Partridge approach an apartment where Offenders are holed up, and Preston orders the lights to be turned out in the apartment. Then"
256,TMC_Doc6_Equilibrium,TMC_Doc6_Equilibrium,TMC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"I bought Equilibrium just because Christian Bale is in it. To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. It takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality. The movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. The government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be ""sense offenders"" on the spot (""I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?""). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. For the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like. Many people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The"

Now normally, I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos. On my trip through the parking lot, I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it. Then proceeded to speed home, so I could take an extremely violent crap. I don't know what was worse; how painful the bowel movement was, or how painful the movie was. Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4. As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to track him down and force-feed him his review. Laced with Strychnine. I realize you're probably thinking, ""Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?"" But frankly, I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture. I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie, so I guess I should make an attempt. Then again, if I put as much effort into this review as writer/director Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay, I could call it a day right now. ""Equilibrium"" gives us a society, Libria, which is opiated by a drug known as Librium, a necessity after World War III. The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war, and in order to prevent any such future occurrences, they constructed a society based on emotionless. This is aided by the destruction of all art, music, and cultural relics, not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection. Those who forsake the drug are known as ""Sense Offenders,"" and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by ""tended to,"" I mean ""Terminated with extreme prejudice."" Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've encountered Clerick John Preston, watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender, and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier. But thanks to his Librium doses, he doesn't seem to mind much. Watching this movie, I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good. All is well and good in emotionless Libria, until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink, and doesn't have time to pick up another dose. Suddenly, he is overwhelmed with emotion, and continues to abstain from his medication, leading him to question authority and rebel. And by ""rebel,"" I mean ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of, ""At this point, the movie degenerates into a Matrix-wannabe."" Unfortunately, the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders. Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity, from the slicked-back black hair, black garb, and generally emotionless acting ability. Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance, given the fact he was on the drug, he"

Somebody tries to the best of their abilities with the budget they have and brings a project to a completion. That's respectable. But this lazy Matrix wannabe with bad CGI, the incredibly childish ""gun katta"" fighting, and a ridiculous premise makes me angry and sad that Sean Bean and Christian Bale took their time to star in this, when they could've been making better movies. These kinds of cash-grabs do make me angry. But at least such movies usually get panned by the public and we never hear anything about them ever again. The fact that this thing received positive reviews from the public made me think that either I saw a different film than everybody else or this world needs to be set on fire, along with the modern film industry, if this kind of garbage is going to be an acceptable standard for entertainment from now on. Let us start with the plot: in the future feelings are illegal. Turn this s**t off right now. You can just turn it off right there. What else do you need to know? How can anyone in their right mind still proceed to watch something when the main idea is so insultingly stupid? How can you believe a single thing shown on the screen with that as the back story? Here is a better premise I just came up with: in the future people only have one leg and must touch a pickle every 24 hours with their left index finger so that Hollywood executives can keep getting paid for artistically bankrupt content. Who keeps coming up with this stuff? Does someone get paid for it? Can I join in on the scam? If you manage to get past this, then what you get is a cheap looking Matrix rip-off, mostly a stylistic rip-off but the story is not that different either if you think about it. The protagonists are wearing jackets they fished out of the bin outside of the Matrix Reloaded studio and are carrying Desert Eagles as their weapons of choice - you know, those giant pistols you see in Pamela Anderson's productions and other 90's direct-to-video action movies showing up on your TV at 1AM in the morning. I bet the actors were happy with that stupid premise though, because it means they can all be emotionless, you know, because that is why they get paid large amounts of money, to look like a wooden plank with guns attached.

It's set in someone's zany idea of a future totalitarian state where guys in black leather are burning all the poetry but haven't gotten around to picking up the machine guns yet. As Keanu Reeves might say, whoa! Boasting a handsome if over-digitized production and a bevy of male beauties as central characters (there's a big cheekbone thing going on here), the movie has evolved at least one degree from the dystopian broodings of Orwell. That is, its central conceit is based on antidepressants that weren't around in Orwell's day. In this future, it is law that every day in every way, every citizen must take an injection of the drug Prozium, which reduces humankind to an efficient if narcoticized half-life. In exchange for this miasma of stupor, the folks do enjoy freedom from crime, aggression, jealousy and all those other messy attributes of what is called the Human Condition. But writer-director Kurt Wimmer takes this intriguing idea a little too far and ventures off into Cloud Cuckooland: Since art stirs feelings, art (including poetry, drama and  mein gott!  movie criticism) is banned. Thus the reigning stud-pups of this future are an elite security cult, called Clerics. In obedience to ""Father"" (the movie's dim-bulb simulation of Orwell's horrifying Big Brother) they raid underground crypts and out-of-the-way apartments where heavily armed dissenters still bliss out on the Mona Lisa and Andy Warhol's soup cans and the poetry of noted revolutionary Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The plot proper turns on the adventures of Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale, cheekbone rating 9.8), who is a kind of mythically effective killing machine charged with blowing away Gerard Manley Hopkins readers with AK-47s. He's so efficient that he turned in his own wife for elimination, having detected certain deviant fondnesses for, I don't know, Hermann Hesse or something. But one night, after an especially hectic day of rat-tat-tatting perverts and art mavens, he forgets to take his Prozium and those horrible messy tidal waves called emotions  guilt, love, pain, regret, sentimentality  come over him. He regrets frying his wife, and his former partner (Sean Bean, cheekbone rating 9.1) and, like the great Winston Smith before him, begins to develop his own set of deviant impulses. At the same time, his ambitious new partner (Taye Diggs, cheekbone rating 9.3). is beginning to suspect him. Then, in Plot Twist 18, he's falling in love with revolutionary poetess Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson, cheekbone rating 4.2) and, eventually (Plot Twist 37), consorting with a revolutionary leader (William Fichtner, cheekbone rating 765.9). Busy, busy, busy. To make it busier, Wimmer has conceived the clerics as having Zen-like close combat skills; they can dodge bullets by undulating in slow motion, they can unleash stylized karate mayhem like Hong Kong stuntmen, they can shoot with scientific precision anything that holds bullets.

First major league directorial project for scenarist Kurt Wimmer misses with its blowhard treatment of a silly, obvious script. Results might hazard ""Battlefield Earth"" comparison if new pic were a tad more fun. Nonetheless, there are unintentional laughs here, ones most likely to be picked out by fantasy fans in a home-viewing future that looms far more immediate than pic's vision of tomorrow. Requisite opening text-crawl-plus-windy-voiceover informs us that once again, World War III has happened, wreaking such devastation that survivors have surrendered all control to the Grammaton Cleric, a mysterious authority whose strictures are designed to prevent WWIV. He/it has determined that man's inhumanity to man is fueled by his ability to feel. Hence everybody's on heavy doses of Prozium, which makes them think and behave in a neutral, obedient fashion. Subsidiary clericks like top-of-class John Preston (Christian Bale) are trained to intuit signs of sense offenses, thereby ferreting out persons who read books, look at paintings, listen to music, hide pre-Grammaton memorabilia, go off medication, or otherwise dare forbidden emotions. Offenders are invariably executed; one such was Preston's own wife, some years ago. The occasional nostril twitch suggests he perhaps wasn't as hunky-dory with that event as he claims, though grade-school-aged son Robbie (Matthew Harbour) appears to be developing just fine into a droning little fascist-snitch. It's unclear just how much of civilization is left, or even if there are other cities outside pic's Librya. There are pockets of illegal dissent beyond town limits, however, in a zone known as the Nethers. John & Co. are frequently dispatched there to break up radical cells and torch their verboten booty. In a sequence that sets the somber-silly tone, ""Equilibrium's"" first such raid uncovers  wouldn't ya know it  the original Mona Lisa! To which blowtorch is immediately applied. When his clerick-ing workmate commits suicide rather than be exposed as a Yeats-reading sense offender, John gets a new partner. Brandt (Taye Diggs) is a by-the-book squealer who immediately suspects Preston of harboring illicit ideas. Indeed, protag has stopped taking his Prozium, and is fishing about trying to join the resistance. Still keeping up the good front, he regretfully takes part in the bust of free-thinker Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson, utterly wasted in just a few scenes), who sees him for the sensitive soul he's secretly becoming. In this supposedly far-advanced society, plot holes are widened by the apparent nonexistence of bullet-proof vests or phone call tracing. Among numerous absurdities is Mary marching like Joan of Arc (or a volcano-sacrificed jungle virgin) to her sentenced doom, an event prompting Preston to declare, ""She's scheduled for combustion!"" Or a final digitized robo-t'ai chi-fu face-off between hero and chief nemesis (Angus MacFayden) that looks a whole lot like patty-cake. Much of the ultimately-inspirational nonsense is drenched in"

While most of the kids from the Loser's Club have moved out of Derry, Maine, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa/Chosen Jacobs) has remained. Haunted by the events of the past, he keeps ever vigilant for IT's possible return. When mysterious disappearances begin occurring once again, Mike reaches out to his childhood friends to remind them of their promise to return to kill IT once and for all. I am happy to report that IT Chapter 2 is a worthy sequel to the first film, and in some ways even better. Bigger risks are taken, the violence is more unhinged and effective, scenes get more abstract and dreamlike, and it carries a surprising emotional weight. The film deftly jumps from present to past and back again thanks to a nimble script by Gary Dauberman and clear direction from Andy Muschietti. This necessitates employing the younger performers from the first film along with a new ensemble of expertly cast adult actors. The effect is consistency in character that adds a unique gravitas to the collective performances. We are first reintroduced to all of the Losers as they get the fateful call that pulls them back to their painful childhoods in Derry and the film begins. All but one of the Losers immediately hop onto planes and return home with the exception of Stanley (Andy Bean/Wyatt Oleff). Once back, the Losers meet for dinner at the Jade of the Orient. Each of the losers arrives and sizes one another up in their own way. Beverly (Jessica Chastain/Sophia Lillis), Bill (James McAvoy/Jaeden Martell) Richie (Bill Hader/Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (James Ransone /Jack Dylan Grazer), and Ben (Jay Ryan/Jeremy Ray Taylor) sit at a round table, reconnecting until a lingering feeling of dread takes hold again. As they all slowly recall the evil they faced 27 years before, Mike attempts to convince them that it is their obligation to stay, confront the evil, and defeat it for good. The initial response is to run, screaming into the night and never look back. After a bit of convincing, they all realize that the only way to fight fear is to confront it. Dauberman's script goes to great pains to include the rich mythos of IT as an ancient, cosmic creature that has tormented the area for hundreds of years without sacrificing narrative momentum. The film even goes so far as to touch on the local Native Americans tactics in facing off with the creature and how that could help the Losers. Saddled with their marching orders, each adult Loser heads off to seek a ""token"" to be used in a ritual that will destroy IT for good. As this plays out, Pennywise lets the Losers know he is aware they have returned. This leads to one particularly effective scene of Beverly returning to her childhood home only to"

He calls everyone from the losers club, including Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), and Ritchie (Bill Hader), and summons them back to Derry, where they will all face Pennywise for a second, and hopefully final, time. It Chapter Two is a film with a lot on its plate  so much in fact that it doesn't really know what to do with it all. But there are elements of substance to its somewhat messy presentation. A fruitful theme that can be derived is that of past trauma and coming to terms with it. All of the losers club members who have left Derry each return with amnesia, having forgotten Pennywise and his horrors, their memories being hazier the further away they have gotten from Derry. Mike is the only one who remembers clearly, acting as a guide through their past experiences. As such, these characters are forced to confront their dark pasts both directly and suddenly. One could argue that conquering your fears is a trait of the genre, regardless of age, but because we're dealing with fairly experienced adults instead of naive children, the film at times feels more like a trip through an obnoxious carnival hall than journeys of personal growth. All of the actors work with the material well too. On top of being perfectly cast as aged versions of the actors from the previous film (in spite of some uncomfortable de-aging CGI on the child actors), each one feels committed to the ideas the film seems to inhabit. McAvoy and Chastain both encompass their characters' shared and individual horrors excellently, as does James Ransone as Eddie, resulting in vulnerable portrayals of broken people. But, much like Finn Wolfhard before him, Bill Hader steals the show as Ritchie. Both very funny, and very sincere, Hader creates maybe the most intricate character of the film. His performance is articulate and layered, achieving tension and even heartbreak. Unfortunately, the film sacrifices the coming-of-age element that made the first one so distinct. Two of my friends and I were in the pub the other day, and we were discussing how accomplished Stephen King is as a coming-of-age writer. The Body (aka Stand by Me) is a perfect example, and even earlier"

Andy Muschietti's first It film was a huge commercial success, but made quite a few changes from the novel that did not entirely satisfy. Its take on the demonic clown Pennywise, a character still dominated by Tim Curry's theatrical performance in the 1990 miniseries, was rather too horrific and bleak, while a shift in setting from the 1950s to the 1980s felt a poor fit for Stephen King's original novel. A reduction in Mike's role in the narrative also hurt the film somewhat, weakening the story's sole person of colour for no easily justifiable reason. It: Chapter Two is set in the present day, and adapts the second half of King's lengthy novel. ""It"" has returned, and as the last remaining member of the Losers Club still living in Derry, Mike calls and begs his childhood friends to return. This sequel did not gain the popular audience or acclaim that its predecessor did, but personally I find it a much stronger film. With the benefit of age the protagonists have much more depth to them, and a strong cast of actors do an exceptional job of fleshing them out and showing how each has changed and developed in the intervening years. Particularly strong is Jessica Chastain  one of the USA's best contemporary actors  as Beverly: still a victim, but still fighting to escape a legacy of violence. Bill Skarsgard brings a much more comfortable and light tone to Pennywise, warming up the character to an extent and in doing so pulling away from the relentless horrors that made him difficult to believe in last time around. Clowns are naturally creepy characters  more so in the 1980s than the 1950s  and a screaming demonic monster as a clown made a mockery of the idea it could ever tempt a child into harm's way. This revised iteration is funnier, and more subtle where it counts: finally a temptation for which you can believe a child would fall. Stylishly shot, well paced, and overall very satisfying, It: Chapter Two feels like a strong improvement, and a solid slice of commercially-minded populist horror. It is imperfect in places  the climax struggles a little, and an early scene of two homosexual men being assaulted feels tonally misjudged  but overall it satisfies in a manner that the original film did not quite manage. Still, as a two-part re-opening of the Stephen King adaptation for business  there have been six new Stephen King film adaptations since It with 10 in development  it acquits itself remarkably well."

On the plus side, each movie completes multiple character arcs in more or less satisfying ways, understanding that for all of the expensive special effects being displayed on screen, the main quality that makes or breaks a film is whether or not we care about the protagonists. Each one also has an iconic villain at the center of its story, although the baddie in ""It Chapter Two"" is horrifying, while Thanos of the MCU is intended to be more of an intimidating ""final boss"" archetype. Finally each movie, despite the roughly three-hour running time, feels lean; neither drags or feels padded out, but keeps moving along at a brisk clip. On the less flattering side: Each movie works better on an emotional level than a logical one. Picking up where 2017's ""It"" left off, ""Chapter Two""  again directed by Andy Muschietti  tells the story of seven adults who have suppressed traumatic memories from their childhoods in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. They are of course forced to confront them when an evil supernatural clown threatens to murder innocent people. Advertisement: As readers of King's novel will know, the cast of characters is extensive. It includes Bill (James McAvoy), a successful writer who had to overcome a debilitating stutter as a child; Richie (Bill Hader), a stand-up comedian whose vulgarity is revealed to be motivated by a secret character trait that serves as one of the film's plot twists (and one of the most notable deviations from previous tellings); Beverly (Jessica Chastain), a fashion designer who was physically and sexually abused by her father; Eddie (James Ransone), a risk assessor who suffers from hypochondria and had an overbearing mother; Ben (Jay Ryan), a wealthy architect who used to be obese; Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the town librarian whose family suffered from drug abuse and still struggles with it himself; and Stanley (Andy Bean), who was frightened and weak as a child and is much the same as an adult. Not surprisingly, a movie that has to juggle so many plot threads at once  and that's not including the violent bully Henry (Teach Grant), who went to prison after murdering his father in the first movie  will wind up shortchanging a few of them. The big twist about Richie feels underdeveloped, which is a shame given Hader's strong dramatic performance, and the movie's attempts to tie into larger social issues comes across as forced, if well-intentioned. Likewise the movie's attempt to elevate a crucial choice made by Stanley early in the story into something more noble falls flat. In both King's 1986 novel and the 1990 television film, that aspect of Stanley's character felt like a lazy anti-Semitic stereotype. Here it's more respectable, but only makes sense if Stanley knew things that, in plot terms, only another character could possibly have known. Advertisement: These aren't the only story glitches in"

Some will make you say ""wow"" for the sheer daring of their surrealism and the startlingly graphic nature of their execution. Others will make you say ""wow"" because they really do not work. Either way, director Andy Muschietti has absolutely gone for it with the sequel to his 2017 smash Stephen King adaptation, taking big swings and displaying both a muscularity and an elegance to his craft. And given that his film stretches nearly three hours, he gets more than ample opportunity to show off all those tools. ""It Chapter Two"" can be a sprawling, unwieldy messoverlong, overstuffed and full of frustrating detoursbut its casting is so spot-on, its actors have such great chemistry and its monster effects are so deliriously ghoulish that the film keeps you hooked. You won't check out entirely, but you will check your watch several times. In adapting the second part of King's nearly 1,200-page tome, returning writer Gary Dauberman is in a tricky spot: What to keep? What to cut? He does a bit of both while also incorporating moments from the first film as well as new scenes featuring the characters as kids to fill in some gaps. As in the original, ""It Chapter Two"" works best when the members of the self-proclaimed Losers Club are bouncing off each other, their banter infused with a sparkling mix of hormones, humor, insecurity and camaraderie. Unfortunately, Muschietti and Dauberman spend a lot of their time keeping their perfectly picked actors apart on individual adventures, which drags out the drama and slows down the momentum. Just as the ending of the first film foreshadowed, though, the kids who escaped the villainous grasp of the evil clown Pennywise during the summer of 1989 have found themselves back in Derry, Maineright on cue, 27 years later, to fight him again. They'd all gone their separate ways and carved out vastly different lives, and in introducing us to these characters as adults, Muschietti makes some gorgeous transitions that are smooth and inventive. But returning to their seemingly idyllic small town instantly revives their old rhythms and relationships. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa as an adult, Chosen Jacobs as a child) is the only one of the bunch who stayed in Derry; he's the self-styled historian and the one who makes the fateful phone calls to round up his old pals when Pennywise resurfaces. Bill (James McAvoy/Jaeden Martell) has gone on to become a novelist whose latest book is being adapted into a film, one of several meta bits scattered throughout. Beverly (Jessica Chastain/Sophia Lillis), who endured a controlling, abusive relationship with her father, is now in a controlling, abusive relationship with her husband. Richie (Bill Hader/Finn Wolfhard) is a hard-drinking, trash-talking stand-up comic who's as acerbic as ever. (Hader's performance is the highlight within this terrific ensemble as he shows off his perfect comic timing as well"

Adapting any Stephen King novel  or, for that matter, shorter material  is always a hit-or-miss gig, but It Chapter Two manages to pull out all the stops and in several areas actually tops the first film. No mean feat, that, as It was absolutely the creepshow that King fans have been slavering for for decades, chock-full of genuinely dream-snatching horror imagery bound together within a latticework of unrelenting dread and the everlasting kidhood bond of its young protagonists. And then there was Pennywise (played again here by Skarsgard), Barnum & Bailey's worst nightmare and then some. An apropos analogy: If It was The Evil Dead of soul-and-psyche-raping harlequin horror shows, then It Chapter Two is comparable to Raimi's Evil Dead 2 in terms of sheer lunatic inventiveness and stupefying scenes of hallucinatory, visceral viciousness. As one of the now grownup Losers Club puts it (in a droll homage to John Carpenter's The Thing), ""You gotta be fucking kidding me."" Set 27 years after the events of the first film, Chapter Two reunites (mostly) the no-longer-Losers Club characters as they make good on their childhood promise to return to the well and truly cursed Maine hamlet of Derry. With the lone exception of Mike Hanlon (Mustafa), who has stuck around as the town librarian for the intervening two-decades-plus in order to keep an eye out for the potential return of the soul-sucking, child-gnawing Bozo from beyond, the gang has scattered into their adult lives, their memories of that long-ago nightmare summer oddly forgotten. Smartass Richie (Hader) is now a stand-up comic, ""Stuttering"" Bill (McAvoy) has turned out to be a successful novelist, Bev (Chastain) is a Chicago fashion designer, the once-overweight Ben (Ryan) is now a buff architect, and asthmatic Eddie (Ransone) pilots a limo. Only Stanley (Bean) seems to still be haunted by the ghosts of Derry past. It's no spoiler to say that the Losers are quickly reunited in that strange little town, called from afar by Mike, who reminds them of the oath they took after vanquishing (heh, heh, hur) Pennywise back in 1989. Apart from that, I'll say little about Chapter Two's serpentine plotting, except to note that returning screenwriter Gary Dauberman (working without It co-scribes Cary Fukunaga and Chase Palmer this time out) infuses the proceedings with somewhat more adult terrors, as befits the storyline. That said, Chapter Two frequently switches timelines, revisiting the more youthful Losers Club in order to underscore or, occasionally, explicate the actions of their older and presumably  but not always  wiser selves. Incoming director of photography Checco Varese's eye makes for a notably different shade of ghastliness, too. Whereas It DP (and Park Chan-wook stalwart) Chung Chung-hoon kept the first film visually disconcerting and tonally queasy (appropriately so, given the kid's-eye view of the brutal goings-on), Varese goes for the gut punch, making Chapter Two a more sustained cavalcade of ghoulish grue.

What we live isn't so easily catalogued; it mutates, skitters, and fades in the face of the prevailing story we dictate about who we imagine ourselves to be. But what happens when memories long forgotten and inescapable come to the forefront? Who do we become then? It's this emotional bramble of yearning and personal storytelling that is the engine of director Andy Muschietti's It Chapter Two. The film's focus on memory sometimes works to its advantage, reminding us in plentiful flashbacks that what illuminated and elevated its predecessor was the tender, sparkling chemistry of its young cast. The film draws a distinct line from the hurts of the characters' younger selves to the wounds they carry as adults 27 years later when the film picks up. They drop their respective lives in order to return to Derry and finish the battle that they started long ago at the urging of a desperate Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of the Loser's Club to stay in their hometown, eventually becoming the town librarian who has given his life over to obsession. But each of them is bruised in their own fashion. Ben (Jay Ryan) has shed his weight and become a successful architect still haunted by the bullying of his past. (He carries around a yearbook page as if its signature is the only act of kindness he's ever received.) Eddie (James Ransone) is a terrifyingly high-strung adult. Bill (James McAvoy) has found success as a novelist but can't seem to pull off an ending  his introduction on a film set includes a Peter Bogdonavich cameo, of all things  and remains shadowed by the loss of his younger brother, Georgie. Richie (Bill Hader) is a standup comedian and barely functioning alcoholic. Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is in a brutally abusive marriage, revealed in an increasingly uncomfortable scene that is never properly addressed again. That's the thing: It Chapter Two moves with an almost too swift purpose, never feeling the weight of its nearly three-hour runtime; although it is long, the film feels frustratingly thin. Meanwhile, the film is aggressively sentimental, and moments of emotional catharsis or terror don't often hit the way they need to. When they do, it is because of the dedication of the acting. Most galling in It Chapter Two is its uneven application of horror. (All this despite an unfurling of horror references onscreen, including a sequence that takes a page from The Thing.) The various ghouls that besiege the grown-up Loser's Club, all visions of Pennywise, are silly, textureless creations. With them, suspense is in short supply. Their scares are more gross than chilling, leaving little impact once they're out of sight. Perhaps the greatest failure in this regard is how criminally it wastes Pennywise himself, although Bill Skarsgard's gusto is appreciated.

""It Chapter Two"" features the same group of talented young actors as the original 2017 film, and also adds older versions of these characters, who are in their 40s. Director Andy Muschietti attempts to honor everyone involved, including Stephen King, author of the 1986 novel ""It,"" so the movie is like a game of musical chairs that runs too long. And since Muschietti has few scare tactics at his disposal, the film loses its capacity to frighten. You will recall that ""It"" had the Losers Club defeat Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), a demonic spirit that can take many forms but prefers that of a demented clown. Twenty-seven years pass  this film is set in 2016  and only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) remembers what happened. Like a bad nightmare, the rest of them barely recall that period in their young lives. Now that Pennywise is on the prowl again, hunting children and other vulnerable people, Mike contacts the rest of the Losers and asks them to return to Derry, Maine. Only together can they defeat Pennywise once and for all. At first, Muschietti successfully taps into the novelty of older actors playing adult versions of child characters. James Ransone plays the older version of Eddie, the hypochondriac motormouth, and he finds heartbreaking notes of paralyzing fear. Bill Hader leaves a strong impression as Richie, the bespectacled comic relief whose need to tell jokes is almost a crutch. Mike asks the Losers to venture out alone, effectively reacquainting them with the events of that fateful summer and reliving past traumas. The Losers Club, now all grown up: (from left) Bill Hader as Richie, Jessica Chastain as Beverly, James McAvoy as Bill, James Ransone as Eddie, Isaiah Mustafa as Mike and Jay Ryan as Ben. (Brooke Palmer/Warner Bros. Pictures) Once the Losers separate in Derry, ""Chapter Two"" grinds to a halt. This sequence is essentially an opportunity for every actor, both young and old, to interact with some version of Pennywise. Once again Muschietti relies on jump scares and unsettling imagery, techniques that are, admittedly, effective. But after yet another Loser experiences an ultra-vivid hallucination, we get the point. At nearly three hours long, the need to resolve every subplot creates a gnawing sense of impatience. Screenwriter Gary Dauberman includes meta-jokes about how King never quite knows how to nail an ending, but that common criticism exists for a reason. Monsters and giant clowns are not the only thing that make the film disturbing. ""Chapter Two"" opens with a violent hate crime, and adult Beverly (Jessica Chastain) deals with brutal domestic abuse. Maybe these scenes are meant to show this is a more ""mature"" horror film, except Muschietti does not deal with their ramifications in a sensitive or dramatically consistent way. Real trauma is given the same consideration as a literal funhouse of horrors, which cheapens what the characters and audience are put through. The first ""It"" was such a commercial and critical"

Perfectly capturing the nostalgia of '80s movies but never forsaking fear or characterization, IT became a horror movie with immense replay value. It also raised the bar high for any subsequent installment that would focus on the second half of King's book wherein the children grew up into adulthood. Unfortunately IT: Chapter Two tries too hard to please everyone, burdened by the luminosity of its original child actors and desperate to recreate everything you loved in 2017 with everything that needs to be told now. Equal parts bloated and plodding, IT: Chapter Two ends up a disappointing misfire. Twenty-seven years after the first defeat of Pennywise the killer clown, the Losers Club must reunite to get rid of him once and for all. You wouldn't think a film with a premise that simple would command a near-three-hour Avengers-level runtime, and yet that's just the first of many miscues to be found in IT: Chapter Two. The first hour is predominately exposition, showing us what each of the Losers has been doing with themselves for 27 years. Former leader Bill (James McAvoy) is now a screenwriter with an inability to write a good ending, not unlike a particular bespectacled author whose last name rhymes with Cling. His wife is an actress...and that's all you need to know about that. Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is a wealthy wife to a man as physically abusive as her father was. Eddie (James Ransone) remains a hypochondriac married to a woman that I still can't tell whether she's the same actress who played his mother or not. Ritchie (Bill Hader) is a successful comedian. Ben (Jay Ryan) is an architect with a six-pack. And Stan (Andy Bean) just wants to do a puzzle and go to Argentina. These summations might sound simplistic and that's because they are. IT: Chapter Two should be about the adult Losers but the script (credited solely to Gary Dauberman) hopes to redo as much of what worked in the original as it can, and that means a lot of flashbacks. Nearly half the movie is told with flashbacks to a brief period from the first movie, wherein the Losers drifted apart during the summer before their final fight with Pennywise at the Neibolt house. Because the kids are now older they can't be brought back to reprise their roles so they all get a healthy dose of de-aging technology applied. The results are frightening, on par with Henry Cavill's mustache-free face. The gang has a waxy pallor with the uncanny valley prominent. Some performers, like Jack Dylan Grazier as young Eddie, seem to have their voice altered to sound like they did pre-puberty, giving him a voice mimicking a chipmunk. If this was just one or two"

The second half of Stephen King's horror bestseller about the terrifying clown (is there any other kind?) has now been adapted as a separate but frankly laborious film to follow the first one. That was the story of how a bunch of middle-school kids in a small American town in the 1980s banded together to defeat a homicidal harlequin of hell called Pennywise. His relationship to them made him an antichrist version of ET. Now, almost 30 years later, they are all grown up and must return to their home town to face the horrible Pennywise all over again  as adults. Screenwriter Guy Dauberman (who worked on The Conjuring franchise) adapts the second half of King's novel and the director once again is Andy Muschietti. There is some lively stuff here, including a few sensational cameos and interesting ideas about confronting one's personal demons, about homophobia, abuse and depression. It is also about the ubiquitous availability of the past in the digital age and the permanent reunion-stalkerthon of social media, and about the way guilt and shame are built into what we choose to remember and forget about our teenage years. But, like the first film, it becomes a virtual non-narrative anthology of standard jump-scares that could be reshuffled and shown in any order. The second time around, your tolerance for this is tested to destruction and beyond because, unlike the first movie, it is just so pointlessly long: approaching three hours, with our heroes finally beginning to assume a glassy-eyed solemnity like Hogwarts graduates or the Fellowship of the Ring. Muschietti is even hinting at a possible third chapter. The way they battle Pennywise as grownups is not much different from the way they did it as kids (although, arguably, these new confrontations are unlocking painful childhood memories) and Chapter Two seems to consist of an indefinite number of big, scary set pieces, featuring interchangeable snaggle-toothed creatures, or occasionally gigantic, fairground-sized monsters lurching grotesquely up out of nowhere. The scenes deliver reasonably efficient scares, but with the tension level repeatedly and disconcertingly reset afterwards to zero: the scenes don't develop or accumulate anything within a story arc and it feels as if the movie is jumping the shark and jumping back again, increasingly spending more and more time the wrong side of the shark and finally staying there. The situation is that Pennywise (played again by Bill Skarsgard) mysteriously returns to the little town of Derry, Maine, metaphysically reconfigured or reincarnated, perhaps, by an ugly display of homophobic abuse  an interesting acting cameo here for the Canadian director Xavier Dolan. Mike (played now by Isaiah Mustafa) is the only one of the gang to have stayed behind in Derry, and he gets in touch with everyone.

If ""not your mother's Mean Girls"" means it's a departure from the problematic jokes that were a hallmark of the noughties (and of Tina Fey, who wrote the original, the Broadway musical from which the new version is an adaptation of and this current iteration), then it certainly delivers on that promise for Gen Z. A quick, relatively spoiler-free rundown of some of the big changes: much of the cast are queer people of colour, including Damian (Jacquel Spivey) and Janis (Auli'i Cravalho), from whose perspective the story is told. Cady (Angourie Rice) has transferred from being homeschooled specifically in Kenya instead of the monolithic Africa (and Kevin G nicknames her ""Water Bird""  in the original it is ""Africa""), and the different social groups aren't categorised by race. Damian sings the I, Carly theme song in French instead of Christina Aguilera's Beautiful at the Christmas talent show. The ""obsessed lesbian"" rivalry between Janis and Regina (Renee Rapp) remains, though it is more fleshed out (perhaps owing to the bisexuality of the two actors who play them), with Janis being openly queer and Regina playing that up to appeal to the male gaze (when a game of spin the bottle in middle school requires that the two kiss, which leads to their falling out). The difference this time around is that Janis won't be shamed for her sexuality, and her trauma is that she lost her best friend, was bullied and kicked out of school. The humanisation afforded to its characters also extends to Regina. In the original, Regina was a fairly stock standard, one-dimensional villain, however well-played by the sorely underrated Rachel McAdams. The musical addition of Regina's songs, Someone Gets Hurt and World Burn, grant us insight into her motivations outside of having ""money and looks"". Someone Gets Hurt lets us see that her pride and her ""cold and forbidding"" persona are a ""performance/This is all self-defence,"" while World Burn reinforces her barriers after she is the one who gets hurt: ""This is what I get for helping... I wanna watch the world burn/And everyone get mean."" Some might say that the Mean Girls redux is ""too nice"", but if the bar is Y2K-era insults then the bar is very low indeed. There are none of the fat-shaming, homophobic or racist slurs, but Regina is still a terrifying bully, perhaps even more so than McAdams's version because Renee Rapp is legitimately scary. (Just ask Buddy the bus driver.) The Burn Book crucially still exists, and thankfully it remains in analogue (""from that week [the teachers] took away our phones"") instead of on social media or as a text chain. Some of the updated insults don't quite land though: ""fat virgin"" is now ""horny shrimp"" and ""fugly slut"" is now ""fugly cow"". As Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, author of the new book So Fetch:"

Not to pigeonhole Mean Girls as ""millennials only"" nostalgia, but the Tina Fey-penned comedy, based on Rosalind Wiseman's high school expose Queen Bees and Wannabes, was the teen movie of the 2000s, the one that has passed the zeitgeist test of time. It would be impossible to not compare the original and this 20-years-later remake, but even with the added bonus that this is an adaptation of the 2018 Broadway musical revamp, there's a hollow emptiness to this rendition that's thoroughly soul-sucking. It's as if by adapting the film, which was adapted from a book, into a musical and back into a movie, Fey was left utterly clueless as to why the movie she wrote two decades ago worked so well in the first place. The big arc is the same, pitching newcomer Cady Heron (Rice) and her social reject friends Damian (Spivey) and Janis (Cravalho) against Regina George (Rapp) and her Plastics. Yet to cut time to bring in musical numbers, microscenes that gave the film full-rounded characters or that mattered to the story are adjusted or scrapped. Instead, each character is given a song (or most characters are, because they removed stage Damian's tap-dance number), but not all of those songs feed into story or character development. Like Plastic Karen (Avantika), whose song ""Sexy"" is based around Amanda Seyfried's iconic delivery of, ""I'm a mouse, duh,"" a song that's no more than a party anthem to remind the viewer that it's Halloween. The Halloween party is a big turning point for Cady in the film, the one where she finally sees popular Plastic Regina for who she truly is; but instead of spending time with the two, developing Cady's relationship to Regina, Fey's script and Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr.'s direction opt for atmosphere over substance. By removing interactions between characters, the film is left with no soul. Plastics Gretchen (Wood) and Karen stay sidekicks, or hyenas, as Cady coolly calls them. They become defined by the jokes made to tear them down: Karen a ""dumb slut"" and Gretchen a superficial wannabe. This goes against the message of the original film, which is that women have more to them below the surface and if high school didn't pit us against each other, we would see that. Which leads to the movie's main problem: Regina George. Renee Rapp is an incredibly alluring, charismatic talent that feels crushed by Jayne and Perez Jr.'s dull direction. Oddly, for a movie that builds up to a simmering third-act battle between Cady and Regina, Regina's presence feels muted. The musical even cuts out their big blowout, the fight that leads to Regina getting hit by a bus, in service of a ""fuck you"" song from Janis (titled ""I'd Rather Be Me"") that puts the girls' ultimate showdown match in the background instead of the foreground. A fun song in theory, but it takes away from Cady's personal growth by omitting her big"

It is a legitimate question, but I certainly don't think of the original Mean Girls as a ""cult classic"". It was hugely popular (and well-reviewed) as soon as it was released. So much so that, every 3 October, a screenshot of Lindsay Lohan delivering the line ""on October 3rd, he asked me what day it was"" reliably fills my social media feed. Everyone recognises quotes such as ""stop trying to make fetch happen"" and ""on Wednesdays, we wear pink"". That's the amazing thing about it: dripping with writer Tina Fey's acerbic wit, Mean Girls achieved mainstream success. It still feels like a miracle to see such an entertaining film about teenagers refuse to be stupid or condescending. However popular Mean Girls is, though  or perhaps because it remains so popular  I was still bewildered to learn a musical remake was coming out. A sequel, Mean Girls 2, which no one seems to have watched, was released years ago, but a 2018 Broadway musical of the film has become extremely popular. Mean Girls (2024) is a strange beast: with a nearly identical screenplay written by Tina Fey (who also resumes her role as the high-school teacher Ms Norbury), it's brought down mainly by mediocre musical numbers. The film is provocatively marketed as ""Not your mother's Mean Girls"". (Though any teenage viewers from 2004 with teenagers now would have had to have had a kid, what, two years after leaving school?) That aside, this basically is the old Mean Girls, with a few interesting differences. The plot is the same: Cady (here played by Angourie Rice), an American home-schooled 16-year-old who has been living with her parents in Kenya, is a newcomer at North Shore High School, where she befriends outsiders Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey) before accidentally falling in with the ""Plastics"": the school queen bee Regina George (Renee Rapp) and her minions Karen (Avantika) and Gretchen (Bebe Wood). Janice and Damian persuade Cady to infiltrate the group as retaliation for Regina's past cruelty. A few of the jokes are toned down (the line ""I didn't leave the South Side for this!"" from Tim Meadows' school principal in the original becomes ""I didn't go to graduate school for this""), and others updated (sometimes successfully, as when the sex-ed teacher warning, ""If you have sex, you will get pregnant  and die"" becomes instead the promise of an upcoming lesson on choking). Surprisingly for a musical aimed at teens, a light satire of pop feminism and therapy-speak is sprinkled throughout, as when Gretchen Wieners says, ""Cady, if you don't dress slutty, it's slut-shaming us,"" or when Regina George, seducing Aaron at the Halloween party, says, ""I guess I have a lot of unresolved trauma about how everything ended with us."" Other changes are bewildering: why does Gretchen's line ""my father invented the"

This testament to bad taste is like Barbie, Gidget and Godzilla all rolled into one; it keeps coming back like a cinematic Covid, and you can't beat it to death with a stick. This version of the 2004 teenybopper movie and 2018 Broadway stage musical, both written by the usually clever Tina Fey, is also further proof that sometimes when you go to the cinema, even at today's inflated prices, you already know what you're going to see when you get there. I went to this mindless Mean Girls re-hash expecting vulgarity, eardrum-endangering screeching from an array of nerds and floozies in hideous purple, plum, puce and red pomegranate costumes, yelling boring pop-rock tunes about sex, angst, and teenagers behaving badly, amid an armory of smartphones, laptops, and brainless textingand that's exactly what I got. 2024 is very young, but in the months ahead, I seriously doubt things will get any worse than Mean Girls. A film born to fruition by the bewildering low-brow box-office success of Barbie (the ugly sets have what looks like all the leftover pink paint), directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez, Jr., it's a first feature that shows no need for a second. If you survived any of the previously microwaved incarnations, you already know the preposterous plot: a girl named Cady (Angourie Rice), home-schooled in Africa, is uprooted and moved from Kenya to a public school in the suburbs of Chicago, where she is introduced to the thrills of rapping, Starbucks, and cafeteria mac and cheese, and plunged into the hateful, back-stabbing rituals of an American high-school education like a kitten tossed into a tub of ice water. The school's popularity poll is topped by a trio of long-legged bimbos called The Plastics, who greet newcomer Cady with cruelty and rejection, so on her first nervous day at North Shore High, she is befriended by two school outcastsa chubby, flamboyantly gay comic relief named Damian (Jaquel Spivey) and a Goth named Janis played by Auli'i Cravalho, who sings like a sledgehammer. In the 2018 musical version on Broadway, Damian wore nothing but pink, carried a photo of George Michael next to his heart, and stopped the show with a hilarious tap dance number called ""Stop!"" Fearing laughs that might be taken the wrong way, the Damian character in this version has been cast to avoid caricature, the ""Stop!"" number is gone, and so is the humor. The new Damian lacks the comic timing necessary to make his character tolerable, and his incessant limp-wristed cliches grow wearisome fast. The best production number used to be the one that gave the cast a chance to jump, leap, and slide around the stage on cafeteria serving trays. It landed on the cutting-room floor, too.

Although part of the key demographic for the filmI was a senior in high school when it was releasedI have never been a big fan. The original film coasts on zingy one-liners and the star power of its castLindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried are fantastic as the core fourbut the film is dragged down by humor rooted in racist stereotypes and other problematic elements best left in the mid-2000s. Thankfully, this latest version from directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. and based on the 2018 Broadway musical adaptation of the 2004 film, brings a refreshing Zoomer spin to the material. Previously homeschooled by her research scientist mother (Jenna Fischer) while the two lived in Kenya, naive Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is a junior learning to navigate public high school's various cliques for the first time. This iteration already begins on a less creaky start by specifying Kenya as the place of Ms. Heron's research, rather than the vague ""Africa"" of the previous film. It also eschews the many, many offensive and feeble attempts at mining the place of Cady's upbringing for humor. Cady finds her first day of school to be harder than she imagined until she's befriended by art freaks Janis 'Imi'ike (a marvelous Aulii Cravalho) and Damian Hubbard (a hilarious Jaquel Spivey) who show her the ropes. The duo narrate, often breaking the fourth wall to directly address the audience through song. Here again the various cliques are described in terms that are specific (horny band geeks, burnouts etc.) without relying on the racial stereotypes found in the earlier film. Time seems to stop completely when the queen bee herself, Regina George (a star-making Renee Rapp), head of the a popular girl clique known as the Plastics, enters the lunchroom, cheese fries in hand. Like everyone, from the word go, Cady is intoxicated by Regina's powerful presence. Rapp dominates the screen with her towering frame. The directors capture her commanding presence through a mixture of wide shots that show the waves she leaves behind as she moves through the student body, but also through close-ups as Rapp's expressive face exudes nothing but pure allure. The Plastics are rounded out by an affecting Bebe Wood, who brings the same fragile strength to Gretchen Wieners, Regina's much put-upon best friend, as she brought to her role in ""Love, Victor."" Here, Gretchen is given one of the film's most emotionally resonant songs about body image and self-esteem. Anyone who's ever had a toxic best friend will relate. Then there's Avantika as Karen, aka ""the dumbest girl you'll ever meet."" This is a hard role to play and hard shoes to fill, as Seyfried (in her film debut) so expertly calibrated Karen's dimness with an effortless breeze a la Marilyn Monroe. Avantika often"

Penned by the comedic genius Tina Fey (Saturday Night Live) and featuring the talents of a youthful Lindsay Lohan (The Parent Trap), the film artfully depicted high school as a tumultuous battleground defined by archetypal cliques. Fast forward to 2018, and Tina Fey's original screenplay underwent a theatrical transformation, landing on Broadway as the dazzling Mean Girls: The Musical. However, this triumphant debut was abruptly halted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, bringing the curtains down on its promising run. Now, the narrative takes an intriguing turn with the latest iteration of Fey's beloved tale. This fresh adaptation not only draws inspiration from the original screenplay but also enlists several stars from the acclaimed musical to breathe new life into the iconic characters. Directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. in their feature directorial debuts, the film is set set against the backdrop of North Shore High School. It follows the journey of home-schooled Cady Heron (Angourie Rice, impressive) as she makes the transition from the African jungle where she was brought up by her scientist mother, to a modern American High School where status is everything. First befriended by Damien (Jaquel Spivey) and Janice (Auli'i Cravalho), a dynamic queer duo who offer to guide her through her through her new surroundings, Cady is later seduced by the ""plastics"" , a trio of shallow mean girls headed by the beautiful, but deeply cruel Regina George (Renee Rapp, magnificent). As she sinks deeper into her new persona and status, Cady is soon forced to face her own prejudices when her new friendships threaten to derail her studies and standing with her friends. Mean Girls 2024 effectively blends the charm of a beloved teen comedy with the dynamic energy of a musical, providing an entertaining experience that caters to fans of the original film and the Broadway adaptation. While nowhere near as fresh or as authentic as the much loved 2004 original, the film skilfully incorporates themes from Rosalind Wiseman's ""Queen Bees and Wannabes,"" presenting a contemporary exploration of the challenges confronting today's youth. While the film does offer its fair share of humor and entertainment, it's somewhat disconcerting to see the production occasionally relying on cheap TikTok trends and influencer cameos that feel both cringe-inducing and wholly unnecessary. While the musical numbers fail to leave a lasting impression, this latest interpretation of the cherished story still stands out as a highly entertaining experience. It is regrettable, however, that the production did not make more concerted efforts in incorporating Lindsay Lohan into the fabric of the narrative  Lohan's presence is limited to a somewhat awkward and belated cameo toward the end of the film."

Twenty years ago, the original Mean Girls pinned down a new millennial strain of adolescent narcissism and pettiness, and because of that  as well as the fact it was very funny  it soon became one of the definitive high-school comedies of the age. Guess what? Its story of vying classroom cliques translates perfectly to the Gen-Z era, with only the gentlest of updates. Now rumours don't just circulate but go viral on TikTok, identity isn't just a social consideration but an existential one, while victimhood confers its own kind of weird moral status. In the 2004 version, Lindsay Lohan's international transfer student Cady Heron wryly informs us that Halloween is ""the one night of the year when girls can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it."" But in 2024, before Angourie Rice's version of the character can get so much as a word in, Avantika Vandanapu's Karen Shetty, one of the fearsome alpha girls known as the Plastics, quickly scolds: ""Cady, if you don't dress slutty, that's slut-shaming us."" In other words, even when it comes to basic wisdom about appropriate clothing, nobody has learned anything. Or if they did, they also quickly worked out how to get around it. In which case, why remake Mean Girls at all? Because, as its entire publicity campaign has strenuously tried to conceal, this new version is actually a musical. A stage adaptation  written, like the original, by Tina Fey  opened on Broadway in 2017, and this is a screen version of that production, shot for the most part like a conventional high-school movie but with regular extra-widescreen detours into pop-video make-believe. While you don't have to be doused in Mean Girls lore to enjoy it, it carries itself like a sing-a-long tribute, with every classic gag delivered like an applause line and every key scene overplayed with lip-smacking relish. When the queen bee Regina George (Renee Rapp) is first introduced, the world doesn't simply go into flattering slow motion: the canteen lights snap off and she struts in, Christina Aguilera style, purring ""My name is Regina George, and I am a massive deal"" in a contralto that could start forest fires.

For millennials, it's basically an invitation to fight. But, sadly, a snappy comeback is a little too easy. Not your mother's Mean Girls? This is exactly your mother's Mean Girls  just repackaged with a bunch of TikTok cameos and some of Fey's B-tier jokes. Hell, Ariana Grande managed to do more with the material when she spoofed the original film for her video to ""Thank U, Next"". This Mean Girls is, practically scene by scene, the same story as the OG: homeschooled, socially naive Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) moves back to the United States from somewhere in rural Africa only to discover that the kids of the school cafeteria are no different to the creatures of the savanna. She teams up with the art freaks, Janice (Aulii Cravalho) and Damien (Jaquel Spivey), in order to take down queen bee Regina George (Renee Rapp) and her ""plastics"", minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika), in order to clear the way and win the heart of Regina's ex, Aaron (Christopher Briney). As the film insists, enough time has passed for Mean Girls to turn into Mean Mothers. But girlhood politics have hardly stayed the same, and, while Fey has obviously snipped the original film's more distasteful jokes, her script's still firmly entrenched in the feminist dilemmas of the early 2000s. Can women be overtly sexual and still wield economic power, one of the film's songs asks, to no one in particular. And, while Cady still attempts to ruin Regina's street cred by tricking her into gaining weight, the film awkwardly dances around the genuine fat shaming the set piece involves. Today's teen girls, of course, are still plagued by the same body image issues as their generational predecessors and face the same cruelty from their peers, but there's a whole new language of ""clean eating"" and ""pick-me girls"" at play, too  and it's complex and distinct enough for young audiences to rightfully deserve their own Mean Girls. But this isn't it. Instead, the same punchlines are recycled (""almost too gay to function"", ""stop trying to make fetch happen"", ""you go, Glen Coco!""), with added product placement for Elf cosmetics and a new ring light for Regina's ""cool mom"" (Busy Philipps). Directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr do their best to add some visual ingenuity with what seems like a tight budget (the film was originally intended to debut directly onto the Paramount+ streaming platform), letting their camera twist and flip down the same hallway of lockers, transformed at one point into the rainbow fantasy of Taylor Swift's ""You Need to Calm Down"" video. But key songs from the stage musical, and fragments of key songs, have been pointlessly cut. And the cast, for the most part, buckle under the expectation of replicating the steel-cut comedic timing of,"
279,WJC_Doc9_Mean_Girls,WJC_Doc9_Mean_Girls,WJC,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"The musical version of ""Mean Girls"" has been adapted for the big screen and it's not just ""fetch,"" to use the teen comedy's ""cool"" synonym that's still trying to happen. It also feels surprisingly fresh, no mean feat for a property that is now 20 years old. It's even longer than that if you include Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 parental advice bestseller, ""Queen Bees and Wannabes,"" which inspired Tina Fey's original screenplay and the more recent Tony-nominated Broadway song-and-dance extravaganza. This newish take on the classic high-school-as-jungle satire makes the trek from film to stage and back to film again without forsaking comic snideness or draining an ounce of hormonal energy. It's ""Mean Girls"" for the TikTok generation, cleverly incorporating social media into its swirl of teen obsessions and anxieties. Much credit goes to the exuberance of the mostly young and new cast members, most of whom have the pipes to handle and even exceed the workmanlike stage tunes composed by Jeff Richmond and written by Nell Benjamin. First among equals is pop singer Renee Rapp as Regina George, the leather-clad ""apex predator"" of North Shore High School. Popular but feared, Regina treats all of her fellow students with disdain, especially the (un)lucky few who are part of the Plastics, the girl gang she leads. Rich girl Regina is nasty even when trying to be nice, as when she offers someone a ride in her convertible: ""Get in, loser, we're going shopping."" Rapp made her name playing Regina on Broadway, and her familiarity and confidence with the role are abundantly in evidence. It seems like heresy to say it, but I prefer Rapp to Rachel McAdams' original Regina in the 2004 version of ""Mean Girls."" Slightly less impactful, but still appealing, is Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, the new girl at North Shore High. The role was originally played by Lindsay Lohan, a more forceful actor than Rice. Cady recently returned to America from Kenya, where she was raised by her zoologist mom (there's no dad in this version). Cady regards people with the same combination of innocence and caution as she did wild animals on the African savannah. She's not yet savvy enough, though, to recognize the traps that Regina has prepared for her, first for amusement and later for revenge. The latter happens after Cady unknowingly falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend, Aaron (Christopher Briney), for whom she trills the song ""Stupid With Love."" Enter the defiantly weird Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and engagingly gay Damian (Jaquel Spivey), school outsiders who befriend Cady and try to convince her not be fooled by Regina and her obedient fellow Plastics, Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika), even if they do initially approve of Cady joining the gang so as to spy on them. A likeable duo, Janis and Damian frame the bare-bones plot of ""Mean Girls,"" replacing Lohan's voice-over narration of the first film. They break the fourth wall with their opening song, ""A Cautionary Tale,"" bringing to mind the Common Man character in"

Not only was the film a financial success, it treated teens like adults while being wickedly funny and smart. Since that time, the world of teen filmdom has changed extensively and in the grand tradition of the snake eating its own tail Hollywood has gone back to ""Mean Girls"" to tell the same story, again, albeit in a slightly different way. Paramount's new take on ""Mean Girls"" is a hybrid mash-up of both the original film and elements from the 2017 Broadway musical. (Though you wouldn't know that as the trailers for this new iteration haven't played up the musical component.) The game has changed though the players are the same, with the story still involving white African transplant Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) moving to an American high school and coming under the sway of the Plastics, teen royalty led by the villainous but fabulous Regina George (Renee Rapp). Initially planned as a Paramount+ release, the biggest problem ""Mean Girls"" 2024 has is its uncertainty with regards to its audiences. It clearly wants to cater to fans of the Broadway show and Gen Zers who love Renee Rapp, but also wants the millennial fanbase that still quotes the original film. But the script, which Fey returned to write, is so lean as to have no story at all. Despite being 15 minutes longer than the original, there's no fat to be found nor is there any real meat. In the time it takes Cady to sing one song we've already learned about her life in Africa, met her perpetually dizzy mother (a wasted Jenna Fischer), and dropped her into North Shore High. All that in the time it takes to watch a Tiktok video. And that sparsity of exposition extends to Cady meeting friends Janis and Damien (Auli'i Cravalho and Jaquel Spivey, respectively), who emphasize their deep friendship with Cady in spite of having one scene of genuine interaction. Even the meanness of the Plastics comes down to one sequence where Rapp growls  yes, growls  at another girl sitting with the boyfriend of fellow Plastic, Gretchen Weiners (Bebe Wood). Elements like the original film's narration gave audiences a glimpse into the character's headspace where here it's just baldly presented with no context. Most importantly, the original film told audiences how teen girls were acting and thinking in a post-9/11 landscape where three-way calling attacks allowed them to spy and talk trash without getting their hands dirty. Here, Fey tells us nothing about how teen girlhood has changed with the rise of social media, and while we know what Tiktok and Instagram have done for girls' self-esteem, the movie almost feels afraid to say anything too negative.

The movie's tagline, your mind is the scene of the crime, is so much more than a reference to what happens in the film. Sure the plot involves a group of dream-invading thieves, but in the process of telling that story, something much bigger happens inside your own head. It's as if writer/director Chris Nolan has invaded your brain as well. As he attempts to unlock the secrets of the human psyche, his movie implants its own ideas in your subconscious. You'll walk out of Inception questioning your own reality. It's a feeling I haven't had since the first time I saw The Matrix, only, Inception pulls it off without fetish leather and kung fu. Inception spends almost all of its running time risking collapse as the plot becomes more and more complicated. It never holds back. It dares to challenge its characters and its audience. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb as a desperate man teetering on the edge. We learn he has the technology to invade people's dreams and he uses it to get inside their head and steal secrets. Where this technology came from or exactly how it works is never discussed, it's accepted by everyone as a matter of course. Is Inception set in a near future? An alternate universe? We don't know it's just one of the many layers hidden inside Nolan's film left for you to either unravel or accept as the rules of this world. And as Cobb's story unfolds, it's riddled with more unexplained complexity. We learn that he's unable to return to America to see his kids, but don't know why. Are we even sure his kids exist? Is Cobb mad? At some point you'll have to decide, but Inception won't give you all the answers. Inception captures the inner workings of dreams in a way no other movie has before: Realistically. How do you know when you're dreaming? You don't, at least not until you wake up. The world of Nolan's dreams is almost real and you'll have to look closely around the edges for discontinuity, for the little places where things don't quite fit together. It's all there in the way the movie's filmed and as Hans Zimmer's brilliant, throbbing score swells around you in the theater and Nolan's carefully chosen images shine out from the screen you may even find yourself wondering not if you're watching a dream, but if you're actually in one. As the dreams go deeper the complexity of what's happening skews dangerously close to becoming overwhelming and there are a million moments in the film when it could have and maybe it all should have collapsed under its own weight, buried beneath Nolan's psychological hubris. At times understanding it is almost like trying to hold four or five different movies in your head all at once. Yet it never collapses. Inception runs along a razor's edge, layering worlds on top of each other"

If you're like my friends, you've seen the heavily-hyped imagery from the previews and commercials of a folding Paris skyline, an exploding cafe, gravity-defying hallway falls, and crumbling beachfront skyscrapers, all accompanied by a booming musical score and ominous narration by its star Leonardo DiCaprio. People constantly ask me ""Don, what the hell is that movie about?"" I can tell you right now, those images are just a taste of many like it, and that's only the start of the genius of Inception. It is, without a doubt, a challenging maze of dreams within dreams. Contrary to M. Night Shyamalan movies, or even the TV show Lost (which I love for the mental workout) that implausibly twist with very little explanation afterwords and cause their audience to feel baffled and turned off, Inception delivers twists that fit the evolving context of the story it's creating and commandingly wins your attention enough to not turn you off. While it may not seem like it, trust me, there is a point and a light at the end of the tunnel to this maze. Inception is essentially two things at its core. It's a ""one last job"" story for a thief and a dramatic story of regret and forgiveness of a father and husband, both of which are set in a modern science fiction setting that echoes shades of Minority Report with a dash ofThe Matrix. The thief is Dom Cobb, compellingly played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who wants nothing more than to be reunited with his two kids back home in the U.S., but his illegal activity has made him a wanted man. He also carries a deep and complicated regret with his wife Mal (luminous Public Enemies French actress and Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard) as to why he can't be there. Here's where you're going to start to need the salt grains. It's going to sound crazy and preposterous, but I promise it's easier to watch and enjoy than explain in words. Dreams are what is being stolen, but not in a Freddy Krueger way. Cobb is an ""extractor,"" a man who specializes in entering a person's subconscious by sharing in their dreams to steal that person's secrets for profit and corporate espionage. Imagine being able to steal the idea to invent the iPod before Steve Jobs was able to do it himself. You can't call it patent stealing or copyright violation because it doesn't exist yet. That's what Cobb does and he operates where our dreams occur, where we don't remember how they start, and when we don't know they're not real until we wake up. He does so by getting close to the subject, sedating the target, and plugging them into a mysterious briefcase. The case injects compounds that enable a shared dream experience for all of those plugged it. Cobb works with"

I've always believed that you cannot sum up the plot of a great film in a single sentence. It's proven true once again. I'd need reams of A4 paper before even attempting to dissect this storyline. It's a stunning achievement - one that has been ten years in the making for writer-director Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Dark Knight). So how do I describe the story? I need to give you all something. Essentially this film is about dreams. What if we lived in a world where we had the power to share dreams? What if we took this a step further and people were able to manipulate you in these dreams? I know we've seen films about this subject before (Strange Days springs to mind) but it's Nolan's vision which makes this so impressive. To use his own words, Nolan ""wanted to create a film that would allow the audience to experience the limitless realities that only in dreams can we realize."" The key word there is ""limitless"". It has given Nolan full reign to create some amazingly artistic sequences. There's a fight scene involving Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a hotel hallway which left me shaking my head with disbelief. There are many players in this intricate tale but the central character is Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), a master in dream extraction. He is paid to infiltrate people's minds and coerce them into revealing their deepest secrets. This is an incredibly powerful ability but as you can imagine, it's also highly illegal. Wanted by the authorities in America, Cobb was forced to flee the country and leave his young children behind. All he wants is to find a way to clear his name and return home. A wealthy businessman (Watanabe) is about to provide Cobb with that opportunity. If he can pull off one final job, he will use his connections and allow Cobb safe passage back into the United States. Their target is Robert Fischer (Murphy), the heir to a billion dollar energy business. This is a very different assignment though. Cobb will not be stealing memories. He will be implanting them. With the help of his team, he will be taking on this extremely risky process known simply as ""inception"". Legendary film critic Roger Ebert aptly described Inception as ""a movie immune to spoilers: if you knew how it ended, that would tell you nothing unless you knew how it got there."" I must say though that the film does end on a perfect note. Like everything that precedes it, it's designed to leave you thinking and to leave you talking. I just love movies like this. I can picture the wry smile on Christopher Nolan's face when he finally finished his first draft. He must have known this was something special. There's not a lot of background to the story (such as how the dream extraction technology evolved) and some viewers may be critical of this fact."

This gets a big laugh in a sublime brain-twister of a movie that plays out so intricately on so many levels simultaneously that a bathroom break comes at your own peril. Text for a few seconds and you may miss a key development. Leonardo DiCaprio leads a team of high-tech corporate saboteurs who descend deep into a target's dreams  with quite a few detours, some of them roadblocks set up by DiCaprio's late wife (Marion Cotillard). In a season of brain-dead spinoffs, ""Inception"" stands out as a singularly cerebral exception and will generously reward your 148 minutes of undivided attention. I strongly suspect a second visit will pay off even more. Not weighed down by the comic-book mythology of the two ""Batman"" movies and given a reported $150-million budget for his original concept, writer-director Nolan is free to let his imagination soar on an epic scale. Abetted by a world-class team of collaborators, he's crafted an instant sci-fi classic that surpasses its most obvious recent influences, ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix."" Unlike 99 percent of movies, the less you know about ""Inception"" going in, the better. So I'd advise you to stop reading now and head for the theater. OK, so you want more? DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, an expert at entering victims' dreams and extracting industrial secrets. He cannot return to the United States for reasons that are initially unclear, but prove to be emotionally resonant. He's approached by a wealthy businessman (Ken Watanabe) who wants Dom to reverse his usual procedure and instead implant an idea in a mark. Dom is to enter the dreams of the heir to an empire (Cillian Murphy) and convince him to dismantle it to the businessman's benefit. With a return to the US and a reunion with his two children dangled as the payoff, Dom assembles a dream team. There's his longtime organizer (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); an architect (Ellen Page) who constructs dazzling dream worlds; a ""forger"" (Tom Hardy) who can impersonate anyone at will; and a pharmacist (Dileep Rao) who enables very deep sleep. It isn't just as simple as putting the victim to sleep for 10 hours. The team and their client not only enter his dreams, but they enter dreams within his dreams and dreams within those dreams  so those 10 hours can translate into 10 years on the lowest level. Only the architect knows that Dom's late-wife-from-hell is lurking on all of those levels, and maybe even one below that, to mess with Dom's mind. The idea of entering dreams to manipulate someone isn't new  ""Dreamscape"" did that back in 1984  but Nolan raises the stakes with brilliantly deployed effects (Gordon-Levitt walking on ceilings is just one ""wow"" moment) and a fast-moving, globe-spanning story.

285,WKF_Doc5_Inception,WKF_Doc5_Inception,WKF,Action,Positive,Inception,"SPOILERS This film follows Cobb, a man who is payed to infiltrate peoples' subconscious through their dreams and extract information. He is hired by a man however to do the opposite, the impossible. To infiltrate a tycoon's subconscious and plant an idea instead of take one - known as inception. This movie shattered my comprehension and mind a million times over, and the more I try and work it out, the crazier it gets. How on earth does Chris Nolans brain work? How to you conceive this script from nothing? A story so intricate, intellectual, complex and layered that simply watching it is mind-bending, let alone writing it. The thought of sitting down and working through the labyrinth-like story and characters is incredible daunting. Every single facet of this film can be taken down a seemingly endless rabbit hole. Ive said this before, but now, truly, I can say: I have never seen anything like this. Nolan has pushed the boundaries of storytelling and how it doesn't necessarily have to be transparent for an audience to grasp onto it. There is a plethora of things I couldn't comprehend while watching - but it honestly never took away from the film in general. It was never too convoluted that I became overwhelmed and uninterested. Was I completely mind-broken, scratching my head the entire time, yes. But I still was able to focus on the plot point at hand and be insanely immersed. It struck an incredible balance of being complex, but still allowing the viewer to be immersed in the moment and not in thought. You don't have to understand the science and logic of it to have the watch of your life - vaguely understanding the labyrinth of layers and depth is kind of what makes it incredible. I can understand the scope and scale of what Nolan is doing, but I'm not going to sit down and map it all out. What a premise for a film, and what a delivery. Amid the spiderweb of subconscious and dreams within dreams, there is a character I grabbed onto and empathized with. Cobb is a broken widower, and it was fantastic learning about his trauma and wife piece by piece. We're guessing throughout at the entire picture of his past, but it is slowly, sometimes painfully unveiled to us with brilliant pacing. I was right there in those moments with Cobb as he opens up to Ariadne, or confronts his wife in the void. And the end, oh my god the end. He finally confronts his wife and the guilt he bears, giving us, the viewer, the final pieces of their story puzzle - catharsis man, catharsis. An incredible character and a heartbreaking story with high stakes attached, threatening to derail their mission. I really like what Cobbs story and the movie as a whole says in terms of our subconscious and trauma. Cobb suppressed his emotions and guilt for so long they threatened to consume him. Any mission he went"
286,WKF_Doc6_Inception,WKF_Doc6_Inception,WKF,Action,Negative,Inception,"It is with a heavy heart that I have to report that Christopher Nolan's latest exhibits one of the great schisms between grand intentions and inept executions to be seen at the movies in recent years. Only someone who never saw (or appreciated) Dark City would be able to call it visionary (or Paprika, or Heat, or Blade Runner, or 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Solaris [either one], or, uhm, The Matrix... should I go on?), as Nolan's long-gestating science fiction opus (he first conceived of it as a teenager) rarely rises above its own apparent reliance on these influences. Visually, they're the only thing that stands out from the film's enslavement to one of the more redundant and unmelodious scripts to ever grace a big budget film. In the year of The Social Network's dialectic melodies, Inception is even more blatantly like nails on chalkboard. By distilling the film to its key money shots, the preview was a rush. The movie entire is mostly a snooze. Nolan's core concept -- that a synthetic dreamland might give way to the raging subconscious of a tortured man -- is as conceptually appetizing as those similarly mind-fucky plots of the aforementioned films. It is tragic, then, that about 90%+ of Inception's running time feels like flight preparation; the stewardess, as she is, never shuts up. And here, she's every single one of the characters, a term I use loosely; mostly, they're ciphers for information, nothing more. Nolan's script seems scared shitless of letting the audience wonder about much of anything, less they get ""bored."" And so, it spends most of the time bending over backwards telling you things it might have far more creatively shown to you, or when it shows them to you, it usually tells you anyway, etc. The aforementioned Matrix might paint in similarly obvious strokes at times (""Trinity"" is a blatant metaphor, sure, but ""Mal"" should make cringe anyone who holds language sacred), but it's also beautifully stylized, consistently visually inventive, and presented as a great genre tease; it peels away the layers with titillating ease. In contrast, Inception talks at you ad nausea for nearly three hours, expects food market and architectural farts to blow your mind (the lame M.C. Escher shout-outs are the real kicker for me; one man's paradox is another's retarded staircase), and holds your hand as it walks with you through supposed dreamscapes (droll city skylines that are at best casually surreal; where's Lynch when you need him?). I can only speak for myself, but this is exactly the kind of movie where I'd rather be lost, at least for a bit. That would be interesting. The heist sequences, when they come, are something close to exciting, but that's mostly the attention-demanding score at work, and although a zero gravity Joseph Gordon-Levitt kicking ass is surely a beautiful thing, the overwhelmingly realistic presentation of the dreamland would seem to counter the reason for taking us into the dreamland in the first place (I'll"
287,WKF_Doc7_Inception,WKF_Doc7_Inception,WKF,Action,Negative,Inception,"I suppose how you feel about Inception depends on whether you compare it to Nolan's Batman movies, which I have not seen, or his brilliant breakout film, Memento, which I have seen more than once. Perhaps both of these comparisons are misguided and Inception should be evaluated in the company of other big budget, head-trippy futuristic fare, with or without sci-fi trappings; Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, Total Recall, Brazil, and no doubt lots of other stuff I've never seen. Be this as it may, I am inclined to compare Inception to Memento because the former so plainly presents itself as a thinking man's action thriller, with a complex psychological premise we are expected to find as engaging as the one around which Nolan constructed Memento. It would be easy merely to dismiss Inception's failure on this score as being the result of it saddling its complex psychological premise with way too much action thriller baggage. Clearly, the intense drama achieved by the low-budget, street life, daylight Noir of Memento is not even approximated by the capital-intensive, fantasy land, CGI overload of Inception. But the real problem with Inception has to do with its complex psychological premise in the first place. In the first place, it's truly not complex at all. Set aside all the mumbo-jumbo tech talk about how there are concentric rings of the unconscious that can be induced, invaded and controlled by others from without. What remains is the most banal, coffee-table Freudian stuff. So much smoke and mirrors about how to manipulate the inner workings of the mind through the power of suggestion, only to trot out and ride the tried and true hobbyhorse of a father figure fixation. Jesus, why not simply put the billionaire victim in intensive (and expensive) psychotherapy, let him take forever to get over daddy, and take over his inherited company while he's preoccupied on the couch. In the second place, the psychological premise is way too complex. On this score, the demands of the action thriller really are at fault. In order to establish the changing situations that facilitate the variety of thrilling action, the Byzantine architecture of the head-trippy plot takes on ever more inconsistent proportions that must be justified by ad hoc explanations in the dialogue. The constitutional articles of the psychological premise are continually undergoing congressional amendment. Just when being murdered in a dream is the mechanism for waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different mechanism is introduced. Just when there is definitely a mechanism of some sort - any sort - to ensure waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different and deeper ring of the unconscious is introduced, from which it may be impossible escape. The tolerance of the audience is over-taxed. And in the opinion of this taxpayer, the whole conceptual government deserves to be voted out of office. The incessant explanation of the psychological architecture saddles the action just as much"
288,WKF_Doc8_Inception,WKF_Doc8_Inception,WKF,Action,Negative,Inception,"At the movies, incomprehensible gibberish has become a way of life, but it usually takes time before it's clear that a movie really stinks. Inception, Christopher Nolan's latest assault on rational coherence, wastes no time. It cuts straight to the chase that leads to the junkpile without passing go, although before it drags its sorry butt to a merciful finale, you'll be desperately in need of a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color, shading and shadows, and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea, reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who haven't got a clue about plot, character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento, the perilously inert Insomnia, the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige, the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical, maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolan's scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception, and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. It's difficult to believe he didn't also write, direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche, New York. But as usual, like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman, Mr. Nolan's reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players, none of whom have an inkling of what they're doing or what this movie is about in the first place, and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who remains one of the screen's most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese's dopey insane-asylum bomb, one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo, not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed. I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible. Let's see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave, I wanted to jump in, but the thrill didn't last. Cut to the battered face of Leo, looking like a 14-year-old washed ashore facedown from a toy sailboat. He has come from another location conjured up in a dream, and is fond of muttering jabberwocky like ""I am the most skilled extractor of dreams."" In other words, he can close his eyes, enter somebody else's dreams with his pock-marked baby face and blow up China.

289,WKF_Doc9_Inception,WKF_Doc9_Inception,WKF,Action,Negative,Inception,"Writer/director Christopher Nolan is too obsessed with the mechanics of the gimmick and plot of Inception to make any intellectual leaps off the screen. Confined to the plot alone, the ideas of the movieabout dreams, perception of reality, the subconscious, etc.are sound in the way they help to implement the story. People talk a good deal in Nolan's world of and about ""shared dreaming,"" but most of the dialogue is establishing (then re-establishing, adding new twists, or changing) the rules of the game. And make no mistake about it: Inception is a game, through and through. Nolan has proven himself adept not only at creating mind games like this and carrying us through their elaborate narrative structures but also sewing at least one, guiding thematic core to them. This is what is missing in Inception. For all its talk of big ideas, none of them involve us in the movie apart from considering how they tie to and lead the cat's cradle of a plot. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) specialize in securing the subconscious thoughts of their clients, although they are also prone to stealing them, too. A Japanese businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) approaches them with an offer: Plant the idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), a rival's son, to break up his father's company, which would help encourage competition (mainly, that of Saito's business) in the field. Arthur argues it's impossible to place an idea in someone's head and then asks Saito not to think about elephants. Nolan has some chutzpah to show how simple this ""impossible"" task is in the real world and then spend the rest of the movie putting his character's consciousnesses in jeopardy to do the same thing in the most convoluted way imaginable. It's a simple dismissal that since the idea of elephants isn't actually Saito's own, it won't stick. The process of planting the thought in Fischer's brain is so complicated that the issue never arises again. Once Saito has planted the seed of the inciting incident in Cobb's and Arthur's noggins, the rest of the movie takes on the form of a heist. Cobb runs point. Arthur does research. Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student, designs the dream worlds the team will use to navigate through Fischer's subconscious. Eames (Tom Hardy) will impersonate key figures in Fischer's life within his dream to load the scenario in their favor. The characters are their types without any further elaboration (except that Arthur and Eames don't get along and Ariadne is curious about the whole process and her new boss), and they only exist to lay down the laws of sharing another person's dream and to go through the motions of the reverse heist. Only Cobb has a backstory, which involves the subconscious influence of his dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), who repeatedly interferes with his plans, and visions of his two children, whose faces he longs to see again. His history, which he maintains in"

But his new client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants the impossible: for Cobb not to steal an idea but to plant one in a business rival's head. Why is an ""inception"" more difficult than an extraction? ""The subject's mind always knows the genesis of an idea,"" explains one characterwhich strikes my unoriginal and highly suggestible mind as dead wrong. But that's the premise, anyway. Cobb accepts the job because he longs to see his two little kids in the U.S. and is forbidden to return on account of a Crime to Be Revealed Later; and Saito says that with one phone call he can make the legal problems go away. (He just can.) Then Saito says what in this kind of thriller are magic words: ""Assemble your team."" A team of colorful specialists! Cool! So it's, like, Mission: Impossible in the Dreamscape-Matrix! Cobb's point man is Arthur, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also evokes The Matrix: He looks like Keanu Reeves's runty little brother. Eames (Tom Hardy) is the ""forger,"" who can impersonate people in dreams without those dumb M:I rubber masks. The chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), will create the badass sedatives that will hold the fragile three-dream edifice together. The brilliant architecture student Ariadne (Ellen Page) has two functions: dreamworld designer and exposition magnet. She's a newbie, so Cobb has to explain to her how the science works. It takes a lot of explaining. Nolan, who wrote the script, thinks like a mechanical engineer, and even when you can't follow what's happening, you can admire in theory the multiple, synchronized narrative arcs and cute little rules for jumping around among different flights of consciousness. He has two fresh ideas. In a dream, you can fall asleep and have another dream, in which you can fall asleep and have another dreamexcept time works differently at different depths. A minute up top might be, say, ten minutes in the dream, an hour in the dream within a dream, and, below that, years. Although the different levels look the same (too bad), the gimmick allows Nolan to have three clocks ticking down instead of one, and the editor, Lee Smith, has cut among them in ways so ostentatious that he's all but sewn up this year's editing Oscar. The other neat touch is the Freudian monster femme who keeps popping up: Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who emerges from his own unconscious (even in other people's dreams) to sabotage his schemes. Cotillard is clock-stoppingly gorgeous and has a great first scene. She surveys the debris raining down with glittering eyes, laughing in delight. But after that, the tone of her appearances is funereal. Mal is the key to the mysterious tragedy that eats away at Cobb. Up top, in the waking world, Ariadne worries to Arthur:"

All have their own dark secrets and hidden pasts. The survivors soon discover an abandoned geologic research station nearby. All of the scientists are gone, and we quickly find out why. Bizarre, bat-like nocturnal creatures live under the ground in the dark. They seem to be very hungry, and the scientists were their last meal. These creatures are like a mix of a bat, panther, hammerhead shark, and Alien. There are also smaller, faster flying versions. The survivors realize they must stick together if they want to make it off the planet, but most are selfish. The group's motto becomes: ""Let's stick together, because when the monsters come I only have to run faster than you!"" They must transport some power cells to a spacecraft in order to escape. But a rare eclipse of the three suns causes complete darkness. The creatures come out in full force and the race to survive begins. Only light keeps them at bay, but how long will it last? This is the best science fiction film of the new millennium! Well, technically the millennium starts in 2001, but still. Truthfully, I enjoyed this film. I wanted a good popcorn flick with cool effects and a lot of action, and that's what I got. The plot isn't deep, but it's effective for what it tries to be. The cast was well chosen. Vin Diesel was excellent as Riddicktough, mean, and definitely not a good guy, yet still likeable. He played the role very well, and I'd love to see him in more action movies. The rest of the cast also did a good job. The special effects weren't groundbreaking but were good. The ship crash was exciting, and a scene with the creatures flying during the eclipse was visually stunning. Colored filters gave the planet an alien look. I didn't like that effect at first, but it eventually worked. I liked the clever shots when Riddick stalks the othersdefinitely one of the funnier parts. Though it borrows from Aliens, the movie gave me what I always hoped an Aliens sequel might be. I enjoyed it a lot. There were flaws. The shaky cam and random slow-motion shots were distracting. The story ended in a rather anti-climactic way, and the religious subplot felt unresolved. Still, despite some flaws, Pitch Black delivered a thrilling sci-fi experience."

I'm not going to try to convince you that this tale of a group of space-crash survivors facing unknown danger on a mysterious planet is a greatly original work. Although it's the splashiest cutting-edge effects picture since ""The Matrix,"" it lacks that work's epic, synthetic sweep. But if your taste runs to that flavor of eye candy, ""Pitch Black"" will rock you. It's a tightly constructed genre picture, combining the best paranoid thrills of the ""Alien"" series with the setting of ""Mad Max"" and the anti-Utopian future of ""Blade Runner."" This is apparently Vin Diesel's big week. In this film, playing Riddick, a sinister, laconic convict with hidden depth, he looks like the first new action star of the 2000s. Meanwhile, in the next chamber of the multiplex, you can see him as a youthful stock-trading shark in the ensemble drama ""Boiler Room."" (Previously, Diesel had a small role in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and was the voice of ""The Iron Giant."") Riddick is a muscular badass, a multiple murderer who apparently shaves his head with axle grease. ""Human blood has a coppery taste,"" he tells Johns (Cole Hauser), the bounty hunter entrusted with taking Riddick back to prison. ""If you cut it with peppermint schnapps it goes away."" But the wiseguy dialogue doesn't conceal a certain soulful intelligence, even sadness, in Riddick. He's a real cool killer whose still waters run deep, not just another snarky asshole in the Schwarzenegger mold. When a Muslim cleric (Keith David) among the castaways accuses him of lacking faith, Riddick avers, ""I absolutely believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker."" Johns, Riddick, the imam, spacecraft captain Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell) and a motley handful of other renegades are the only survivors of a crash-landing on an unknown desert planet, where the combination of three suns means that night never falls. The crash sequence itself, which opens ""Pitch Black,"" is an electrifying thrill ride of chaotic digital animation and distorted photography, which lets you know right away that director David Twohy, cinematographer David Eggby and their collaborators are planning to kick out the jams. While struggling to find water and food on this harsh, apparently uninhabited sphere -- rendered by Eggby (who was, in fact, the cinematographer on ""Mad Max"") in harsh, surreal yellows and blues -- the gang makes a number of unhappy discoveries. There were humans, probably a team of geologists, living on the planet at one time, but something bad happened to them exactly 22 years earlier.

As the survivors navigate the harsh environment in search of resources and a means of escape, they uncover evidence of a previous human settlement that has mysteriously vanished. Their investigation reveals that the planet harbors lethal, nocturnal creatures dwelling underground, which emerge only during periods of darkness. Complicating matters further, the planet is on the cusp of a rare total eclipse, plunging the surface into prolonged darkness and unleashing the predatory inhabitants. Visual Aesthetics and Cinematic Techniques One of the film's standout features is its distinctive visual style. Cinematographer David Eggby employs a palette dominated by high-contrast lighting and saturated colors to depict the planet's perpetual daylight, resulting in surreal hues of yellow, blue, and orange that enhance the alien landscape's otherworldly feel. This creative use of color not only establishes a unique atmosphere but also serves to heighten the sense of isolation and vulnerability experienced by the characters. The transition from relentless daylight to the oppressive darkness of the eclipse is executed masterfully. As shadows lengthen and darkness envelops the terrain, the film's tone shifts dramatically, amplifying suspense and dread. The creatures, initially glimpsed only fleetingly, become an omnipresent menace, their echolocation clicks and sudden attacks keeping both the characters and the audience on edge. The decision to obscure the creatures in shadow, revealing just enough to evoke fear without overexposing them, aligns with the effective ""less is more"" philosophy seen in classic horror cinema. Compelling Performances and Character Arcs Vin Diesel's portrayal of Riddick is particularly noteworthy. He embodies the antihero archetype with a blend of menace and charisma, creating a character who is both feared and reluctantly relied upon by the other survivors.

295,XAD_Doc5_Pitch_Black,XAD_Doc5_Pitch_Black,XAD,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch_Black,"What distinguishes *Pitch Black* from its sci-fi contemporaries is its audacious inversion of horror conventions. Director David Twohy understands that terror flourishes not in the unknown, but in the inevitable. The film's opening act meticulously constructs a trap disguised as sanctuarya sun-scorched planet where perpetual daylight promises safety. Through brilliant production design, the environment itself becomes an antagonist: jagged salt flats reflect blinding light, cave systems hide fossilized warnings, and the very air shimmers with deceptive calm. This careful world-building pays dividends when the eclipse arrives, transforming the landscape into a claustrophobic labyrinth where every survival toolflashlights, glow sticks, even the characters' own breathbecomes a beacon for death. Twohy's decision to reveal the creatures' biology early (via an autopsy scene) amplifies tension rather than diminishing it; knowledge of their photophobic weakness makes the survivors' dwindling resources feel all the more urgent. Vin Diesel's career-defining performance as Riddick operates on multiple levels. Physically, he embodies a feral gracea panther-like economy of movement that makes his fight scenes feel less choreographed than instinctual. Yet it's the quieter moments that reveal the character's complexity: the way he absentmindedly fingers his shackles after escape, or his sardonic grin when realizing others need his ""monstrous"" abilities. The script smartly avoids romanticizing Riddick; his moral calculus remains self-interested until the final act, making his protective actions feel earned rather than contrived. Equally compelling is Radha Mitchell's Carolyn Fry, whose leadership role could have easily slipped into cliche. Mitchell portrays Fry's transformation with gritty realismher voice cracking not from fear, but from the weight of impossible decisions. The scene where she destroys the ship's manifest to hide her initial cowardice is a masterstroke of ethical ambiguity, grounding the film's high concept in human frailty. From a technical standpoint, *Pitch Black* remains a benchmark for atmospheric storytelling. The color gradingshifting from seared yellows to inky bluesvisually maps the characters' psychological journey. Editor Rick Shaine's use of match cuts between the three suns and characters' eyes creates subliminal unease, while composer Graeme Revell's score blends Middle Eastern motifs with industrial drones to mirror the collision of cultures aboard the Hunter-Gratzner. The creature design, though sparingly shown, demonstrates genius in its simplicity: bioluminescent veins outline their forms only when attacking, making each strike a terrifying flash of geometry. Practical effects dominate, particularly in the crash sequence where a rotating set and projected starfields create visceral disorientationa tactic later adopted in *Gravity*. Thematically, the film explores perception as both survival tool and prison. Riddick's eyesmodified to see in darknessmake him invaluable yet feared, a metaphor for society's treatment of those who deviate from norms. The Muslim pilgrims' storyline adds unexpected depth, contrasting Imam's spiritual resilience against Johns' nihilism. Even the creatures' light sensitivity becomes a narrative mirror: just as they're blinded by illumination, humans are paralyzed by moral ambiguity in crisis. In an era where sci-fi often prioritizes spectacle over subtext, *Pitch Black* dares to ask uncomfortable questions about whatand whowe deem monstrous.

Its modest performance nonetheless announced the arrival of Vin Diesel's action hero stardom; before this and Boiler Room (released on the same day as Pitch Black), Diesel's notable credits consisted of only a small supporting role in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and voicework on Brad Bird's animated gem The Iron Giant (1999). Twohy's movie didn't make Diesel a household name, but it's something both he and his fans have returned to over the years. Many discovered Pitch Black on home video, while Diesel later teamed with Twohy to continue the adventures of the movie's anti-hero, Riddick. Jim and Ken Wheat wrote the screenplay along with Twohy, and the result derives influence from every notable sci-fi classic of the last fifty years. The movie opens with a spacecraft moving steadily through the blackness of space, recalling those iconic shots from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and later Star Wars (1977). Space debris penetrates the hull, and the craft begins to descend into the atmosphere of a nearby planet. With the captain killed in the chaos, pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) considers jettisoning some forty passengers in cryo-sleep so she might survive. She doesn't, and in the ensuing crash, less than a dozen make it. Among the survivors are the Muslim Imam (Keith David), the would-be cop Johns (Cole Hauser), a boy named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), the antiquities dealer Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), and a detained killer named Richard B. Riddick (Diesel). Stranded on a desert planet that has three suns and perpetual sunlight, the survivors pool their resources and head out into the surrounding nothingness to search for water. But the search becomes secondary after the escape of Riddick, a killer whose murderous ways are confirmed by Johns and never denied in Riddick's monosyllabic retorts. Still, we know he's the hero because he's the one narrating. He's eventually caught after one of the survivors mysteriously dies, although he insists he's not responsible. ""All you people are so scared of me."" Diesel's character rumbles. ""Most days, I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now."" Indeed, traveling with Riddick as their captive, they come upon a leftover science camp in which they find no signs of human lifebut they do find large, carnivorous, nocturnal batlike creatures that remain hidden in a web of underground tunnels. Worse, as the camp's former geologists learned, they're about to witness a planetary eclipse that only occurs every 22 years and lasts nearly a month, meaning the dark-dwelling creatures can finally emerge from their slumber to feed. This nonsensical but otherwise intriguing idea comes with plenty of scientific questions, such as how do these"
297,XAD_Doc7_Pitch_Black,XAD_Doc7_Pitch_Black,XAD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"A busy screenwriter in Hollywood during the '80s and '90s, when he churned out various horror, science fiction, and action pictures (CRITTERS 2, WARLOCK, THE FUGITIVE, TERMINAL VELOCITY, WATERWORLD), David Twohy made his directorial debut with 1992's TIMESCAPE and followed up four years later with THE ARRIVAL, starring Charlie Sheen (during the decline in Sheen's movie stardom that eventually led him to turn to TV sit-comedy in the form of TWO AND A HALF MEN). THE ARRIVAL was an interesting take on the old alien invasion scenario, using the structure of a paranoid conspiracy thriller instead of the global destruction scene in INDEPENDENCE DAY the same year. However, the film lacked thrills and could not find an audience, even in an era primed for that kind of thing thanks to the popularity of THE X-FILES. After scripting G.I. JANE, Twohy returned to the directing chair with a script he rewrote from a draft by Jim & Ken Wheat. PITCH BLACK is another science fiction tale involving an alien menace, but this time the approach is of a more straightforward variety, emphasizing action and special effects; the result is a fairly efficient science fiction monster film, somewhat in the mold of an old 1950s B-movie. In fact, with its high concept premise, limited cast of characters, and isolated location, PITCH BLACK suggests an old fashioned Roger Corman production, but with improved production values, special effects and performances. The plot follows the survivors of a transport spaceship that crash-lands on an arid, desert world surrounded by three suns. It soon becomes apparent that some ravenously efficient predators decimated the planet, but they are confined to the darkness of underground tunnels. As fate would have it, the planet falls into the shadow of a solar eclipse once every twenty-two years, and (you guessed) the eclipse is due within hours. The film becomes a race against time as the characters struggle to repair an escape craft that will take them to safety. Needless to say, they don't make it in time, and find themselves having to outrun the voracious aliens eager to make a meal of them. With writing credits on WATERWORLD and TERMINAL VELOCITY, Twohy has a penchant for big action set pieces, often at the expense of a strong narrative. That problem doesn't arise here, as the simple story allows for a string of action scenes driven relentlessly forward by the characters' need to keep moving or die. As a director, Twohy also shows a good eye for the strong visual, one that is not just flashy but which has a genuine dramatic impact. Particularly memorable is the revelation that what looked like trees from a distance are actually the rib bones of dinosaur-sized skeletons strewn like some vast elephant's graveyard across the desert plain. Characterization is also reasonably strong for this kind of film, thanks to the help of the cast, particularly Vin Diesel, Claudia Black, and Cole Hauser. In the film's perverse moral scheme, we're supposed to relate to Diesel's"
298,XAD_Doc8_Pitch_Black,XAD_Doc8_Pitch_Black,XAD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"Is it an active contempt for the audience, I have to wonder, that propels a movie like Pitch Black through production, or is it mere laziness on the part of the filmmakers combined with the unspoken assumption  generally an accurate one  that moviegoers will watch just about anything with spaceships and lots of gore? Did some executive, considering greenlighting this script, chuckle evilly to himself while calculating precisely how insulting a movie he could produce and still have a decent opening weekend? Or was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was? ""Aliens meets The Fugitive meets Con Air,"" is probably how writer David N. Twohy pitched his script. (Also credited as writers are Jim and Ken Wheat, which simply screams of fanboy brothers who wrote and, god knows how, managed to sell a spec script that had to be even more horrendous than what's onscreen, if the more experienced Twohy had to rewrite it.) Twohy  who actually did write The Fugitive, with Jeb Stuart  is also responsible for writing and directing another piece of junk science fiction, The Arrival, which is at least enjoyable on a Mystery Science Theater level. With Pitch Black, though, he descends to a new level of awfulness, in which even the film's highly derivative nature cannot make for campy fun. Pitch Black is not good clean bad fun  it is an insidious offense to any even halfway-demanding movie fan. Pitch Black starts out, if not exactly promising, then at least momentarily gripping. A commercial freight and passenger ship, traveling through deep space, encounters a meteor storm  the small projectiles that rip through the ship are enough to do it serious damage, as well as kill the captain as he sleeps in his cryo chamber. The pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), awakened by the ship to deal with the emergency, finds her ship already burning up as it screams through the atmosphere of a planet. In an intense, protracted sequence, the ship breaks up as Fry fights for control of it and manages to guide it to a not entirely disastrous crash landing on the planet's surface. It's the kind of sequence at the end of which you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief along with the characters. But Pitch Black immediately thereafter starts a long slide downhill that doesn't stop until the end credits roll. Only a handful of the ship's passengers have survived, including Johns (Cole Hauser: Good Will Hunting), a law-enforcement type, and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel: The Iron Giant, Saving Private Ryan), a thoroughly psychotic multiple murderer who, natch, has escaped his industrial-strength restraints in the crash. Besides Fry, there's also a Muslim imam (Keith David: Armageddon, Volcano) and several of his young sons, a teenage boy, and sundry others. The planet, a seemingly lifeless, endless desert under brutal assault by three suns, fortunately has an atmosphere entirely"
299,XAD_Doc9_Pitch_Black,XAD_Doc9_Pitch_Black,XAD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"For a film that aspires to blend sci-fi grandeur with psychological depth, *Pitch Black* (2000) stumbles through its ambitions like its light-deprived characters fumbling in the dark. Director David Twohy's vision feels half-baked, caught between wanting to deconstruct genre tropes and succumbing to their laziest iterations. The much-praised opening crash sequence exemplifies this dissonance: while practical effects lend weight to the ship's disintegration, the editing descends into incoherence. Rapid cuts between screaming extras, sparking consoles, and CGI meteorites create confusion rather than tension. This lack of spatial awareness plagues the entire filmwhen characters later navigate cave systems or alien nests, the camera's refusal to establish clear geography reduces these scenes to a murky shuffle through indistinguishable sets. Twohy's decision to shoot the Australian outback as an alien landscape backfires spectacularly; without digital augmentation, the locales register as exactly what they area quarry with some odd rock formations. The triple suns concept, potentially rich for visual experimentation, is reduced to a gimmicky filter that bathes everything in migraine-inducing amber. Vin Diesel's Riddick, often cited as the film's saving grace, epitomizes its tonal confusion. Diesel's performance oscillates between lethargic growling and self-parody, his much-touted physical presence undermined by fight choreography that resembles a sleepwalker's tantrum. The script's attempts to complicate his antihero statusa child murderer with a soft spot for space nunsfeel less like moral ambiguity and more like narrative whiplash. Supporting characters fare worse: Radha Mitchell's Fry undergoes a 'transformation' from panicked survivor to noble leader with zero psychological scaffolding, while Cole Hauser's Johns devolves into a cartoonish villain twirling a metaphorical mustache. Keith David's Imam, the film's sole attempt at cultural representation, is reduced to spouting fortune-cookie mysticism (""You keep what you kill"") that the screenplay mistakes for profundity. Even the creatures lack personalitygeneric screeching arachnoids lifted from a dozen better-designed B-movies. Technically, the film is a catalog of missed opportunities. The infrared night vision sequences, while novel in 2000, now play like a poorly calibrated security camera feed. Marc Spicer's cinematography alternates between over-lit flatness and impenetrable shadows, with the eclipse sequencethe film's supposed centerpieceresembling a botched darkroom experiment. Sound design compounds these issues: the creatures' echolocation clicks, initially eerie, quickly become repetitive to the point of self-parody. Graeme Revell's score deserves particular scorn, its mishmash of pseudo-tribal chants and synth drones evoking a discount bin *Gladiator* (2000) knockoff. The much-lauded practical effects age poorly; the spaceship's interior looks like recycled *Alien* (1979) set pieces sprayed with silver paint, while the creature puppets' limited mobility kills any sense of threat. Thematic aspirations crash against the rocks of lazy execution. The film's central metaphordarkness revealing true natureis hammered home with sledgehammer subtlety. Riddick's night vision becomes a cheap symbol for moral clarity, yet the script contradicts itself: he's simultaneously a ruthless killer and a protector of children, with no coherent throughline. The Muslim pilgrims' subplot, potentially rich material, is treated with embarrassing superficialitytheir faith exists solely to be contrasted against Johns' cynicism in painfully obvious dialectics. Even the ecological angle"
300,XAD_Doc10_Pitch_Black,XAD_Doc10_Pitch_Black,XAD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"Beneath its veneer of gritty realism, *Pitch Black* (2000) is a Frankenstein's monster of stolen ideas and squandered potential. David Twohy's direction exhibits all the nuance of a sledgehammer, reducing what could have been a taut survival thriller into a parade of illogical character decisions and pseudoscientific babble. The film's structure collapses under its own weight: an interminable first act drowns in exposition about solar cycles and cryo-sleep biology, only to abandon these concepts once the monster chase begins. Pacing issues plague every framethe 109-minute runtime feels twice as long, bloated by redundant 'tense' standoffs and characters reciting their backstories like therapy patients. Twohy's attempts at visual flair, particularly the tri-solar lighting, result in a monochromatic eyesore where actors squint uncomfortably at nothing. His action sequences lack rhythm or coherence; the much-hyped final battle devolves into a murky mess of shaky cam and CGI blood spatters that would embarrass a SyFy original movie. Characterization reaches new lows in sci-fi annals. Vin Diesel's Riddick isn't a complex antiherohe's a collection of edgy teenager doodles: shaved head, glowing eyes, and a voice that sounds like gravel in a blender. The script's attempts to add depth (a hinted-at tragic past, vague references to prison experiments) are laughably half-baked, existing solely to justify his sudden shift from killer to savior. Radha Mitchell's Fry suffers worseher 'leadership' consists of alternating between screaming and making decisions so idiotic they border on suicidal (e.g., splitting the group *after* establishing that strength lies in numbers). Cole Hauser's Johns is a walking plot device, his motivations shifting from greed to revenge to generic madness depending on the scene. Minor characters are outright offensive stereotypes: the Arab cleric spouting proverbs, the hysterical Frenchman, the tough lesbian pilotall lifted from a 1980s VHS bargain bin. Technologically, the film is a disaster. The infrared POV shots, intended as a groundbreaking technique, instead create a visual disconnectwe're told Riddick sees heat signatures, yet the monochrome images lack any thermal logic (why do rocks glow but not weapons?). The creature effects, a mix of rubber suits and rudimentary CGI, fail to convince even by 2000 standards; their attacks lack weight or physicality, resembling Halloween haunted house jump scares. Production design reeks of cost-cutting: the 'alien' caves are clearly plywood sets with glitter glue stalactites, while the spaceship's cockpit looks like a rejected *Star Trek* TNG prop. Even basic continuity errors aboundcharacters' wounds magically heal between scenes, the suns' positions shift inconsistently, and the eclipse's duration defies all astronomical logic. The sound mix drowns dialogue in unnecessary reverb, forcing viewers to choose between hearing whispers or being deafened by sudden screeches. Thematic aspirations dissolve into pretentious mush. The film wants to explore 'humanity's darkness' but reduces this to Riddick occasionally not murdering someone. Its treatment of faith (via Imam's character) is shockingly shallowa few Quran quotes and a prayer scene do not constitute meaningful engagement with spirituality. The ecological messagethat the planet's creatures maintain balance through periodic cullingis introduced then immediately ignored in favor of"
301,XDM_Doc1_Taxi,XDM_Doc1_Taxi,XDM,Action,Negative,Taxi,"""What makes seemingly urgent American subjects go bad? Perhaps when the subject is approached by people less mindful of what it might mean than Europe's leading art-film directors. The impetus for Martin Scorsese's new film Taxi Driver, ironically, came from that impeccably American source, Paul Schrader, whose script was hammered out ""in five mad days"" as emotional therapy after an insomniac drunken spree. That might not in itself be disqualifying, but the script is so steeped in holy violence that no director with less than the most conceptually rigorous mind or the steadiest taste in details could keep it from degenerating into cheap gore and pseudo-mythic posturing. And Scorsese does not have that mind or taste. The trouble is not that the film is too violent, but rather that violence is treated as some sort of holy communion by a God obviously modeled on Sam Peckinpah. The notion that violence is the ultimate sacrament of American life may have a certain small and savage verity. But it is also inescapably a cliche, except, possibly, when it is observed and analyzed from far outside the American mainstream. Martin Scorsese is well within that mainstream, which is one of the film's basic contrarieties. Another is that the holy violence is performed by an essentially unholy creep. The creep is Travis Bickle, ex-Marine, ex-something else as well, presumably, since this is Vietnam time. He drives a taxi, sees life's turpitude, is outraged by it, but is also inextricably part of it. He visits porno palaces, picks up girls who are presumably only illusions of cleanliness, tries to approach one in his taxi, but can't; gradually, he evolves into a psychotic avenger, hell-bent on cleaning up the city. The premise is not wholly worthless, though it has been used quite frequently as an excuse for do-it-yourself gore. The question is how well you realize it. The answer from Schrader and Scorsese is: with ultimate glitz and show-off cheapness. Travis is ""played"" by Robert De Niro, who first tries to ingratiate himself with a girl who works for a Presidential primary candidate, but whothough obviously teased by Travis's freakishnesssoon dispenses with him. Thus Travis becomes triple-lonely, fueled by lust for her, hatred for her rejection, and a nascent fatherly raptness for a sweet teenage prostitute named Iris, whom he hopes to rescue from the street. She is a fifteen-year-old runaway under the thumb of a slick pimp ironically named Sport, who calls her ""baby"" all the time. She doesn't want to be rescued, but Travis keeps trying. Meanwhile, he accumulates a private arsenal: guns, knives, mohawk haircutall the paraphernalia of the avenging angel. The final spree is indeed as Sam Peckinpah might have shot it: bullets, blood, moans, whimpering, unstoppable violence. The trouble is that it is all for nothing, except perhaps the ephemeral gratification of cinematic gore freaks. The city is not changed by it, Travis is not purged by it, the plot is not advanced by it, the viewer is not illuminated by"

The comedian, who has been at Tina Fey's mercy as an anchor on Saturday Night Live but left the sketch show this season to pursue movie stardom, is overshadowed by the comedic talents of Queen Latifah, Ann?Margret and Jennifer Esposito in his jump to the big screen. While he isn't terrible in the film per se, you rarely find yourself laughing because he just isn't much of a comedic presence here. Fallon plays a hapless rookie beat cop named Washburn, who has had his license suspended (Esposito takes him as a lover, albeit off?screen). He manages to prove himself incompetent by leaving a perp behind and trying to chase a getaway driver on foot, shooting out his own tires in the process. Latifah  who, to be fair, does her best to be humorous, playing a New York City cabbie fired from her messenger-courier job  is roped into driving him around. The idea is to mix fish?out?of?water buddy comedy with action, but it all results in a disjointed, forgettable flick. Over the course of these asinine plot devices (the kind of inbredly moronic material the film embraces in its own absurdity), you get criminals  four charming, foxlike women  and over?the?top action. The conceit is that these beautiful girls are bank robbers. Gisele Bundchen is the leader of the pack, scantily clad in T?shirts and short?shorts. Henry Simmons (the Barbershop hottie) also appears as Fallon's best friend. The criminals pull off a standard crime spree with car chases, culminating in a bland final chase. Directed by Tim Story, working from a premise by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Transporter), Taxi wastes any real comedic logic. Fallon's Washburn is so recklessly inept that it goes beyond comedic plausibility. For a rookie cop, he's missing the most basic training that should keep him from obvious slip?ups. The film is laden with the usual buddy?cop cliches  incompetent detective, reluctant partner, and so on. It's no wonder the comedic timing never quite finds its stride, except for a few genuinely funny moments from Queen Latifah. As for Latifah, her character is written as an aspiring NASCAR driver with a heavily souped?up taxi, to the point that her trunk is outfitted with racing seat covers, nitrous tanks, and so on. It's fun to watch her pop the trunk to reveal all this gear. But the scenes never pay off well enough, as if the production relies solely on the novelty of ""a hot?rod taxi"" without weaving it into consistently strong comedy or action sequences. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is the script's disinterest in building a real buddy relationship. Fallon and Latifah spend the film verbally sparring, but it's seldom truly funny or heartfelt. Instead, you get the sense the movie is just making them bicker for the sake of contrived"
303,XDM_Doc3_Taxi,XDM_Doc3_Taxi,XDM,Action,Negative,Taxi,"""Released in France almost 20 years ago to the day, the original Taxi movie quickly became a national sensation. Conceived and produced by Luc Besson, the $8 million Marseilles-set action comedy raked in more then eight times its budget at the worldwide box office back in 1998, launching the careers of its two stars  not to mention its young co-star, Marion Cotillard  while spawning three successful sequels over the next decade. (This doesn't include the woeful 2004 American remake, starring Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon in roles they'd probably like to erase from their IMDb pages.) Even if each new film proved to be more or less worse than its predecessor, there was a certain charm to the Taxi franchise's cartoonish melange of slapstick humor, gonzo road stunts and recurring gags involving a bunch of nincompoop cops and the one badass cab driver who constantly steps in to save the day. Sort of like The Fast and the Furious, but with less action  although Taxi 2 did the car-parachuting-from-an-airplane stunt a long time before Furious 7  and as if everyone both behind and in front of the camera had taken way too many drugs, the movies had a fun-and-dumb approach to the genre that worked on its own B-grade level. 'La Ch'tite famille': Film Review Back for another go at it after more than 10 years, but with a new cast toplined by actor-director Franck Gastambide, Taxi 5 comes rolling into French theaters and winds up driving straight off a cliff. Yes, this literally happens during a big chase toward the end of the film  but the film itself is truly a five-car pileup of a comedy, with jokes hitting the lowest common denominator and then hitting the ground, and a director at the helm who doesn't seem to know the first thing about his craft. Not that the other Taxi flicks were comic masterpieces, but compared to this one they look like they were made by Billy Wilder at the height of his powers. Still, local fans should turn out for some of the mayhem, although not necessarily in droves this time. Gastambide created and starred in the banlieue web series Kaira Shopping, which he followed up with two terrible tie-in features, Porn in the Hood and Pattaya. Both films grasped at the most low-hanging fruits possible, and Taxi 5 does much of the same, with a litany of lame penis jokes, sexist gags about a horny and overweight female officer (at one point she's tossed off a bridge to stop a moving car), one scene involving a little person being used as a battering ram, and a character whose entire comic routine consists of staring at people cross-eyed. The humor is cringe-worthy for the most part, with maybe one or two mild laughs, and since nothing else in the movie  plot, character, the stunt sequences, a cameo by a French rap star  really works, it can be a long and painful"

The plot is limp  bumbling cop and lead footed new cabbie chase down four bank robbers who also happen to be Brazilian super models (although their reasons for the robberies remains as elusive as their desire for long-sleeved clothing). As a result you get action sequences punctuated with mismatched characters, neither of whom is particularly engaging. Latifah comes off better, having done movie comedy before and playing to her usual sassy strength  she's the kind of girl that's hard not to like, but even she struggles to get a laugh out of the all too thin material here that's begging for comedy and failing almost every time. Worse still, the pairing of her with Fallon's character seems so forced and hard to swallow that the much needed buddy chemistry so standard to these movies is just non-existent. Fallon on the other hand is a big disappointment. He's been a sort of fun guy on SNL but he's just not a crossover movie comedian I'm sorry. The pale sweaty Fallon mugs constantly at the camera, trying desperately for laughs when just a simpler and more relaxed air about him would be so much better. Esposito as his ex turned boss holds her own far better, whilst the stunning looking Gisele Bundchen as the robbery leader has little to say but proves better than you'd expect for a first time beauty onscreen. Ann Margaret provides the few genuine chuckles as Fallon's margarita-soaked mother. Kudos has to go to the action choreographer. The chase scenes look spectacular, kicking off with an awesome bike sprint through crowded Manhattan subways, trains, over bridge holes and amidst oncoming traffic. The scene helps set the pace for the over the top chases which fly through the streets with pace. The trouble here though is that it's all so unbelievable  Latifah's cab and the robber's red BMW drive around downtown Manhattan streets at top speed without once hitting a traffic jam let alone any major crowds or obstacles short of the occasional garbage truck.

Along the way, we meet Washburn's mom, a tipsy type played without embarrassment by Ann-Margret. To watch the still-fiery redhead slurp margaritas and utter lame ""jungle fever"" jokes is to wish Hollywood would respect its elders.

Now she's back in a star vehicle along with a comedian ready to break out on his own. Jimmy Fallon has been known to many as a member of NBC's Saturday Night Live and now he's starring with a well known actor/comedian/singer. Together, the two of them star in """"Taxi"""", a film that has plenty of action, laughs, and sex appeal. While the film has the look of a cliche buddy movie, Latifah and Fallon bring in their own flair of comedic skills to make a difference and take you on a New York joyride. Set in New York City, Belle (Queen Latifah) is a speed freak, in the vehicle sense. Initially a bike messenger, she takes pride in that she can run her errands in record fashion. When her time comes, she quits that job and gets her taxi driver license. On the eve of her first day of work, she fixes her yellow cab with some installments rather than spend time with her boyfriend (Simmons). Andy Washburn (Fallon) is a bumbling cop trying to make a big case stick. He's also a terrible driver. When his skills behind the wheel crashes into a food market and lets some criminals escape, his boss, Lt. Marta Robbins (Esposito) isn't pleased as she confiscates his license to drive.

Convincing Belle to help him out, Andy has no idea what he's in stored when he gets in her car. Belle can get anywhere in record time, but sometimes that works against her when dealing with beautiful criminals. While some of the jokes don't make everyone laugh, there are enough to keep you entertained. Queen Latifah takes the lead and flies with it. Her chemistry with Fallon isn't always on point but as the film moves on, it develops. Fallon, in his lead role, is somewhat bland as a comic. Some of his humor works and some don't. The cliche scene were the two of them start talking about their lives is dull and has no pay off. What works are the action scenes involving the cars.

Since being arrested in 2010, jailed and later sentenced to house arrest (he can now move about more freely, but is still forbidden from leaving Iran), Mr Panahi has produced three films on shoestring budgets that brilliantly use his own circumstance to describe the condition of an artist under theocracy. In This Is Not a Film (2011) and Closed Curtain (2013), Panahi explored the dark nights of the soul induced by house arrest, but in Taxi Tehran (5*, No Cert, IFI, 82mins) he's out and about, playing a fictionalised version of himself who's now comically reduced to working as a cabbie. As he travels the city Panahi is recognised as a celebrity by customers who then become embarrassed on his behalf. The film's conceit is that he shoots them with a static security camera, and as the punters come and go they give us an intriguing snapshot of contemporary Iran. The characters he meets are often comic, sometimes tragic. When two old ladies get in carrying a goldfish in a bowl, chaos inevitably ensues, and the film's funniest moments involve a peddler of western DVDs who in Iran's stern theocracy is forced to act like a drug dealer. Darker moments come when he picks up an old friend, a female lawyer disbarred for thought crimes, and they discuss the case of a woman jailed for trying to attend a men's volleyball game. Beautifully balanced, cheerful but incisive, Taxi Tehran is playful, but also deadly serious. In the mid-1960s a radical group emerged in urban America that put a bomb under race relations. The Black Panthers began as a kind of armed self-defence unit, and were formed to tackle persistent police brutality in the northern Californian city of Oakland. There, the almost exclusively white police force were notorious for their harassment of young black men, and radical students Huey P. Nelson and Bobby Seale formed the Panthers to follow the cops around and intervene whenever they stopped black people. Thanks to a loophole in Californian law, they were free to bear arms, and later used them to stage a dramatic protest at the California state assembly. That stunt brought them to public attention, but also in sights of J. Edgar Hoover, who vowed to bring them down. Stanley Nelson Jr spent seven years amassing his documentary Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution (4*, No Cert, IFI, 115mins), talking to as many Panthers veterans as he could to try and present a balanced view of a movement whose legacy is still bitterly contested. The Panthers' confused manifesto included shades of Marxism, Leninism and the black nationalist theories of Malcolm X, and to begin with they were a force for good in many poor communities. But the movement's descent into violence and corruption was swift and fatal, as Mr. Nelson's fine film painstakingly"

After making several robust realist dramas about the challenges of everyday life in his country  among them The Circle, Crimson Gold and the exuberantly angry football movie Offside  Panahi fell foul of the Iranian government, which threatened him with imprisonment, prevented him from travelling and banned him from making films for 20 years. He has protested by working under the wire to make three extraordinary works, contraband statements that are at once a cri de coeur from internal exile, and a bring-it-on raised fist of defiance. This Is Not a Film (2011, directed with Mojtaba Mirtahmasb) showed Panahi cooling his heels under house arrest in his Tehran flat, and evoking the film that he would have made had he been allowed to pick up a camera. He wasn't technically making an actual film, Panahi argued  yet he was manifestly making one anyway, as the world saw when the result was smuggled to Cannes on a USB stick hidden in a cake. However, the less successful Closed Curtain (2013, directed with Kambuzia Partovi) was a claustrophobically self-referential chamber piece, and suggested that Panahi's plight was getting the better of him. However, his survivor spirit and delight in cinema's possibilities have endured, and re-emerge to sparkling effect in Taxi Tehran (or plain Taxi, as it was called when it won the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin film festival). For this spare, witty exercise, Panahi rigged a taxi with three hidden video cameras and surreptitiously filmed a drive round Tehran, with himself at the wheel ferrying assorted passengers  presumably actors for the most part. One assumes that everything is staged; such is the feel of brisk spontaneity that it's hard to tell. Taxi Tehran - video review, featuring Panahi's real-life niece Hana, herself an aspiring film-maker Guardian One assumes that everything is staged; such is the feel of brisk spontaneity that it's hard to tell The first two passengers are a man who grumbles about tyre thieves, and proposes to hang them all, and a woman who objects that Iran hardly needs more executions. Brusquely, the man tries to silence her  ""Law and sharia have spoken... so chill out, lady""  before exiting with a comment that casts ironic light on his self-righteousness. Eventually revealed in the driving seat, Panahi himself is soon recognised by another fare, who suspects that he's shooting a film, and that the previous passengers were actors. Things now get pretty self-reflexive: a short, stout customer identifies himself as Omid the DVD bootlegger. He's the man who keeps Tehran supplied with Woody Allen and The Walking Dead, but he's also probably local viewers' only conduit to Panahi's own work; this Danny DeVito-like character may be a bumptious clown, but he's a genuine hero of samizdat distribution.

Panahi is indeed sitting in a driver's seat, as the entire film is shot from a dashboard cam, ""Taxicab Confessions""-style, as he tools around Tehran in a fake taxicab. But he's also in the driver's seat in another way. The politically outspoken Panahi (""""Crimson Gold,"""" """"Offside"""") was found guilty by Iranian authorities in 2010 of making ""propaganda against the regime,"" and sentenced to a 20-year ban on making films, doing interviews or leaving the country. He made his last two films, ""This is Not A Film"" and ""Closed Curtain"" while under house arrest, smuggling the footage on USB sticks out of the country. While those films were tense and claustrophobic, ""Taxi"" feels freer, even cheerful. Perhaps emboldened by the success of the last two films (and the fact that he wasn't jailed for making them), Panahi ventures outside with ""Taxi,"" making an entire 80-minute movie inside a moving vehicle. The film has its Madison premiere at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, 227 State St., as part of its Spotlight Cinema fall series. The film is a mix of documentary and fiction, teasing the audience about where to draw the line between the two. Panahi plays himself pretending to be a cab driver, picking up and dropping off passengers as he drives around the city. (His sense of direction is awful, but what do you expect from someone living under house arrest?) As we meet the passengers, including a husband and wife who were just in a terrible car accident, a bootleg DVD merchant, and Panahi's precocious young niece, it becomes clear that these are actors and not normal Iranian citizens. (In an inspired bit of ""meta"" filmmaking, the DVD merchant even notices the camera and ""accuses"" Panahi of secretly making a movie.In an inspired bit of ""meta"" filmmaking, the DVD merchant even notices the camera and ""accuses"" Panahi of secretly making a movie.) While some of the scenes are a bit stage-y, the result is a playful film that explores a cross-section of Iranian society in 2015, from criminals to dissidents to everyday citizens who play by the rules. Especially relevant is Panahi's exchanges with his niece, who is taking a filmmaking class where the teacher lists all the things that are forbidden in Iranian cinema, such as ""sordid realism."" Panahi, of course, has violated all these things and more. To protect his cast and crew from persecution, the credits to ""Taxi"" are blank, and only Panahi's name appears on the film.

Comedies truly are my comfort movie genre when I'm looking for a little rest and relaxation to either kick-off or end my weekend. Comedies are the type of movies that can be viewed as going to a fast food restaurant. The food is easy to digest, they are loved by the people, and there is always something new on the menu to try. Let's just say I took a trip to my favorite theater and ordered The Lost City special and I can't get enough. They say laughter is good for the soul and I wholeheartedly agree. I went in blind when I went to see this movie and I'm glad that I did. I loosely knew the concept of the movie prior, but at the time it didn't look interesting to me. I thought this was one of your standard, generic comedies that somehow got approved by Hollywood. I didn't give this movie a second thought after viewing the trailer, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. I'm not sure if it was the plot or the fact that this movie was filled with talented actors such as Daniel Radcliffe, Sandra Bullock, and Channing Tatum, but something drew me to this film and I'm glad it did. The plot of this film is very straightforward and tells you exactly what the story of the movie will be. Loretta (Bullock) gets tangled up with her cover model Alan (Tatum) on a quest to find the lost treasure of an ancient city led by the antagonist of the film Abigail Fairfax (Radcliffe). When it comes to comedies, I feel as though a lot of the plot can get lost in translation and bogged down by too many jokes but with The Lost City, I found that it was easy to follow along and the line delivery was hitting on every level. It felt as if this movie was tailor-made for me. Every joke landed so well and I found myself falling in love with dialogue. The script was snappy, witty, and quippy and made me chuckle more than a few times. I was thoroughly surprised by a few of the performances of The Lost City. It has been some time since I've seen Daniel Radcliffe on screen, but I think that the comedy scene is right up his alley. I know it's hard to associate him with anything else outside of Harry Potter. However, I think this type of role could work for him in future projects. Channing Tatum's character was pegged as the ""attractive dumb one"" but he always brought a smile to my face. I believe that this is one of my favorite performances by him in ages. As much as I enjoyed him in the Jumpstreet films, this is probably his best performance by far. And I have to give a special shoutout to Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt).

312,XNT_Doc2_Lost_city,XNT_Doc2_Lost_city,XNT,Comedy,Positive,Lost_city,"The Lost City is a terrific throwback to studio romcoms of the 90s and 00s, with two true-blue movie star performances from Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. As superhero films strengthened their grip on the industry, one of the first genres for studios to no longer deem a ""theatrical necessity"" was the romantic comedy. Nowadays, most people get their romcom fix from Netflix (Set it Up, Always Be My Maybe, etc.) but there was a time  not so long ago  when movies like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, and Pretty Woman could pair a couple of movie stars (Will Smith, Julia Roberts, etc.) with a creative concept and make nearly $200 million at the domestic box office, packing in crowds like a Marvel movie. Cut to 2022 and, extraordinary exceptions like 2018's Crazy Rich Asians aside, most romcoms simply can't compete with the IP-driven titles that have theaters in a chokehold; despite being critically acclaimed, 2017's The Big Sick and 2019's Long Shot, for instance, barely registered with average audiences. However, that doesn't mean some romcom aficionados aren't still trying to keep the genre alive. Just this February, we saw the release of the Jennifer Lopez's Marry Me (co-starring Loki's Owen Wilson as her mismatched love interest), and the multihyphenate even has another due for June  Shotgun Wedding, co-starring Transformers' Josh Duhamel. But, before that, this month brings us the long-awaited The Lost City, which not only gives Sandra Bullock yet another starring role in one of the genres she's most famous for (While You Were Sleeping, The Proposal, you know the rest) but also, along with last month's Dog, serves as co-star Channing Tatum's triumphant return to live-action cinema, having been absent since 2017's Kingsman: The Golden Circle. On paper, The Lost City looks like the kind of thing that used to be Hollywood's bread-and-butter  a old-fashioned ""movie movie"" based around an original idea and led by two mega stars with clearly defined public personas who lure in audiences despite the lack of IP. And, in execution, it's every bit the exuberant big-screen entertainment you'd expect it to be. We start on Loretta Sage (Bullock), a dissatisfied, middle-aged author who, following the death of her husband and her inability to publish a book on their archeological findings, turned to writing romance-adventure novels centered around a beautiful and brooding fictional hero named Dash (who is given a vibrant visage by clueless cover model Alan Caprison, played by Tatum). But now, Loretta's found herself in a rut; aside from rarely (if ever) leaving her house, she's grown disenchanted with the series as a whole, and she wants this latest book  which she's about to leave for a book tour on  to be her last. That doesn't sit well with Alan (who relies on this job since he can't really do anything else) and her brassy publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, of Dolemite Is My Name and Office Christmas Party), but before they can voice"

And one of the loveliest ways to experience that embrace is in the dark surrounded by strangers*, with popcorn in your lap and the warmth of a cinema screen brightening your eyes and mood. It takes an unabashedly funny film to unite a room in laughter, happily The Lost City is just that. (*No strangers were embraced during the making of this opinion) Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a solitary soul. Once a globe trotter with a passion for breathing new life into ancient history, Loretta withdrew from the world following the death of her husband and has settled for living vicariously through the antics of her characters. Her hero Dash McMahon makes all her readers swoon but thanks to the dedication of a hunky cover model he has taken on a life of his own. If Loretta is ever to get a life, Dash must die. Dash is everything to Alan (Channing Tatum). Before he donned the flowing locks and disposable shirts demanded of Loretta's leading man he was a nobody, he won't go back to anonymity without a fight. Not an actual punch-up  Alan is a lover, not a fighter  but he is fiercely loyal to the author and the franchise and carefully oblivious to her disdain. Soon it will be time for Alan to step up and prove his mettle, a mercurial billionaire has Loretta in his crosshairs and (to her great irritation) the next chapter could prove deadly. Media dynasty brat Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is basically Roman Roy with a childhood fixation on his Indiana Jones boxset. And now that he's a grown-up, Fairfax wants ALL the treasure. Loretta's meticulous research for her novel took her perilously close to the Crown of Fire  Fairfax's quarry  and one translation, in particular, makes her an invaluable asset to him. When his ultimate cheese board fails to charm, he simply has his henchmen deliver Loretta to a remote Atlantic Island where he plans to stamp his foot extra hard until she complies. But Fairfax's cunning plan did not account for Alan! Comparisons to Romancing the Stone are obviously inescapable here and superficially The Lost City shares plenty of common ground with the '80s classic. Yet it is so much more than that; part Nim's Island, part The Lego Movie, a bit Dora and the Lost City of Gold and obviously a lot Indy; the real secret to The Lost City's appeal is the winning charm of its cast. Adam and Aaron Nee's action caper might not bring anything revelatory to the table in terms of plot but it's a deliciously fluffy comedy confection and the charisma is palpable. Brad Pitt and Da'Vine Joy Randolph steal every scene they're in as a CIA operative tasked with recovering Loretta and her dedicated publicist, respectively, Bullock and Tatum have fabulous bickering chemistry and honestly everyone looks like they're having a ball.

Sometimes you just have to throw flowers at the feet of a movie's casting team. Whoever came up with the idea to unite Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum as an unlikely comedy double act deserves all of the praise in the world. The Lost City catches fire from the first minute thanks to its central duo, hitting comic high note after comic high note. In terms of pure fun, this might just be one of the most joyous cinema experiences of the year so far. Bullock is romance novelist Loretta Sage, who pens lurid adventure tales inspired by her past love of archaeology. As she puts it, ""it's real history. I merely season it with a bit more nudity."" Alan Caprison (Tatum) is her dim-witted cover model, donning a ludicrous blonde wig and determined to maintain people's belief that he's a real hero. The release of Loretta's latest novel The Lost City of D inspires eccentric billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) to kidnap her in the hope that she can lead him to the real lost city and its associated treasures. Alan sees a chance to find the real hero within and bring Loretta home. It's the perfect scaffolding for a silly adventure movie of the kind that's really having a moment on the big screen of late, whether it's Uncharted, the surprisingly excellent recent Dora the Explorer film or any of those movies where The Rock wears khaki in a jungle. Sibling directing duo the Nee Brothers put the narrative pedal to the floor early on, with Alan and Loretta stranded together in the wilderness when the attempt to rescue her doesn't quite go according to plan. Bullock holds the movie together with a performance of exquisite comic timing, saddled with a ludicrous, glittery pink one-piece which couldn't be less suitable for the jungle. She has terrific comic chemistry with Tatum, who has found the perfect vehicle for the himbo charm he has so often harnessed on the big screen, including in the Magic Mike movies. You can't decide whether you want to sleep with him or read him a bedtime story. He might be thick enough to comment that Loretta should ""visit Ancient Greece"" if she wants to relax, but he also radiates big-hearted warmth and is lovable enough that the budding romance between the duo is utterly believable.The third key cast member is something of a wildcard, with Radcliffe again leaning in to his propensity for playing over-cranked weirdos. It's a register in which the former boy wizard excels, giving Fairfax a jittery unpredictability which makes him as dangerous as he is funny. Even when his villainy goes up another level to inject further stakes into the third act, Radcliffe's intense mania finds room to accommodate it. Given his next role is as the musician Weird Al Yankovic, it's fair to say there's plenty more room for"
315,XNT_Doc5_Lost_city,XNT_Doc5_Lost_city,XNT,Comedy,Positive,Lost_city,"The Lost City is one of those high-concept ideas where the plot is ridiculous, but it doesn't matter because the movie gets every other element right. It puts its characters in a situation for silly reasons and gets them out of it for even sillier reasons, but just about everything that happens in between is wonderful. The film takes a weak concept and throws everything it can at it, including three A-list stars, an against-type villain, a supporting cast full of scene-stealers, witty dialogue, and action sequences that are better-staged than you'd expect. It's an extended riff on Romancing the Stone, another treasure-hunting movie where the heroine was a romance novelist. The Lost City was directed by Adam and Aaron Nee and written by the Nees along with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox. A fifth writer, Seth Gordon, the director of the sublime documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, gets a ""story by"" credit. That's the sort of credits that often indicate a film was in development forever and re-written repeatedly, but this one turned out well. Sandra Bullock plays Loretta Sage, a romance novelist who's very successful, even though she hates what she does, and would rather be on the Indiana Jones-like architectural adventures she used to take with her late husband. Channing Tatum plays the Fabio-like cover model on the books; Loretta resents that this blond-wigged himbo is more popular than she is. Before long, Loretta's kidnapped, for convoluted reasons, by ""Abigail Fairfax"" (Daniel Radcliffe), who's seeking a treasure on a remote island, which Loretta mentioned in one of her novels. Radcliffe's character also has a Fredo Corleone-like motivation where he's angry that his media mogul father passed him over in favor of his brother, in a running gag that never pays off. Tatum's cover model decides to attempt a rescue mission, and in doing so he enlists a Special Forces pal (Brad Pitt). Pitt's appearance was in all the trailers, so it's no secret, while his lack of top billing should be an indication of how long his character sticks around. Pitt's stretch in the film is its best stretch. Most of the movie is a race across the jungle towards the treasure, while in a parallel plot, Loretta's publicist (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) is working to rescue them, with the help of a social media assistant (I Think You Should Leave's hilarious Patti Harrison) and later a horndog pilot (The Office veteran Oscar Nunez, who played a similar part in the previous Bullock vehicle The Proposal.) These supporting actors all get chances to shine, especially for a movie driven by star power. I never cared about the treasure plot, and get the sense that the film didn't either. You're there to see Tatum and Bullock, whose banter is hilarious and whose chemistry is crackling. The film also draws a lot of comedy from Tatum's physicality: Just because he has the physique of a badass Army man, and could plausibly pass as one, he's a"

To me, it felt like it started off as a prank, where one of them might have suggested an idea of roping in Brad Pitt for a super-cool cameo as a sexy, undercover guy named Jack Trainer in what would essentially be an unofficial remake of Robert Zemeckis' gleefully pulpy but wholly watchable action-adventure ""Romancing the Stone."" Then, they might have decided to cast the super-dashing Channing Tatum to play out an extension of his dumbfoolery from the Jump Street movies, and Sandra Bullock as well, Sandra Bullock from all her 90s movies. The result would make a fairly entertaining movie that would glide along on their chemistry alone. However, what we do get here is an over-stretched, unfunny, and terribly written film that doesn't know if it wants to be a treasure hunt adventure, a reworking of the damsel in distress trope, a moving-on from a grief tale, or a rom-com that ends with a kiss. Anyway, Bullock stars as Loretta, a reclusive novelist who writes these pulpy treasure hunting adventures that are less treasure hunting and more of a sexually charged romance between Angela and Dash (the main characters from her book). We meet her first in the midst of her frustration as she dodges her agent Beth's (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) calls to finish the final chapter of her new book. We get to know that it has been 5 years since her husband passed away, and instead of moving on, she has decided to limit her interactions. This is why, a book tour that involves interacting with people in a body-hugging-sparkly-jump-suit-dress, has to be the last place she wants to be. However, when there, we also meet Dash (basically Channing Tatum's Alan donning fake blond hair), who apparently has a thing for her, but is unable to connect because of a sort of intellectual shield that Loretta has built around her. Alan, who considers himself dumb is unable to traverse around that But, before things could get sex-cringe, Loretta is kidnapped by some hoodlums who apparently work for Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). Please note that this character makes sure to tell us that this is a gender-neutral name and that you are not allowed to make fun of it (Me: It's 2022, and no one is making fun of it anymore). Anyway, Abigail tries to reason with Loretta about a piece of key information in her book that might help him find some sort of hidden treasure, but Loretta, who has left reading cryptic messages since her husband died, is reluctant and uptight. So, our baddy decides to drug her (note that this character likes cheese for no reason whatsoever) and fly her to the middle of the Atlantic.

When did Hollywood decide that all globe-trotting adventures have to be extremely stupid? In the 1980s, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Romancing the Stone"" weren't chicken soup for the moron's soul. Neither was the much more recent ""National Treasure,"" starring Nicolas Cage. However, the dumb new movie ""The Lost City"" joins ""Uncharted,"" ""Jungle Cruise"" and ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"" in the discouraging trend of demeaning a once-great genre with nauseating humor, no thrills or grandeur and an over-reliance on star power. Running time: 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence and some bloody images, suggestive material, partial nudity and language.) In theaters. The wasted celeb here is Sandra Bullock, who plays a widowed romance novelist not unlike her abrasive, pseudo-feminist character from ""Miss Congeniality."" Named Loretta Sage, she doesn't concern herself with men anymore, wants to stay out of the spotlight and would rather be drinking chardonnay in the tub. Too bad then that she's forced to tour with her dim-witted Fabio-like cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) who rips off his shirt onstage to delight the ladies. After one book tour talk, she's kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) and the movie goes loopy. The smarmy gent realizes that her books' setting, the tropical Lost City of D, is real and holds a hidden treasure. He needs her  and chloroform  to help him find the loot. A billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) tries to convince a romance author (Sandra Bullock) to help him find a lost treasure. Directors Aaron and Adam Nee's movie sits frustratingly for two hours on the tarmac of comedy as we the angry passengers await takeoff. Precious few jokes land, and the accidental safari scenes, with Bullock peeling leeches off Tatum's butt or briefly running through the trees with a cameo-ing Brad Pitt, are annoying and obvious. The funniest people in the film have nothing to do with Loretta and Alan's island antics. Da'Vine Joy Randolph plays Beth, an exhausted, can't-take-it-anymore literary agent, and Patti Harrison is the aging social media intern Allison. Their modern sense of humor goes down way easier than Bullock and Tatum retreading 1998's miserable ""Six Days Seven Nights"" with whiny Anne Heche and Harrison Ford. Alan (Channing Tatum) and Loretta (Sandra Bullock) try to escape from an island in ""The Lost City. Tatum, who's most charming when it seems like he's improvising, has the duo's best line when he calls pro-women Loretta ""Gloria Seinfeld."" Bullock begins as petulant and then turns emotional, a familiar character arc that she knows as well as her Social Security number. But it's Radcliffe's part that exemplifies the many weaknesses of ""Lost City."" At no fault of the actor's, his Abigail isn't realistically evil enough or outlandish enough (a la Will Ferrell's Mugatu in ""Zoolander"") to latch onto  just as the film itself uncomfortably blends action and comedy into beige mush.

It doesn't make it worth seeing, but it keeps the experience outside the realm of pain. Yet in one way the casting actually hurts: When actors who are really, really good at comedy apply themselves to dialogue that is really, really weak, you feel the strain. You feel the outline of the joke that wasn't there  and the vicarious embarrassment of a failed acrobatic turn that goes splat. String enough splat moments together, and you have a movie that could have been good, but isn't. The setup is fine. Bullock is Loretta, a romance novelist who has become reclusive since her husband's death. On a tour for her latest book, one she doesn't even like, she is paired with Alan (Tatum), a model who has appeared on the cover of all the books in her celebrated series. At this point, the Fabio-like model has more fans than Loretta, and Tatum is funny, tossing his (wigged) long blond hair and preening for his fans. One gets the sense that if the story just found a way to stay there, on that tour, the movie would have found its way to something enjoyable. But then the plot kicks in. A spoiled and somewhat demented young scion of the Fairfax media empire (Daniel Radcliffe)  these days, every evil character is a fictional rendition of someone from the Murdoch family  approaches Loretta with a proposition. Because of her knowledge of ancient languages, he wants her help finding the buried treasure of some lost civilization. That's a reasonable offer. He needs help translating clues to the treasure, and he's willing to pay her anything she asks. But she says no, so he kidnaps her and brings her to the island anyway. It would be missing the point of a movie like this to quibble too much about illogical turns of plot. But even in a goofy confection like ""The Lost City,"" it's hard not to notice when characters consistently behave against their own best interests, seemingly to help the screenwriters perpetuate the story. Over and over  I'd describe this in detail, but it wouldn't be worth reading  the characters are shoehorned into actions that don't make sense and that undercut both the story and the comedy. Daniel Radcliffe (standing) plays a spoiled young heir looking for a lost treasure in ""The Lost City,"" with Sandra Bullock (right) as the writer and ancient-languages expert he kidnaps to help him find it and Channing Tatum as her cover model. The movie has two bright spots. Brad Pitt makes a brief appearance as the man who can get them off the island. Bullock asks him how he happened to become so handsome and he answers, ""My father was a weatherman."""
319,XNT_Doc9_Lost_city,XNT_Doc9_Lost_city,XNT,Comedy,Negative,Lost_city,"The Lost City Review: Romancing the Cliche. The Lost City is proof that star power and chemistry can only take a film with a mediocre script so far. With the success of the two recent Jumanji films, and to a lesser degree Jungle Cruise, it was starting to look like the only way to get a big-budget, jungle-set adventure film made was by attaching it to a recognizable IP and casting Dwayne Johnson. Compared to those films, there's something distinctly old school about Adam and Aaron Nee's The Lost City, a breezy lark whose charm rests solely on the shoulders of its star performers rather than any direct, nostalgic connection to an earlier film or amusement park ride. And yet, it's hard not to notice just how liberally The Lost City lifts elements of both plot and character from Robert Zemeckis's Romancing the Stone. That 1984 film, starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, also follows the adventures of a lonely romance novelist who travels to a remote jungle after being swept up in a kidnapping and then meets up with a dashing hero who helps her to evade a wealthy baddie and search for a long-hidden treasure. When the suave ex-Navy SEAL played by Brad Pitt unceremoniously exits The Lost City, that's when the film begins to find its own voice, foregrounding the unlikely romance between reclusive novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) and her hunky, much-beloved cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), who's long been a nuisance to the writer on her many book tours. Unfortunately, though, the film's brisk and clever opening act is the only time that the material strikes an especially memorable balance between action and humor. Indeed, The Lost City's manic hilarity reaches its peak in early scenes where Alan dances wildly on stage before his female fans and Tatum gleefully plays up his character's Fabio-esque qualities. And the film's most thrilling and funny action sees Pitt's Jack Trainer dispatching an evil billionaire's (Daniel Radcliffe) lackeys on the tropical island where much of the film takes place, deliberately undermining Alan's masculinity every step of the way. During this stretch of the film, Tatum and Pitt lean into the excesses of their characters, mining surprising humor from familiar tropes. Radcliffe, too, is quite amusing as the spoiled and eccentric Fairfax, who enlists Loretta to help him find an ancient treasure called the Crown of Fire and has three giant tables full of cheese prepared for her arrival in a misguided attempt to make her feel more comfortable when she's eventually abducted. After Loretta is freed and she and Alan run around the island trying to find a way off of it, The Lost City sheds these more eccentric flourishes in favor of blander rom-com trappings. Bullock and Tatum have enough charisma to keep things lively enough during this final hour. But as it becomes increasingly obvious to Loretta that Alan has more depth to him than his Adonis body led her to believe, the film only solidifies his"

I have a confession to make: I have never warmed up to Sandra Bullock as a star. It isn't that I haven't enjoyed her presence onscreen. It's just that on her own, she doesn't feel like a supernova; she dims or brightens by virtue of whom she is acting against. When it's Keanu Reeves? That's when she truly shines, in movies like 1994's Speed, where her determination and wit perfectly flirt with Reeves's doting machismo. (I even have a soft spot for their dynamic in the admittedly weird 2006 romantic drama, The Lake House.) She has the appropriate charm in Miss Congeniality, a 2000 film that again highlights her prickly steadfastness while giving her physical comedy alongside seasoned scene partners like Michael Caine and Candice Bergen. In 2013's Gravity, her drive is so well-harnessed that the chemistry she cultivates with George Clooney persists long after he disappears. But as an unyielding matriarch in The Blind Side, a 2009 film built on baldly uncomfortable racial politics that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar, she fails to feel whole or engaging. As the supposed center of the film, she lacks any force beyond curdling white saviorism. The Lost City, released this weekend, is the kind of film meant to rest on the laurels of star power. Not just Bullock's, but her immediate cast members', too. The film  which scans as Romancing the Stone cosplay updated for the current moment  is the kind of romantic action-adventure caper we haven't seen in decades. It doesn't waste time. At a fleet 92 minutes, the film dives into a story about Loretta Sage (Bullock), a highly successful romance novelist whose life has been defined by loneliness since the death of her beloved husband. Her apparent knowledge of a lost city  reflected in her swooning recent book  gets her kidnapped by a madcap, disgruntled billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) who believes she can locate the priceless treasure he's been spending oodles of cash to find. Loretta proves to be more capable than her captors realize, and she's not alone  the sweet himbo who models on her covers, Alan (Channing Tatum), sets out to save her, leading to high jinks and, theoretically at least, romantic sparks set against the backdrop of a dangerous jungle on a forgotten island. ""The movie comes with an additional set of stakes specific to Hollywood's post-pandemic future,"" the New York Times' Kyle Buchanan posits. ""As the theatrical business constricts, will people still go see an old-fashioned comic adventure where the actors lack any superpowers besides A-list charisma?"" Here's the problem. The Lost City may have the A-listers, but it doesn't possess the craft necessary to spotlight their skills. Audiences shouldn't be blamed if they are cold to the film. How can we expect people to respond to adult movies like this if they lack the charm of the genres they're plundering for inspiration? The Lost City isn't terrible, just aggressively"
321,KUR_Doc1_Lamb,KUR_Doc1_Lamb,KUR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"Lamb is not a prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs but is an equally shocking viewing experience. One that audiences certainly won't remain silent on as the exit the cinema. A childless couple in rural Iceland make an alarming discovery one day in their sheep barn. They soon face the consequences of defying the will of nature, in this dark and atmospheric folktale, the striking debut feature from director Valdimar Johannsson. Yes, this is the movie where a couple raise a part lamb  part human child. ""What the fuck is this?"" Ingvar's brother Petur exclaims upon his arrival, neatly echoing the audience by that point. Johannsson keeps his cards admiringly close to his chest for the majority of the film. For he knows that it doesn't matter how it happened, just that it happened. Where other filmmakers could have taken the easy path down the ""elevated horror"" route, Johannsson delivers something surprisingly tender and moving. Whether Ada's delivery is a miracle or an abomination, she is giving Maria and Ingvar the chance to play happy families and to work through their grief together. It is easy to admit that on paper, this is a movie that could have gone disasterously, or hilariously, wrong. Ultimately it succeeds, to the point where you don't even question the relationship, thanks to the performances of Rapace and Gunason and Ada. The movie is at times a silent movie and yet Rapace and Gunason are able to speak volumes without saying anything. A worried look when a newborn lamb takes a few seconds to stir after being born. An empty crib tucked away in the barn. It is clear that this is a house struck by tragedy. Then slowly, laughter, love and life return to the house through the appearance of Ada. It is worth noting that this film features the finest animal acting since Black Philip. The entire cast of animals, from sheep to dog to cat are all incredibly expressive and play their parts perfectly. To the point where they should have been credited as featured performers. Johannsson has a background in special effects (having worked on the likes of Prometheus and Rogue One). This skillset is put to excellent use. Combining an actor, animatronics and special effects... or maybe just a real lamb to give life to Ada. Once the initial shock wears off, it is impossible not to warm to this sweet, strange, innocent creature. However the arrival of Petur threatens to shatter the family unit with his feelings towards Ada and also Maria. The film is made of chapters, one could almost title them Birth, Life and Death, and gives the story a fairy tale feel. Albeit one that resembles a Grimm Fairy Tale... and there is always a moral to the story. For whilst Ada is seen as a blessing to the couple rather than a freak of nature, they risk the wrath of mother nature by tearing her away from her real mother. Perhaps blind to"
322,KUR_Doc2_Lamb,KUR_Doc2_Lamb,KUR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"Lamb is far from a conventional horror movie. Rather than jump-scares or excessive gore, Lamb relies on a heavy air of dread. The Icelandic film is slowly, deeply unsettling, even when its characters are doing something as mundane as eating or as joyful as dancing. You can feel it, the portent that hangs over the whole piece, that it's heading for something horrific and any moment could be potential peril. There can be no other conclusion when you've challenged the natural order. Starring Noomi Rapace and Hilmur Snaer Gudnasson, Lamb is set on an isolated farm, nestled within a valley surrounded by towering Icelandic mountain ranges. It's so beautiful it's otherworldly, especially when the fog rolls in. Director Valdimar Johannsson and cinematographer Eli Arenson capture the exteriors in expansive wide-shots, emphasising the overwhelming, untameable nature outside, no matter how much humans try to bend it to their will. Maria (Rapace) and Ingvar (Gudnasson) are two farmers who, when birthing new lamb, discover a creature they decide to raise as a child. For the first act of the film, the full view of the creature isn't revealed, we only see its head, coddled in a blanket in the bath, the cot or in their arms. But it's clearly not just another lamb, and Maria and Ingvar don't know what the audience knows from the film's first scene  that something spooked the sheep barn not long before the birth. Lamb is part folkloric horror and part domestic drama, a portrait of a couple who are unable to cope with grief, channelling their energy into something that is inconceivable. The horror is as much in the emotional turmoil as it is in anything that is explicitly on screen. There's an ever-present but unsaid sense of loss. Even as Lamb presents idyllic scenes such as making flower crowns in a field, the fact that there is an element that shouldn't be infuses every moment with a haunting tension that can't be shaken off. And Maria has disturbing dreams that isn't immediately apparent if what you're seeing is real or subconscious. Lamb has sparse dialogue and the quiet of the surrounds means every extra sound is loaded with significance, such as the their border collie's small whines. Johannsson deftly commands every element in crafting a simple story. He doesn't need to be showy or heavy-handed in evoking the primal horror at the heart of the very weird and very provocative Lamb. A shot that lingers on the cat's penetrating glare for three seconds longer than is comfortable, the subtle metallic-ness of the score and the stillness of the camera as the characters move within their space all contribute to Lamb's discombobulating effect. It may feel almost formalist, it may ask a lot, constantly challenging the audience into grappling with its fable-like story, but it's certainly not going to be like any other movie you see this year."
323,KUR_Doc3_Lamb,KUR_Doc3_Lamb,KUR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"Perhaps the all-around strangest movie to be getting a wide release this year, Lamb is a movie best entered blindly. Though, if you're at all logged on and in the sphere of Film Twitter release hype, it may have been difficult to avoid the ludicrous selling point that the film is built on when the trailer was released. Nevertheless, if you've managed to stay cold for this one, all you need to know is this: Sheepfarmers Maria (Rapace) and Ingvar (Gunason) live a seemingly peaceful, if emotionally distant, life in an idyllic Icelandic valley where they tend to the land and their animals. When one of their sheep gives birth to a notably peculiar baby lamb, Maria and Ingvar see it as an ample opportunity to mend their relationship and come together as a family. Set up as yet another in a long line of A24-released self-serious, portentous genre films, Lamb's ultimate saving grace is in its low-key absurdism. The film starts as you'd expect: long, wordless, thoughtful shots of our main couple working their farm, helping their sheep birth their lambs (effectively setting the disconcerting mood by shooting the process, up-close and in real life), eating quiet dinners together  all presented in a cold blue-gray color palette and detached aura. It seems to suggest a greater unspoken emotional turmoil between the characters that's bound to boil over; it's also exactly what you would expect from one of these ponderous, This Is About Something modern arthouse horrors. But then there's a shift. Once the titular lamb in question becomes involved, the film becomes more of a surprisingly radical subversion of the tropes of this extremely familiar structure. The image of this lamb is so profoundly preposterous, and thus in its own way so completely gripping, that it's impossible not to let out astonished laughter at it. Whether director Valdimar Johannsson (in a bold feature debut) means for it to be as funny as it is can be called into question, but it works regardless. As the characters continue to exist and operate within the confines of the dreary, esoteric movie that this appears to be, the titular lamb works to move this into a space of almost a satirical skewering of the genre. It's best summed up by Ingvar's reprobate brother, Petur (Haraldsson), who arrives at the farm unexpectedly and is thrust into the situation: ""What the fuck is this?"" Taken away from that lens of comparison, Lamb is still ridiculous but by way of being something of a modern fable, a slice of atmospheric folk horror for today's audiences. At its core, there's a genuinely affecting story about parenthood and the burden of loss. Maria and Ingvar both carry a great sadness within them, and the fact that they see a potential to heal within their unlikely adoptee lends its presence and their love for it a certain sweetness, and the story an apt mournful quality. This balance of touching sentiment and ridiculous imagery doesn't quite carry through"
324,KUR_Doc4_Lamb,KUR_Doc4_Lamb,KUR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"You know something isn't right in Lamb, the odd, unsettling, soon-to-be-your-cult-movie-of-choice straight outta Iceland, from the moment you see the look. It's a glance exchanged between a husband (Hilmir Snr Gunason) and a wife (Prometheus' Noomi Rapace). We've already watched them go about their daily routines on their remote farm, quietly tending to their flock of sheep, tilling soil, exchanging pleasantries and what seems like the coldest of comforts. A heaviness hangs over the couple; an empty child's room points towards something too tragic to speak of. One winter evening, as they're assisting a ewe with the birth of her lambs, the last of the animal's offspring attract their attention. The weak, quiet sound its making suggests it's the runt of the litter. Given the weather outside, the poor thing probably won't last the night. And that's when the look happens. Both seem confused, concerned, but somehow awakened from a slumber. There is a distinct shift in their dynamic. They wrap up the tiny creature in a blanket, take it into the house, and the wife feeds it with a bottle. Later, we see her swaddling the lamb, cradling it in her arms as she walks in circles, whispering a lullaby into its ear and lulling it to sleep. A viewer, at this point, is likely to wonder what, exactly is going on. Why are they so attached to this lamb? Why are they treating it like a baby? What's up with the sheep standing outside their door, bleating angrily at them, giving them the livestock stink-eye? Director Valdimar Johannsson is toying with us, keeping things cryptic, dropping tiny bits of information here and there, just enough to keep folks one half-step behind everything. Eventually, he lets down the curtain so we get a better picture of what's going on  at which point his debut feature somehow becomes a hundred times creepier, and a thousand times more poignant. It's a horror movie, to be sure, and one with a particularly disturbing visual at the center of it. (A hearty congratulations to the VFX team that worked on this.) No matter how many times it repeats or slightly varies, that image remains the key to what makes Lamb tick, as well as what makes it so moving. What felt like an unusual metaphor for how parenting taps into an inherent need to nurture suddenly swerves into Grimms' fairy-tale territory. It's the sweetest, most touching waking nightmare you've ever experienced. That isn't to say that the rest of the elements  the other ingredients in Lamb's stew  aren't wonderful (Rapace is particularly on point, even when the story dips headfirst into the weird, and then the even-weirder), or that they don't contribute to the exact combination of tender and disturbing Johannsson is chasing. Another person eventually joins this trio, a louche, leather-jacketed hipster (Bjorn Hlynur Haraldsson), who turns out to be the husband's brother.

325,KUR_Doc5_Lamb,KUR_Doc5_Lamb,KUR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"For long moments nothing much happens in Lamb, an Icelandic enigma that comes wrapped in sheep wool and endless Arctic light: It's just a couple on their remote rural homestead, laconically carrying out the daily work of farming and feeding and wearing well-knit sweaters. But there's a heaviness around the pair  Maria (Noomi Rapace) moves through her chores like they're a penance; Petur (Bjorn Hlynur Haraldsson) cries quietly sometimes on his tractor  and a collection of small crosses in a graveyard on the hill that speaks to some deeper, more primal kind of loss. Until the day a ewe gives birth in the barn and the couple stare at each other, astonished. Soon the little lamb is living in their home like any long-awaited newborn: swaddled, bottle-fed, adored. Director Valdimar Johannsson doesn't reveal the physical specifics of why that is for a while, or many other details at all; the amount of dialogue contained in the first 20 minutes could probably fit on a napkin, double-spaced. Instead he mostly lets the camera speak and sweep across the landscape: the crackle of a transistor radio, shafts of white midnight sun moving across an empty bedroom, the rolling grass and misty snow-patched hills that seem mystically shorn of any other living humans. The change in the house, though, is palpable: Suddenly there's ease, even real happiness, where there used to be sadness and silence. It's also clear that the lamb-child, no matter how many cute gum boots they dress it up in or how sweetly it naps in its crib, is by no means ordinary  though that hardly seems to matter until Petur's brother (Hilmir Snr Gunason) stumbles in from Reykjavik, an accidental witness to their odd new domesticity. Ingvar, who looks like he lives on cracked black leather and cigarettes, isn't the kind of guy to judge an alternative lifestyle, but he can't help but show his disbelief. Are they really trying to pretend this animal is part of the family? The arrival of someone so grounded in the outside world alters the emotional temperature almost immediately (clearly there's some history there, particularly between him and Maria), which Johannsson plays out in spare, carefully calibrated scenes. Ingvar's presence opens up the movie in other ways too, even allowing a little levity in. Still, there's something ugly humming underneath: the quiet foreboding of a gothic fairy tale whose rules do not portend an easy ending. In fact, the final scenes are a wallop; too walloping, maybe, in that they raise a lot more questions than Lamb can or wants to answer. But the movie's stark Nordic mood and obscure mystery are as coolly immersive as nearly anything on screen this year  and in the hammy world of supernatural horror, that ambiguity alone feels like a small, spooky gift."
326,KUR_Doc6_Lamb,KUR_Doc6_Lamb,KUR,Horror,Negative,Lamb,"Fear is relative. When it comes to horror as a genre, what scares some might not scare all. And between the marketing strategy and October release date for A24's latest, ""Lamb,"" it would be natural to assume that this is a horror film meant to take advantage of the spooky season. What a disappointment, then, that ""Lamb"" turns out to be a bait and switch. The film is focused on familial loss, transformative grief and the second chances found in children, and all of that can be moving in a particular way. But scares? Few of those are found here. To be fair to ""Lamb"" director and co-writer Valdimar Johannsson, he describes his latest film as ""a classical drama with genre and surrealist elements."" If A24 hadn't built an advertising campaign around a flock of sheep as malevolent, vengeful beings, perhaps expectations going into ""Lamb"" wouldn't be so high. Alas. There are glimmers in ""Lamb"" of the movie that could have been: one that leaned into folk horror, one that was more explicit in depicting how our fears seem to come to life in the night, or one that presented surrealist elements and asked us not to accept them, but challenge them. Instead, great stretches of ""Lamb"" pass by in which life is lived, but not much else happens. There's little narrative tension past brief inconveniences that the characters deal with quickly. And although Noomi Rapace (""The Girl with Dragon Tattoo,"" ""Passion""), Hilmir Snr Gunason (""Polite People"") and Bjorn Hlynur Haraldsson ground the film emotionally, they seem to exist outside of the film's attempted dread. Their performances don't quite match the environment in which the film is enveloping them, and the result is a strangely limp dissonance. Perhaps that methodology is meant to lull us into complacency, and into accepting the strangeness on screen, until the film decides that what we've come to see as normal can no longer be treated as such. But that pivot happens so quickly, and with so little payoff, that ""Lamb"" ends with frustration rather than fulfillment. The film is incredibly sparse in dialogue, and so entire scenes are constructed around the trio of actors' minute reactions to each other and to the mysterious, inexplicable Ada. Some of this is provocative (Maria's recurring nightmare of sheep watching her; Petur initially deadpan reaction to Ada), some of it is legitimately poignant (the tenderness with which Ingvar treats Ada), and most of it is shot with precise beauty by cinematographer Eli Arenson. But ""Lamb"" struggles to make clear how much sincerity or acceptance we should apply to what is happening on screen, and the result is both narrative and emotional murkiness. Is this objectively real, or subjectively real to the characters? Should our opinions on those two possibilities differ? ""Lamb"" can't decide. A major difficulty is the film's failure, until its final moments, to visualize Ada with the same depth and nuance as its human characters. By that point, it's too little, too late. And while Rapace,"

A rambling shaggy-dog story about a moth pouring forth its troubles to a podiatrist, the joke accumulates a kind of giddy anxiety in the listener as Macdonald stretches this thin premise well past the point of decorum for a late-night talk show, loading on more and more existentialist misery before, finally, getting to the hilariously anticlimactic punchline. Why is this moth telling all this to a podiatrist rather than a psychiatrist? Because the light was on. Lamb plays a bit like a feature-length version of Macdonald's gag, stretching its absurd premise as far as it can possibly go before blowing the whole thing up in a final moment of winking mischief. Valdimar Johannsson's film centers on an adorable half-human, half-lamb hybrid born on a remote Icelandic farm whose proprietors, Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snr Gunason), decide to raise the creature as if it were their own child. The baby, which they've dubbed Adathe same name, not incidentally, as their previously deceased daughteris doted on by her adoptive parents, who treat her as a kind of divine salvation from trauma. ""Ada is a gift,"" Maria at one point says, ""a new beginning."" Lamb gains much of its oddball energy from the preposterous cuteness of its central image. The titular creature, a mostly seamless combination of child actors, puppetry, real animals, and CGI, is at once adorable, amusing, and oddly unsettling, the physical embodiment of humans' tendency to anthropomorphize animals. Much of the film consists of relatively mundane depictions of rural domesticity, which are given just the slightest frisson of surrealism by the presence of a chimeric critter dressed in the cutesy wardrobe of a human toddler. In certain passages, Lamb plays as a satire on childless millennial couples' propensity to dote on their ""fur babies"" as if they were their actual offspring. Unfortunately, Lamb's novel premise only goes so far, and after a certain point, the film's quietly deadpan minutiae simply becomes tedious. This is largely due to the sameyness of Johannsson's visual style. The film opens with a portentous tracking shot of horses ensconced in a deep fog, which recalls the work of Bela Tarr (who's credited on the film as an executive producer). But after this, Johannsson settles into a mode of picturesque understatement reminiscent of fellow Icelander Grimur Hakonarson's pastoral comedy Rams. Like Hakonarson, Johannsson emphasizes the almost unearthly beauty of rural Iceland, but there's a superficiality to this approach, as if the filmmaker were trying to use his picture-postcard imagery to paper over the film's fundamental lack of ideas, drama, tension, or mystery. Lamb assembles a grab bag of themesgrief, domestic strife, sibling rivalry, parental overreach, and morebut the only one that receives more than a passing nod is the idea that Maria and Ingvar's adoption of Ada isn't really so innocent.

There are only about twenty minutes of its one-and-three-quarter-hour running time that sustain any interest, thanks to a late-breaking twist of industrial-strength cleverness. The narrative trickery that sets up the storyand the sense of a setup is palpable throughoutresults in a grossly oversimplified tale that reeks of cynicism. ""Lamb"" preens and strains to be admired even as it reduces its characters to pieces on a game board and its actors to puppets. The subject of ""Lamb"" is a fantasy that's planted with meticulous yet narrow attention to a realistic context. Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snr Gunason) are a young couple on a farm in a remote part of Iceland. They grow crops (most prominently, potatoes) and they raise a few dozen sheep, which live in a barn a short walk across sloping fields from their comfortable and casual little farmhouse. Their workdays involve driving a tractor, leading the sheep through fields, schlepping hay for the sheep to eat, preparing meals, helping sheep give birth, tagging and logging the new arrivals. But their regular routine is disturbed by the barking of their dog near the barn; the couple go in to see what's up with the sheep, and, looking surprised, note that one of the sheep has given birth without help. Taking the newborn in her arms, Maria brings it back to the farmhouse, where, wrapped in a blanket, it lives in a metal washtub. They feed it milk with a baby bottle and raise it in the house, dragging a crib from a storage area to a space next to their own bed, where the swaddled lamb will live. Despite glimpses of the grand, mountainous Icelandic locale and of activities in the house and on the farm, ""Lamb"" offers virtually no characterization, no inner life, no substance. There's nothing wrong with a mystery filmed from the outside, in which only observation of the characters elicits clues. But ""Lamb"" constructs its characters solely as clue generators; their identity is limited to their function. The gap between what the characters know (or, for that matter, who they are) and what they're shown doing is blatant and frustrating; it makes the movie resemble pages of redacted testimony on which there are more stripes of black ink than legible text. It is, for instance, only a third of the way through the film that the lamb in question is revealed to be actually a hybrid of lamb and humanher head is that of a lamb, and her right arm is a lamb's furry foreleg, but the rest of her body is humanoid.

The first time the sturdy fabric of life on the Icelandic sheep farm where the film takes place rips open, husband and wife Ingvar (Hilmir Snr Gunason) and Maria (Noomi Rapace, who's Swedish, but who lived in Iceland as a child) stare at each other in shocked silence. And then, with a tilt of an eyebrow, they incorporate this addition into their lives, still not exchanging a word. It's not until Ingvar's ne'er-do-well sibling Petur (Bjorn Hlynur Haraldsson) turns up in the second act, having been ingloriously ejected from his life in the city in what seems to be a regular occurrence, that someone dares mention out loud that something unusual is going on. He's quickly shushed, Ingvar telling him firmly that ""There's nothing for us to talk about."" If it feels like I'm playing coy about what the inciting anomaly is, that's only because the movie also plays coy with it at first.

What's come into Ingvar and Maria's lives is a compound creature with a human body and the head of a sheep, one born unceremoniously during an otherwise normal lambing season.

She's determined to raise Ada, as she's named the changeling, as her own, and Ingvar seems more than willing to go along with the arrangement. ""What the fuck is this?,"" Petur asks his brother tersely after his first encounter with Ada, and Ingvar answers, simply, ""Happiness."" Lamb isn't a horror movie.

While Blumhouse and The Conjuring Universe dominate the horror sphere, A24 has quietly carved out its own artistic niche in the subgenre. Unsettling offerings such as The Lighthouse, It Comes At Night, and Midsommar skillfully match their distinctive frights with resonant meditations on the human condition. The studio's illustrious resume and timely marketing have successfully escalated boundary-pushing scare-fests into commonplace fixtures in mainstream theaters (most of A24's highest-grossing films are in horror). A24 looks to continue their win streak with Valdimar Johannsson's writing/directorial debut Lamb. As a longtime special-effects technician (he's credited working on 2021's The Tomorrow War), Johannsson showcases the moody atmosphere and precise imagery of a skilled auteur. His film may look the part, but Lamb's plodding and thematically vacant execution leaves little to grasp onto. Even with Lamb not operating on all cylinders, Johannsson has conjured an inspiring concept to watch unwind. The writer/director works at his best when leaning into the abstract bizarreness of his premise, with the aging lamb presenting an ominous backdrop for the film's wandering pace to unravel. Johannsson's fittingly dreary imagery and steady framing further escalate the unease  setting up a promising canvas for ruminations on parenthood, humanity vs. nature, and the foreboding ways emotional detachment unravels. I would go deeper into the film's promising ideas, but merely listing them is about as far as Lamb delves into its themes. Johannsson's script mistakes laborsome dialogue exchanges and moody shots for a substantive purpose. Meandering movies are right up my alley, especially when there is a semblance of thematic identity behind them. In the case of Lamb, Johannsson crafts a precise film in terms of craft yet totally listless in its pursuit of meaningful subtext. Without meaningful textures, Lamb struggles to spin its surrealism into an engaging experience. Stars Noomi Rapace and Hilmir Snaer Gudnason do their best to imbue gravity into their roles as an emotionally distant couple diverging down different pathways. Despite the performances, Johannsson's script fails to give these characters agency. The duo maintains a somber complexion that doesn't represent much past abject misery  resting too much narrative weight on atmosphere and surrealist shock without genuine followthrough. I struggle to even find a genre distinction for the film, as its lack of scares and thoughtful insights leave Johannsson's film in an awkward no-man land. Lamb is admirable in its inventive concept and noble pretenses, but Johannsson's feature meanders through its premise without developing genuine weight. Still, I would always prefer to watch a well-intended hit-or-miss than most of the blah sludge coming out of mainstream theaters."
