101,AMR_Doc1_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc1_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Negative,The_Suicide_Squad,"Even by Marvel standards, the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies had wit and originality. So the news that James Gunn, their writer-director, would be doing the same for ""The Suicide Squad"" was encouraging. Even by DC standards, that movie's predecessor, ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), had been short on both. David Ayer had written and directed. To Ayer is human, but to James Gunn ... oh, never mind. Never mind ""The Suicide Squad"" either. The addition of Gunn, like the addition of a definite article to the title, means more of the same: a baroquely nasty, flauntingly mean two-plus hours of superhero action that is also (a much greater sin) noisily tedious. Jocose and skanky, it's the WWF of superhero movies. ""Squad"" has attitude to burn, and the smoke smells rancid rather than acrid. Anti-superhero might be more accurate than superhero. The squad consists of imprisoned bad guys who can get their sentences reduced by completing some deadly mission. To make sure that squad members don't bolt  having superpowers definitely increases bolting options  a miniature explosive has been implanted in their heads. The squad's fearsome minder (Viola Davis) watches them on video monitors in a control room, ready to flip a switch if any of them go rogue (admittedly, a relative term). It's like ""Mission: Impossible,"" only there it's the tape that self-destructs; here it's team members that can. Davis, who's stony enough to be a fifth face on Mount Rushmore, is one of three returnees from ""Suicide Squad."" Joel Kinnaman is a military officer nominally in charge of the mission. Margot Robbie is the squad's most exuberantly entertaining member, Harley Quinn. Even Harley's name is good. She's a Candyland version of over-caffeinated villainy and a lot of fun  though her vocal channeling of Fran Drescher on ""The Nanny"" gets very tired very fast. Many newcomers mean the cast is large and hard to keep track of. Is that Pete Davidson? Yes, it is. Sylvester Stallone? Him, too. Chief among the reinforcements are squad members Idris Elba, as Bloodsport, and John Cena, as Peacemaker (a hardy-har-har name if ever there was one). Elba is Elba, meaning a welcome and reliable screen presence. Cena is Cena, meaning it's a shame the filmmakers couldn't afford Dwayne Johnson. The mission involves an island nation somewhere off of South America ... and a coup (the new president seems to be auditioning to take over as Dos Equis's Most Interesting Man in the World) ... and a secret scientific installation where research involving an extraterrestrial is going on ... and it's called Project Starfish ... and the fate of the world is at stake ... and which of us is having a harder time keeping a straight face: me typing these words or you reading them? The mad scientist in charge of the project (Peter Capaldi) actually asks in horror, ""What have you people done?"" The question might better be directed at him, since he has an array of lit-up bolts sticking out"
102,AMR_Doc2_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc2_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Negative,The_Suicide_Squad,"James Gunn doubles down on his crass brand of humour in this charmless, unfunny and facile franchise redo. The Suicide Squad is, in all but name, a sequel to David Ayer's 2016 critical catastrafuck Suicide Squad. DC is desperate to wipe the slate clean  we know this because the title is preceded by the definite article, a promise to get things right the second time round. Scarcely any remnants of the first film have been retained, except Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, whose solo spin-off Birds of Prey was a welcome break from the gloomy streets of Gotham. There's also Viola Davis reprising Amanda Waller to provide villainous exposition aplenty as she recruits a new band of miscreants to do the US government's dirty work. Of course, there's a precedent for messing things up at DC. We now have two versions of 2017's Justice League: an abysmal two-hour snoozefest from Joss Whedon and a grey-washed, double-length ""director's cut"". The release of the latter has even inspired a not-in-any-way-laughable #ReleaseTheAyerCut campaign, which claims that Ayer was prevented from developing his opus by money-grubbing studio execs. Maybe they'll keep quiet now Warner Bros has supposedly given the fans exactly what they want. Attempts to canonise Zack Snyder as an auteur have been extended to The Suicide Squad's marketing campaign, with ""The horribly beautiful mind of James Gunn"" cited as the film's source. This is a knowing statement  Gunn joined the project after being fired from Disney, where he was developing the Guardians of the Galaxy series, for a number of old tweets in which he made jokes about 9/11, paedophilia, rape, and the Holocaust. While Gunn has said those ""jokes"" were borne of provocative immaturity, it's exactly the sort of humour The Suicide Squad runs on  rain is described as ""angels' splooging"", John Cena's Peacemaker is told to ""eat a field of dicks"", and so on. It's about as anti-woke as you could possibly fathom, and there's a complete disregard for what might be offensive to some viewers. One of the biggest problems with 2016's Suicide Squad was that you didn't care about any of the characters. In The Suicide Squad there's a baffling dichotomy of villains who are entirely expendable and those who seem to be indestructible. Sylvester Stallone fills in for Vin Diesel in the monosyllabic Groot role as King Shark, who is shot, eaten alive and crushed by several buildings, while others explode in a splatter of guts at the slightest touch. Gunn seems to have recycled a lot of the gags from the Guardians films with a few more F-bombs dropped in to reassure us that this is an ""adult"" movie. Gunn does try to give his characters emotive, relatable backstories, but it always feels heavy-handed. We meet Idris Elba's Bloodsport in prison where he's being told by his daughter what a bad father he's been. Daddy issues is a running theme  newcomer Daniela Melchior became Ratcatcher 2 to follow her dead father's footsteps. It's"
103,AMR_Doc3_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc3_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Negative,The_Suicide_Squad,"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad  equal parts sequel and reboot to 2016's much-reviled but ultimately profitable Suicide Squad  offers so much rapid-fire irreverence that it's sometimes hard to figure out if it's even supposed to be a movie. With its incessant profanity, ridiculous body count, and trollish sense of humor, Gunn's film often seems content to exist in a constant state of rug-pulling. Lots of fun but little forward momentum. It kills off supposedly major characters with abandon and it upends noble superhero virtues with such indulgent glee that it can feel repetitive at times. But sometimes the low-hanging fruit is also the sweetest fruit. It's hard to hate a movie in which Sylvester Stallone voices a giant talking shark who pretends to read a book so people will think he's smart. ""Book read,"" he rumbles, adorably, holding the book upside down. ""So smart, me. Enjoy book so much."" Of course, the Suicide Squad concept was always meant to upend the noble superhero virtues. This is a crack team of killers assembled from a variety of supervillains serving time in prison. They're allowed out for special, covert missions at the behest of ruthless government official Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), and they don't fight because they're trying to save the world; they fight because they're bribed and coerced, and also they have bombs implanted in their necks that Waller will detonate if they get out of line. Sometimes they fight because they get to kill. Sometimes they switch sides, because they are, after all, bad guys at heart. That's what made the Suicide Squad comics among the more interesting titles in the superhero firmament: They were often so delightfully unpredictable. It's a fun idea for a movie, too, since the best iterations of the genre tend to live or die by the strength of their villains, and this concept is villains all the way down. It actually felt well-timed back in 2016, when Marvel's colorful jokeyness had taken a turn for the self-important and DC's gritty earnestness had been supercharged by films like Batman v. Superman. Most critics despised the first crack at a Suicide Squad movie, directed by David Ayer (Fury, End of Watch). It had its moments of refreshing nastiness but had clearly been hacked to pieces in post-production. Reportedly, a company that made trailers was brought in to recut it, which is maybe why so much of the picture felt like a random assemblage from a far more interesting effort. Ayer has since all but disowned the film. It's easy to see, in retrospect, how his street-level tough-guy sensibility might not have provided the R-rated but still juvenile geekery DC and Warner Bros. were gunning for. Gunn, who delivered one of Marvel's more entertainingly trippy and colorful hits with the first Guardians of the Galaxy and who spent the early part of his career working in the Troma exploitation-flick salt mines, is clearly a better fit for this stuff than Ayer ever was. Still, despite its"
104,AMR_Doc4_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc4_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Negative,The_Suicide_Squad,"If you pay attention to movie talk on the internet, you may have noticed a common complaint about modern superhero films. They're mainly neutered, with no sense of jeopardy, violence, or sexuality. James Gunn, director of The Suicide Squad, appears to have listened to this and come up with a solution  to make a movie so crass that we'll be begging to go back to the kids' stuff. This answer, of sorts, to David Ayer's dull, disjointed Suicide Squad (2016) is an anything-but-dull explosion of hyperreal violence. Limbs are torn from bodies as a gang of freakish mercenaries including super-assassins Bloodsport (Idris Elba), The Peacemaker (John Cena), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), are forced on a mission under the auspices of a shadowy government programme. They must go to a fictional South American country on a mission to destroy a powerful weapon. But Gunn, whose previous work with the Guardians of the Galaxy series landed just this side of tongue-in-cheek, here goes off the rails entirely. The humour, for one thing, simply doesn't land. It's all try-hard postmodernism and quippy one-liners, concealing an unfunny cruelty just beneath. And the grotesquerie, an obvious attempt to tart up the DC Universe with adult material, falls even flatter. There's something strangely uncomfortable about the movie's juxtaposition of cartoonish shark-men with gleeful close-ups of decapitations that feel more at home in a mondo film. The Guardians of the Galaxy-style goofiness mixed in with lingering shots of maimed lasagne-like innards feels queasy and all wrong; it's like someone exposing themselves at a wedding. In the interest of being charitable, there are some good actors here  Elba, Robbie, and Cena chief among them. Robbie's Quinn, off the back of the punky energy of Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey, is the best thing about the movie by a country mile. The screen lights up with her red-gowned, machine-gun-toting presence, but even she cannot save this movie. In the final third, the plot nods to the evil of US intervention in South American military coups, but it's liberal lip service of the cheapest kind. The Suicide Squad is just pretending to take a position, so it can get away with things like having Harley tell a man he has a ""beautiful monster"" between his legs before killing him. Some may give The Suicide Squad credit for its inventiveness and gutsiness. In my view, the fact that this confetti-coloured stupidity is getting any credit at all reveals what a dire state contemporary superhero films are in."
105,AMR_Doc5_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc5_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Negative,The_Suicide_Squad,"The Suicide Squad plays off as just a fun movie, at least on the surface. Not so deep down, however, the film is seemingly intended to stand as criticism of U.S. imperialism. This is evidenced by the setup of the Corto Maltese storyline  with the U.S. turning a blind eye to the country's political upheaval. And by the fact that, in the end, the ""criminals"" are proved to be the good guys. If there's a villain in The Suicide Squad, it's not the men and women Amanda Waller released from prison to do her bidding. It's Amanda Waller herself, and more importantly, the U.S. government. But the movie misses a huge opportunity to ground the message it intends to send, and in doing so, dilutes the notion to the point where it loses all its power. The Suicide Squad is far from the first comic book property whose central message includes a criticism of the government its protagonists have sworn to serve. Instead, the movie chooses to rely on the same vague notions of a shady government figure without assigning any blame for actual events to the people responsible. The fact that the movie's exterior shots were filmed primarily in Panama, a country with a lot of experience on the dangers of U.S. imperialism, meant James Gunn had a chance to present the kind of social criticism that had some bite to it. Ironically, despite the movie's attempts to pretend the action is taking place in Corto Maltese  a fictional DC setting that is meant to exist off the coast of South America, just like that, no more details, as if South America only has one coast  a keen eye can spot many clues clearly placing the action in the Central American nation where I was born. The most egregious of those is an obvious sign reading ""Chicheme Chorrerano."" Unless Corto Maltese also has a place called La Chorrera famous for its chicheme, then the movie is obviously set in Panama  which is where it should have been set. With a Panama setting, The Suicide Squad could have gone from a property attempting to have its cake and eat it too, to a movie with a real message, one that packed a punch. Panama was, after all, invaded by the U.S. a little over thirty years ago. ""Operation Just Cause,"" a name so dripping in irony it almost feels fake, was presumably about ""saving the Panamanian people"" and, of course, protecting the Canal from ruthless dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. In a twist, The Suicide Squad should appreciate, however, the same man the U.S. was protecting Panama from: Noriega, a former CIA agent turned strongman. For many years, Noriega served U.S. interests in the region and was given free rein because of it. The moment he decided he wanted more control than the U.S. wanted to give him, he became an enemy that needed to be taken down ASAP. And in real life, the United States didn't"
106,AMR_Doc6_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc6_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Positive,The_Suicide_Squad,"An invigorating blast of bloody, disreputable comic-book cinema, The Suicide Squad turns its titular criminals into a collection of lovable anti-heroes set loose in a dazzling, surprisingly emotional adventure. Not exactly a sequel to 2016's Suicide Squad  more like another stab at the same milieu, featuring some of the same characters  the new picture is energised by writer-director James Gunn's unapologetically gritty approach, which feels like a bracing antidote to the earnestness and forced gravitas so prevalent in superhero films. Margot Robbie and Idris Elba shine, balancing humour and edginess in a blockbuster studded with visual wonders and inspired set pieces. The latest instalment in the DC Extended Universe arrives in the UK on July 30, hitting US screens (and HBO Max) on August 6. Will Smith, who starred in the 2016 film, isn't in The Suicide Squad, but Robbie's return as Harley Quinn ought to compensate, joined by newcomers John Cena and Peter Capaldi. The original film grossed nearly $750 million worldwide, so there is definitely demand for a follow-up, especially one that's significantly better than the first. Government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a ragtag team of hardened prisoners, dubbed The Suicide Squad, to take out Jotunheim, a former Nazi lab hidden on an island off South America which is believed to still be conducting horrific experiments. The reluctant leader of the Squad, Bloodsport (Elba), must work with, among others, the bloodthirsty Peacemaker (Cena), and they're soon joined by Harley Quinn (Robbie), the sole survivor of a separate mission to destroy Jotunheim. They apprehend the evil scientist Thinker (Capaldi), who reveals that the lab has been housing a fearsome interstellar creature, Starro, that, if unleashed, could destroy humanity. Gunn, who previously directed the Guardians Of The Galaxy pictures, takes over the reins from from David Ayer here. While both series focus on a group of underdogs who join forces to save the day, Suicide Squad's impudence previously felt strained, Gunn exudes a breezy confidence in this follow-up, delivering stronger action sequences and more glorious carnage. The Suicide Squad is far gorier and expletive-heavy than Gunn's Guardians films, and he seems liberated by not having to appeal to family audiences. Yet unlike, say, Deadpool, The Suicide Squad isn't interested in simply being irreverent. Instead, amidst the adult humour and graphic violence, the follow-up gives its tough-talking characters a rugged nobility which is endearing, even touching. Elba is superb playing a grizzled mercenary who learns to care about others, although that doesn't stop him from feuding with Peacemaker, who considers himself the superior warrior. But whether it's the matter-of-fact gruesomeness  a walking, talking shark named King Shark (Sylvester Stallone) indiscriminately eats baddies along its path  or the vivid depiction of the beautiful, terrifying Starro, which is essentially a mammoth killer starfish, The Suicide Squad is both shrewder and more down-and-dirty exciting than the typical superhero entry. It has also been fabulously conceived: Gunn's entire creative team brings a level of energy and ingenuity that dwarfs"
107,AMR_Doc7_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc7_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Positive,The_Suicide_Squad,"With the conscious addition of a ""the"" to the title of The Suicide Squad to distinguish it from the 2016 Jared Leto-fronted stinker Suicide Squad, a number of the cast return here for this loose second shot at adapting the DC superhero comic, most notably Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Robbie's fellow Australian actor, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang. Joined by a breathtaking rank of other new members  including but not limited to Idris Elba as Bloodsport and a charming voice actor performance by Sylvester Stallone as King Shark  if the ham-fisted glut of multi-million dollar special effects don't dazzle you, then the calibre of The Suicide Squad's genuinely impressive ensemble cast by all rights should. As is typical of such fare, the story is simple and yet, in its own way, still convoluted enough to drag it all out to well over the now seemingly required 2+ hour mark. But writer/director James Gunn's playful banter fuels it nicely, keeping things energised without falling into the grovelling, tacky 'fan service' trap that blockbuster franchise films of this nature so often risk doing. The eponymous team of the title find themselves effectively blackmail by the US government and Davis's tough-as-nails Waller to undertake a mission in the fictional South American country Corto Maltese where America has a political interest and finds those interest under threat from a coup that saw the previous government overthrown. Their mission is, as the film's title suggests, a risky one with little chance of survival, but as in the spirit of such films, bless their cotton socks as they give it a red hot go, all spurred along nicely by a range of interpersonal relationships, action scenes driven by big money and the mirage of near-supernatural gymnastic skills, and all leading towards the prerequisite boss level showdown, this time with a giant kaiju-like giant pink starfish. Superhero films of this scale in many ways are almost immune to everyday, run of the mill film criticism; audiences will go to this film with a preconstituted idea of whether they will like them or not, so film criticism of the consumer advice nature verges on almost redundant. That being said, it is worthwhile now and then for those of us who aren't on board the superhero film train already just to check in and see where things are going, using it as a barometer of sorts to get a feel for what audiences want from these kinds of movies (or, at least, what studios think audiences want from these kinds of movies). Even for someone with a relative disinterest  although certainly not active dislike  in superhero films, if The Suicide Squad is anything to go by, big dumb shiny fun remains the order of the day, and if that doesn't woo you, then its solid cast camping it up to the extreme make it hard to resist. What risks on the surface of being a Hollywood celebrity vanity"
108,AMR_Doc8_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc8_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Positive,The_Suicide_Squad,"Thank goodness for the brutish, maximalist, shitbag silliness of The Suicide Squad, which is a bit overstuffed, exhausting in its commitment to every single one of its too-many bits, and emotionally overconcieved  but wise enough, nevertheless, to be stupid where it counts. Because it's at its most unhinged and silly, with all pretenses to character complexity abandoned and the entire pot of spaghetti strands sticking to the wall, that this movie veers closest to really doing something. The Suicide Squad's predecessor, 2016's Suicide Squad  no The  was (for the most part) just stupid. That's plausibly because of the storied Warner Bros. interventions that enforced a late-stage post-production pivot into banal, conflicted lifelessness, resulting in a movie that had unmistakably been ""ripped to pieces,"" as director David Ayer has since put it. But I don't know. Suicide Squad didn't totally inspire confidence in the idea of some far-superior cut still hanging out on a hard drive somewhere, tragically shred to bits and pieces of sparkling brilliance that still await some visionary to assemble them into something more joyfully chaotic and narratively coherent or, even better, proudly, knowingly incoherent. Nor does Jared Leto's eyebrow-raising claim  that he shot enough material, as that film's Halloween pimp Joker, to fill an entire movie  exactly spark joy, even as it intrigues. Leto was right about one thing, though  something James Gunn's new movie honors with brain-dead bombast. ""If a film was ever going to be rated R,"" said Leto, ""it should be the one about the villains."" Duh. The 2016 Suicide Squad was rated PG-13, a red flag if ever there were one. One criticism lobbed its way, that it was ""ugly trash,"" would, in the best of cases, have been an honorific. Were it uglier, trashier, there'd be more about it worth remembering and reveling in, five years after the fact, than the one great moment of Viola Davis cutting into a steak with enough vicious relish to tempt even a stalwart vegan to traipse over to the nearest butchery once the credits rolled. Alas. What must be said in favor of James Gunn's stand-alone sequel  which is now in theaters and will be streaming on HBO Max for 31 days, per Warner Bros.' pandemic-panicked release strategy this year  is that it earns its R rating. The violence is, in a word, excessive. When a heart gets stabbed, we get an interior shot of the heart, sliced open, struggling to beat. When a body gets ripped apart by a sentient shark-god, the frame rate is dialed down just enough for the cringing details of the individual organs, now midair and in fatal disarray, to be plainly visible. In that same moment, a bolt of lightning flashes for no other reason than because comic book chaos is  should more often be  surreal. All of this befits the grime-splashed, blood-splattered grindhouse cosplay Gunn largely seems to be going for in this movie: all gore and guts"
109,AMR_Doc9_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc9_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Positive,The_Suicide_Squad,"In the slender book entitled ""Sequels That Improve Upon the Original,"" in the chapter marked ""Because They Hired Someone Who Better Understood the Tone,"" you'll find ""The Suicide Squad,"" a follow-up to 2016's ""Suicide Squad"" that doubles down on what the first movie got right while learning from its predecessor's mistakes. I noted, in my review of ""Suicide Squad,"" that the film wanted desperately to follow in the footsteps of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as a film in which a group of thrown-together mismatched misfits overcome their mutual loathing and learn how to defeat a common enemy. As such, the fact that this follow-up was written and directed by ""Guardians"" filmmaker James Gunn represents a step in the right direction. (Industry gossip in 2016 blamed the studio for watering down original director David Ayer's darker vision after a colorful and comic trailer played well with audiences.) ""The Suicide Squad"" is by no means perfect, but like the ""Deadpool"" movies, it's a showcase for what can happen when a superhero movie is allowed to be sprightly, self-aware, and sardonic while also indulging in hard-R violence, gore, and language. Gunn' latest creation is not without moments that drag, but when it pops, it pops brilliantly. Shadowy government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is back, assembling a new Task Force X to deal with the aftermath of a revolution in the island nation of Corto Maltese. Unlike the original ""Suicide Squad,"" in which Davis was saddled with the onerous task of reciting a dozen or so super-villain backstories, this movie doesn't particularly care whether or not we know who Blackguard (Pete Davidson) or TDK (Nathan Fillion) are; all that matters is that these incarcerated villains get time off of their sentences if they successfully complete a mission, and should they step out of line in any way, Waller will detonate the nano-explosive she has had implanted in the base of their necks. There are diversions and side-missions aplenty here, but the essential crew includes Bloodsport (Idris Elba), a crack shot who's only along to keep Waller from dragging his daughter (Storm Reid, ""A Wrinkle in Time"") through the penal system; Peacemaker (Jon Cena), also a crack shot, but one who's clearly bonkers in the pursuit of what he considers justice; Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), post""Birds of Prey"" and still her emancipated self; Ratcatcher II (Portugese actress Daniela Melchior), who can command rodents; King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), a dopey man-eater who splits the difference between Killer Croc in ""Suicide Squad"" and Groot in the ""Guardians"" movies; and the Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian, ""Dune""), who's got deadlier powers  and deeper mommy issues  than his innocuous name might suggest. Also along for the ride are Peter Capaldi as the villainous Thinker, Steve Agee as one of Waller's laptop lieutenants, and a big-bad monster whose identity won't be revealed here, although if you're up on your DC Comics history, the fact that Waller refers to the mission as ""Operation Starfish"" should tell you"
110,AMR_Doc10_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR_Doc10_The_Suicide_Squad,AMR,Action,Positive,The_Suicide_Squad,"James Gunn's 'The Suicide Squad' may be a splatter-fest, but it's far less haphazard, and far more picturesque, than 'Suicide Squad.' That James Gunn's The Suicide Squad outshines its predecessor is a given, since even Warner Bros. hopes to forget its incoherent Frankenstein's Monster (2016's Suicide Squad, no definite article). The new film, while technically a sequel, hits refresh on the concept  incarcerated supervillains turned into a band of government operatives  and takes a more fitting aesthetic approach. Gunn is much better suited to the material than either David Ayer or the trailer house that re-cut the previous film, though while the end result is gorier, funnier and occasionally more heartfelt, it doesn't quite coalesce into something totally fun, or totally meaningful. The film opens with a bang, zipping through a handful of character and concept introductions that viewers are either familiar with, or that don't need much explaining. The setup is simple: ruthless government suit Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) runs an off-the-books black ops group called Task Force X, recruited from a high-security prison, and nicknamed ""The Suicide Squad"" since Waller has placed tiny bombs in their necks, which she threatens to set off if they refuse to comply. The missions are incredibly dangerous, and since this is a comic book universe, the people best suited for the job are either highly effective supervillains, or highly expendable ones. The roster, this time around, is a colorful array of lonely weirdos whose powers range from childishly simple (Flula Borg's Javelin wields an Olympic javelin) to joyfully nonsensical (Nathan Fillion's ""TDK/The Detachable Kid"" can send his disembodied arms to slap you in the face). You can place sure bets on who lives or dies, though how they die is often surprising; blood and limbs rarely stay put, and not just TDK's. The violence is usually fun, and it feels like Gunn tapping into his B-movie roots, albeit with more polish and with some of the edges sanded down. However, compared to most modern Hollywood blockbusters, it's basically a splatter-fest. While a number of lively supporting players occupy the margins  including the mercenary Blackguard, played by Pete Davidson as if he'd just waltzed off the set of SNL  the film focuses on seven individuals in particular, who are sent to infiltrate a scientific facility in Corto Maltese, a fictional South American nation, after a local military coup threatens to unleash an enormous alien power. The returning regulars include DC mainstay Harley Quinn, who Margot Robbie could play in her sleep at this point, and Joel Kinnaman's straightforward army colonel Rick Flag, who's allowed slightly more of a personality this time, and a few shots at comedic timing. Joining them at the front of the pack is Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), a second-generation supervillain with a psychic link to rats, who's either a narcoleptic, or some vague, made-up stereotype of a ""lazy millennial."" (It's not quite clear, though Melchior's presence is rather sweet.) She forms an uncanny friendship with"

The sequel in question, titled It: Chapter Two ( It Chapter Tw o, 2019) is located chronologically, for that same reason in 2016 where all the children we met in the first installment set in 1989 are already adults. After a prologue that once again delves into the theme of xenophobia, homophobia and bullying, Mike is the only one who continues to live in Derry. That's why he is in charge of telling the rest of his friends who have left that Pennywise is back murdering people. It is no coincidence that it is Mike who reunites the ""Losers Club"", because because he has not left the city his memories are fresher than those of the rest and narratively speaking, he is the one who was the last to join the group as a child. friendly and conversely now he is the one who summons them to fulfill the promise with which It (2017) had ended. One of the most interesting aspects of this story is still present here, and that is that there is something rotten in Derry since its foundation, ""that"" that seems to come out of the sewers, spreading throughout the city, until it contaminates it. That which after the initial confrontation with the ""Losers Club"" will return more strengthened and terrifying than ever. And it is worth asking if ""that"" has ruined the city or if it happens there because Derry is a place where from its foundations the adults are violent, possessive or ""absent parents"", and therefore the children are totally unprotected and devoid of values. When the protagonists meet again: Mike ( Isaiah Mustafa ), Beverly (J essica Chastain ), Bill (J ames McAvoy ), Richie ( Bill Hader ), Eddie ( James Ransone ), Ben ( Jay Ryan ) and Stanley ( Andy Bean ), we will see what has been in the life of each one of them. Furthermore, in relation to what was mentioned above, the traumas that these children have suffered show their emotional consequences in adulthood. For example, Eddie's character is married to a woman with overprotective attitudes very similar to those of her mother, and Beverly is in a relationship with a man who practices gender violence just as her father did. Consequently, the cyclical is present throughout, not only from the return of Pennywise every twenty-seven years, but also from the repetition of harmful behaviors and patterns, as well as from the visual composition through the circular openings. That is why upon returning to Derry, the story proposes much of the time that each of the characters carry out their individual search to find themselves again. Through this experience, they must face the fears of the past to"

Despite having a (completely normal) fear of clowns and a general hatred of horror films that feature children, I loved the R-rated/supernatural horror meets The Goonies vibes It had. Since then, I've been equal parts looking forward to and dreading seeing the sequel. It Chapter Two picks up 27 years after its predecessor and introduces us to the grown-up version of the Losers Club. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only member of the group that has stayed in Derry. His self-appointed mission is to keep an eye on things and call his friends home when he is certain Pennywise has returned. The Losers reunite and join forces to try and defeat Pennywise for good. I am still torn whether or not I enjoyed this movie. I think it's a worthy conclusion to the first film, but it disturbed me more than any horror movie has in a long time. It wasn't your average scary movie filled with jump scares and gore. It Chapter Two had a masterful balance of building tension, making you dread what was coming, then hitting hard with a jump scare or extended terrifying scene. It left images in my head that lingered hours after watching the film. (I can never eat another fortune cookie) Once scene in particular that stuck with me was the funhouse mirror maze sequence. It's partially featured in a few of the trailers, I don't want to give anything away, but it's intense. The film also starts with a brutal controversial scene that is causing a lot of debate. Again, I won't spoil it, but it's the second chapter of the book, and its purpose is to demonstrate how the entire town of Derry is affected by Pennywise's presence. The locals are unnaturally indifferent to racism, homophobia, missing children, etc. Which leads to one of my biggest complaints about the films. Without multiple viewings or reading the book, it's easy to miss this affliction on the town of Derry and I consider it to be an important element to Pennywise's character and the development of the members of the Losers Club. Another common negative I'm hearing about the film is its runtime. It's just under three hours long, but I didn't feel the film dragged or felt long at all until the final showdown with Pennywise. Even with the almost three-hour runtime, I felt like some of the needed backstory was left out. We get hints at important character details, what's happened since the first film (especially Richie's character), but it still leaves many questions unanswered. There were a lot of great things about It Chapter Two. The casting for this film was phenomenal. It was easy to identify which child actor from the first film each adult actor was portraying. Bonus points and all the awards to whoever made the final casting decision on Richie (Finn Wolfhard/Bill Hader), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor/Jay"

The Losers Club, the most lovable group of misfits there is, has since grown up and left the sleepy town, but the evil hasn't. They are called back into action by Mike Hanlon, who remained as the town's librarian. It has returned, and it wants the Losers. This time, they have to kill It for good. Andy Muschietti's It Chapter One was a bit of a sleeper hit. It became the highest grossing horror film of all-time that no-one saw coming, because everyone hates sequels and reboots. But Muschietti had all the right ingredients to make his reboot work; a great cast and understanding that Stephen King's 'unfilmable' gigantic novel is actually about friendship, and the pain of growing up, rather than the killer clown everyone remembers the original miniseries for. Muschietti returns to the director's chair to craft a sequel that goes bigger and bolder in every sense, while digging deep into It's mythology, and the dynamic between the adult Losers. It's a mixed bag, and not everything works quite as smoothly as it did the first time. Muschietti also relies too much on CGI for scares and monsters, but in the end he regains a steady hand to bring the story to a satisfying, and a surprisingly emotional, close. As predicted, the cast is impeccable. It says a lot when James McAvoy is somehow the least charismatic onscreen presence; that's how stacked and good this cast is. McAvoy isn't bad per se, he's just left in the shadow of other equally talented actors. Especially good are Bill Hader and James Ransone as Richie and Eddie. The forever bickering friends steal the show, and every scene they are in. Hader is a revelation here, turning in one of the best performances of his career. He's laughout-loud funny, but his performance is always grounded in tragedy and selfhatred. Ransone gets possibly the flashiest role as the germaphobic Eddie. He gets to have the most fun but make no mistake, there's a lot bubbling under the surface. Eddie's insecurity, while at times played for laughs, is a tragic thing and the character's arc might just be the best of the film, along with Richie's. Jessica Chastain is great as Beverly but doesn't leave much of a mark, much like McAvoy. Both seem to be on autopilot, which still produces good performances, but forgettable ones. Jay Ryan, a relatively unknown Australian actor, makes a great Ben Hanscom, especially when he's pining for Beverly. But unfortunately the character is often just a root for fat jokes. Partly this is due to the source material, but considering it's 2019, one would hope Muschietti would have handled it with more grace and sensitivity. Muschietti certainly has a particular style of CGI he prefers,the overly fake look, and long, wonky faces. There's no effort to make It's iterations look realistic, but it's a strange choice, and one that distances the viewer from"

Pop culture's obsession with the painted jester has often seemed sinister, but back in 2016, something changed. A new craze had swept the world, with countless sightings of people dressed up as killer clowns, sometimes brandishing weapons and threatening passers-by. In California, one woman reported that a clown tried to snatch her baby daughter from her arms, while another man in Texas shared CCTV footage of a red-nosed prankster breaking into his home at night. They were crazy, unreal times. Enter It  the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King's classic 1986 novel. Largely indebted to the iconic '90s TV two-parter, It was a box office smash, traumatising a new generation of horror fans while raking in more money than ever before. The inevitable sequel was soon confirmed, It Chapter Two. But with two years to get over the fad and new movie Joker stealing all the headlines, has Pennywise let rip that throaty cackle for the last time? Set 27 years after the events of It, It Chapter Two finds the gang getting on with their lives. Most notably, Bill writes bestselling novels and funnyman Richie is now a famous comedian. The Losers' Club may have outgrown its moniker, but each character is haunted by their past. Eddie's new wife resembles his overbearing mother, Beverly's husband is a copy of her abusive father and now-hunky Ben can't escape his formative years as a chubby target for bullies. Eventually, a devastating phone call threatens to pull them back to Derry where Pennywise awaits. Played by Bill Skarsgard, the clown prince of mime is on top form here. Stuffed with deliciously creepy scenes, the film's mid-section follows each character as they revisit their most terrifying encounters with Pennywise. By the time we reach the epic climax, we've met baby-faced crab-wasps, mouldy decapitated heads which sing in a fish tank and a dead friend's noggin suspended by huge, furry spider's legs. Director Andres Muschietti has been given full license to spook in this sequel  and It Chapter Two works best in its weirdest, most off-the-wall moments. Elsewhere, it's a smorgasbord of genres, packing in nods to history's greatest slasher, psychological, gross-out and zombie horrors. Love The Shining? You'll want to pay attention. There's even a hilarious Stephen King cameo, where the world's scariest writer plays a sassy antiques dealer in a Neil Young t-shirt. It's a horror nut's dream. Cast-wise, the film's famous stars don't always live up to their reputations. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are fine individually, but Bill and Beverly share little chemistry. At the same time, Isaiah Mustafa is unconvincing as Mike and James Ransome's quirky take on hypochondriac Eddie sometimes feels like an impression. Fortunately, none of this matters because Bill Hader is a revelation. Funny, compelling and often moving, the Superbad star steals every scene he's in  which is most of them. When Hader's on screen, the movie zips along with a levity that's missing in the drawn-out opening."

Now, usually that's not a sentence I would write to associate with a horror film, but it's surprisingly accurate in summing up the adventure that director Andy Muschietti takes us on. Whether its Ari Aster's Hereditary or Jordan Peele's Get Out and Us, there's no denying there has been a notable shift within the horror genre, focussing more on the emotional substance and its social and psychological effects than the traditional jump scare motifs. To a certain extent, Muschietti's take on the Stephen King classic (with all of its richness and minus that controversial sex scene) has done well to align itself in that same company. Given how traumatic Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) can be with his deceptive smiles and evil manifestations, this is a therapeutic journey to conquer fears and defeat the clown. And trust me, as someone who hates that clown ever since Tim Curry donned the suit and make-up in the TV miniseries, its thematic exploration felt necessary. And that's where we find ourselves, 27 years later with the Losers Club reforming to keep their 'blood oath' promise they made as kids. The entire film is built like an epic blockbuster event that chucks in the kitchen sink equivalence of twists and turns. But like a lot of Stephen King adaptations, its subject matter can be 'out there', but beyond the surface layer of scares which It adopts, elevating from the creepy to the horrifyingly graphic (and the occasional Meta references thrown in as a tribute), its focussed exploration is that childhood loss of innocence. The coming of age vibes is strong as the plot transcends into adulthood with all of its negotiated difficulties and life struggles. But it's genuinely surprising how poignant and reflective It Chapter Two is. Working best as a back-to-back experience (which I recommend), that wave of unexpected emotion lifts the film. Drawing active parallels with Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House with its visual transitions, its switch between the grown-up adults and their young counterparts is instantaneous. It leaves a celebrated nostalgia on the journey they've faced and their growing companionship as friends which you want to revisit. But, you adore the set-up with their older selves, knowing they have to confront and reconcile with the generational trauma of their past. It's an emotional beat often taken for granted, but as much it takes its time to establish those points, you relish their reconnecting journey, proving once again that they are the heart and soul of this film. Rightfully, the film deserves high praise with its casting. Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, Andy Bean and James Ransone comfortably match their young counterparts with ease, diminishing any hints of star power, but allows room for depth in their spot-on performances. McAvoy mimics Bill's panic stutter that gets worse as the film escalates. Chastain brings the confidence that Sophia Lillis had in the first film, but is always within touching distance"

As I explained in Slate back in 2017 on the occasion of the release of It: Chapter One, It holds a particularly cherished position in my heartI've reread Stephen King's magnum opus so many times since I first read it in middle school that I've literally lost countso there was never any question that such absences were going to stand out to me. But watching It: Chapter Two, a visually inventive and at times extremely scary film that, at nearly three hours long, could have stood to omit considerably more, I couldn't help but feel like many of director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman's choices in adaptation were much worse than necessary sacrifices. They felt like grave misunderstandings, if not willful betrayals, of some of the richest parts of their source material. Like most 1,000-page, decades-spanning novels about clowns who kill children, It has long been thought to be an unfilmable work. It: Chapter One acquitted itself surprisingly well in this regard, although it did so by sailing the ol' paper boat down the road, so to speak. In adapting King's novel to the screen, Muschietti and Dauberman made two major changes to the original material. The first was disentangling the novel's two parallel timelinesone about the protagonists' childhood and the other about their adulthoodto make them two discrete entities presented in chronological order. (In King's novel these two sections are interwoven with one another.) The second was changing the eras in which these two sections are set. In the novel, the childhood sections take place in 1957 and '58, and the adulthood sections in 1984 and '85; in the movie, the childhood section takes place in 1988 and '89, and the adulthood section in 2016. It: Chapter One thus offered audiences the surprisingly enjoyable experience of watching an R-rated horror film starring a remarkably charismatic cast of foulmouthed adolescents, while collaterally benefiting from the rush on 1980s nostalgia prompted by the runaway success of Netflix's Stranger Things, a show that owed no small debt to King's body of work. In choosing this more linear structure, though, the filmmakers also opted to backload many of the novel's most complex and compelling aspects onto the second movie, setting themselves up for a landing more difficult to execute than the Ritual of Chud. That It: Chapter Two struggles to completely stick that landing is no fatal failure, and in many ways confirms what those of us who love this novel have suspected all along: that It is, indeed, an unfilmable book. But what is particularly discouraging is the manner in which Chapter Two misses its marks, as the filmmakers' choices too often seem to come at the expense of the moral world of the source material.

Yes, the scars of childhood inform who we become, and no matter how far we run from them, they continue to affect us until we face them head on. Now can we arrive there a little more quickly, please? ""It Chapter Two"" unfolds 27 years after the actions of the first film, and the Loser's Club is all grown up and has left Derry, Maine far in the rearview. Most are doing pretty well for themselves  Richie (Bill Hader) is now a successful stand-up comic, Bill (James McAvoy) is a Hollywood screenwriter, and Beverly has grown into, well, Jessica Chastain  but they're uniformly sick to their stomachs when they get a phone call from their old pal Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) telling them they need to return to Derry. Mike is the only one who has stayed behind in his hometown, and he has spent his days studying the patterns of Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who is back to killing again after nearly 30 years spent dwelling in the sewers. Reluctantly, the gang returns, each member having buried their childhoods and memories of Pennywise in the deep recesses of their memory. (And judging by their lack of familiarity with one another, none of them bothered friending each other on Facebook over the years, either.) In his research, Mike discovered the way to beat Pennywise involves an ancient ritual, requiring each of the Losers to collect a meaningful artifact from their childhood to offer up as a sacrifice to the demon clown. Which means revisiting ugly childhood memories in Derry, where adult figures are grotesque manifestations of Americana at its worst. ""It Chapter Two,"" like its predecessor, lights up when the evil Pennywise is on screen, and Skarsgard's twisted performance  especially the way he lets drool spill over his bottom lip as he stares through his soon-to-be victims and taunts them in his playfully evil clown voice  highlights the film. He's ""It's"" reason for being, the same way Freddy Krueger was the star attraction of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. (""It"" references ""Elm Street"" with several visual homages.) But unlike Freddy, Pennywise is protected; Muschietti keeps him off screen and hidden in the shadows, using him only when needed. It's the film's gift as well as its curse: Pennywise makes his time on screen count, his every laugh more sinister than the one that came before it, and he always leaves you wanting more.

Another man, apparently his friend, scolds him as he collects the prize instead of the girl, and he quickly hands it over to her. She beams. The man then kisses the other man, a moment that's meant to be a coy reversal: These aren't boisterous small-town jerks; they're lovers. Then, suddenly, the movie cuts to a few local teenagers who see the kiss. The teenagers taunt the men. The lovers taunt them back and walk away. But as the lovers try to leave the fair, the teens catch up to them, then mercilessly attack them. One of the victims is asthmatic and can't breathe. The teens shove away his inhaler, pick him up, and throw him over a railing into a shallow creek below. Screaming for help, his boyfriend runs down to the side of the creek, only to find Pennywise, the murderous shape-shifting clown, holding up the man's battered body. Pennywise smiles and then begins eating him. Fans of Stephen King's novel It will recognize the slain man as Adrian Mellon, who suffers roughly the same fate in the book. (He's played in the movie by wunderkind Quebecois filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan, well known to gay cinephiles and critics.) People from Maine, especially Bangor, King's hometown, may recognize him instead as Charlie Howard, a 23-year-old asthmatic gay man who was beaten by three teenage boys in the town in the summer of 1984, before he was thrown off a bridge into a stream 15 feet below and drowned. One of the teens later told the police they just wanted to beat up a ""faggot."" They were charged as juveniles and released from prison by the time they were 21. The case did not earn the level of national attention of, say, the murder of Matthew Shepard more than a decade later, but it left an enduring scar on Bangor, and it affected King. He included a barely veiled version of the case in It two years later. It features many horrors, some supernatural and some all too grounded in the real world. The first movie opened with a 6-year-old boy's arm being bitten off in the clown's jaws. This new one features brutal domestic violence and an attempted rape in the first 30 minutes. The various human evils that fuel and are fueled by Pennywise are essential to the story, and often, the brutality makes sense.

A few extraordinary exceptions aside, adaptations of King's work tend to range from acceptable to disastrous. Some draw on weaker material. (There's likely a ceiling on how good any film version of Thinner could be.) Others fail to explore the underlying themes of King's books in favor of scares  like either version of Pet Sematary  or get so lost in the wispier aspects of King's writing that the creators forget the appeal of a good scare or an unsettling moment. (Think back to Hearts in Atlantis, if any memory of it remains.) So when a pretty good film like 2017's It comes along, it tends to look better just by comparison. Adapting the first half of King's ambitious 1986 novel  in which a group of Derry, Maine-based kids battle an evil entity that mostly takes the form of a clown named Pennywise  director Andy Muschietti led a talented group of child actors through a largely faithful adaptation that effectively mixed scares and sentiment. Part one of It featured a few standout setpieces, and while none topped the film-opening sewer grate encounter between a little boy and Pennywise (played with shifty malevolence by Bill Skarsgard), the winning cast worked together beautifully. The film ended on an unresolved note that set the stage for a second chapter. The second half could have been even better, as it brought in an adult cast to address the first installment's still-lingering horrors. It Chapter Two isn't that even-better film, though. It's an appreciably less-engaging film in every way, suffering from lurching storytelling, wild vacillations in tone (even within scenes), and a strong cast that never fully gels as a group. Worst of all, it substitutes excess for suspense in a long middle section that finds one character after another having interchangeable encounters with Pennywise in which the self-proclaimed ""eater of worlds"" never appears to be a real threat. Sure, he munches on a few minor characters, but the main cast appears to be off-limits. At worst, he seems like an eater of child actors and other characters who are much lower on the call sheet than the leads. The film opens with a flashback featuring the cast of the original film (most of them noticeably de-aged via digital effects), the first of many such moments.

Optimism, maybe, but no guarantees. Director Andy Muschetti and his screenwriters decided to split King's New York Times best-selling, 1986 horror novel into two parts that would be released two years apart. That was a wise choice for source material that busts the 1,100-page mark and defies easy visualization, as if William S. Burroughs had written ""Naked Lunch"" as a coming-of-age story for baby boomers (now updated to Gen-Xers). Yes, it's essentially a tale about a group of marginalized adolescents who band together to defeat their fears and bullies  here literally depicted as a teeth-baring, child-killing clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard, in another effective but one-note performance). But it's also a story about memory and aging, and how we often selectively construct our identities, both individual and collective, based on what we're willing to accept about past traumas. There's a running joke in ""It"" that concerns lead character/author stand-in Bill Denbrough not being able to write good endings to his stories. The same could be said of the film, but it's less a failing of the source material and more of the filmmakers' ability to balance the head-snapping twists and turns of this wild, ultimately hollow ride. ""It Chapter Two"" opens where 2017's ""It"" left off. The Losers' Club, as the seven misfits dubbed themselves, apparently defeated the monster they called It in the sewers under Derry, Maine. They make a pact to return if It ever comes back to torture and kill the town's children, but only Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) stays in Derry to obsess over the details. The other six kids grow up and fling themselves far and wide, in turn forgetting the events of their childhood through a kind of viral amnesia that afflicts anyone who leaves town. When the killings start again 27 years later (the length of the cycle between It's feeding frenzies), it's up to Hanlon to reunite the crew one last time, or else they and the town's kids face imminent, nightmarish deaths. Script-wise, there are tweaks made to the source material to add urgency and motivation to the unwieldy plot, and to connect the themes of forgetting past evils to contemporary, resurgent homophobia and racism. But in practice, this is a funhouse ride of gory jump-scares and ill-timed jokes that lacks the heart or brains of its predecessor. The 2017 installment mostly concerned itself with the child versions of the Losers' Club, but here we see them as grown-ups, with so-so casting that largely pays off the affecting performances in the first half.

And wunza Chinese guy, and wunza black guy. And wunza martial arts expert and wunza wisecracking showboat. Neither wunza original casting idea, but together, they make an entertaining team. The movie teams up Jackie Chan, king of lighthearted action comedy, and Chris Tucker, who crosses Eddie Murphy with Chris Rock and comes up with a guy who, if you saw him a block away, you'd immediately start wondering how he was going to con you. There are comic possibilities even in their personal patterns. Chan is not known for his effortless command of English, and Tucker is a motormouth. Chan's persona is modest and self-effacing, and Tucker plays a shameless self-promoter. The story: During the last days of Hong Kong's status as a British colony, supercop Chan busts up a smuggling ring, but the masterminds escape to the United States. There they kidnap the daughter of the Chinese consul, who tells the FBI he wants Chan, a family friend, flown in to help with the investigation. The feds want nothing to do with a cop from overseas, and they also don't want the LAPD involved. So they get the idea of pairing up the Chinese guy and the L.A. cop so they can keep each other out of the way. At L.A. police headquarters, this idea is well-received after the chief (the redoubtable Philip Baker Hall) realizes it's a way to get his most troublesome detective out of his hair. That would be Carter, played by Chris Tucker as the kind of loose cannon who roars around the streets in a vintage Corvette and works undercover in dangerous situations. Neither cop likes teamwork. Both work best alone. But Chan doesn't know his way around L.A., and Tucker needs to earn points with his chief. That's enough to fuel the lightweight screenplay by Jim Kouf and Ross Lamanna, which contains a lot of genuinely funny lines and even a reference to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, of ""Jackie Brown"" fame. Chan is, of course, noted for his stunts, which he performs himself, without doubles. ""Rush Hour"" has a neat little example of his wall-climbing ability and a breathtaking sequence in which he leaps from a double-decker bus to an overhead traffic sign to a truck. And there's a scene in a high atrium where he falls from a beam and slides to safety down a silk streamer. (It's useful to point out, I suppose, that although Chan does his own stunts, they are indeed stunts and not death-defying risks; he does what a stunt man would do, but with the same safeguards and deceptive camera angles. He is brave, agile and inventive, but not foolish.) I like the way the plot handles Soo Yung (Julia Hsu), the consul's young daughter.

Cast as an odd couple of cops who join forces to find a Chinese consul's kidnapped daughter, the two leads should be laughing all the way to the bank when the grosses start rolling in. Foreign release likely will generate even more impressive coin, and homevid income will just sweeten the pot. Pic represents a savvy career move for Chan, whose previous American-made vehicles  ""The Big Brawl"" (1980) and ""The Protector"" (1985)  were B.O. underachievers. This time out, the Asian superstar gets a chance to broaden his appeal beyond his loyal cult following simply by doing what he does best. The big difference is that he does a bit less of it here  and not just because he shares the screen with a co-star whose own fans must be accommodated. Much like Hong Kong expatriate John Woo, who toned down his trademark flamboyance while directing his debut American feature, ""Hard Target,"" Chan has restrained himself in the hope of attracting the uninitiated while keeping his longtime admirers. To be sure, some Chan purists may be disappointed. In ""Rush Hour,"" the fight scenes are shorter and slightly less plentiful, and the death-defying stunts  which, as usual, Chan performs without using a double  are kept to a minimum. But even a restrained Jackie Chan is more exhilarating and engaging than just about any other action star in the business. Tucker also brings it down a few notches, and comes across as much looser and funnier than he did in last year's ""Money Talks""  which, like current pic, was directed by Brett Ratner. Tucker's manic, motor-mouth style of comedy is an effective counterbalance to Chan's rapid-fire acrobatics, which owe as much to Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton as to Bruce Lee. Whether their characters are bickering or bonding, the two stars bring out the best in each other. Early scenes introduce Chan as Detective Inspector Lee, a Hong Kong supercop who captures a notorious mobster's cache of stolen artwork just before the 1997 transfer of the former British colony. Scene then shifts to L.A., where Tucker makes his predictably explosive entrance as Detective James Carter, a fast-talking, rule-breaking maverick who prefers to work without a partner. Carter yearns to join the FBI, and thinks he's gotten a big break when his disapproving chief (Philip Baker Hall) assigns him to the bureau for a major case. But the feds simply want Carter to ""baby-sit"" Lee, who has flown to L.A. to help his old friend the Chinese consul (Tzi Ma) recover his abducted 11 -year-old daughter (Julia Hsu).

This New Line Cinema presentation is also good-looking, well-paced and makes fine use of Los Angeles locales, no small accomplishment given their familiarity. When the little daughter (Julia Hsu) of China's consul-general (Tzi Ma) for Los Angeles is kidnapped and held for ransom for $50 million, the consul appeals for help from ace Hong Kong policeman Lee (Chan), who was also his daughter's beloved martial arts instructor. The two lead FBI agents (Rex Linn, Mark Rolston) assigned to the case are xenophobic, territorial snobs who think Lee could be of no possible help to their investigation. They want Lee out of the way so badly that they get the LAPD chief (Philip Baker Hall) to assign a cop to do just that--in effect, becoming Lee's baby sitter. The chief has no trouble making a selection: In picking Carter (Tucker), the loosest of loose cannons, he'll get the wild and crazy guy out of his hair for the duration of the case. Lee and Carter come from such different cultures--a source of broad humor in the film--that it takes them awhile to get into sync, but when they do you know very well they'll leave the FBI at the gate when it comes to going after the kidnappers. Ratner keeps the picture barreling ahead while showing off his stars to advantage. Chan humorously underplays to the hyper Tucker, leaving his fabled martial artistry to provide the razzle-dazzle, while Tucker allows us to see that Carter, for all his frenetic antics, is smarter and more focused than he initially appears. Though ""Rush Hour"" is emphatically a genre piece, it still gives its stars a chance to break out into a couple of comic riffs; another one or two such interludes would not have been unwelcome. There's a funny moment when Carter and Lee discover that both their fathers were cops and become like little boys, debating their fathers' exploits, culminating with each declaring, ""My dad can beat up your dad!"" Even more amusing is a charming song-and-dance sequence set in Chinatown in which the stars meld their karate and hip-hop moves to the tune of the vintage Edwin Starr Motown hit ""War."" For a movie that otherwise works so well ""Rush Hour"" has an all-too-elliptical sequence set in Hong Kong on the final day of British rule. There's an elaborate formal dinner in which it would appear that the consul-general and his British counterpart (""The Full Monty's"" Tom Wilkinson) are marking not only the changeover but celebrating the retrieval of a stolen fortune in Chinese antiquities; Lee played a key role in its recovery. The treasure trove figures in the plot later on, as does Wilkinson's character. Also a key"

He had made ""Rumble in the Bronx"", ""The Legend of the Drunken Master"" and four entries in the ""Police Story"" series. A few of his films had gained traction in North America, but Chan was far from a household name. That all changed with the release of the action comedy ""Rush Hour"". The film opens with Inspector Lee (Chan) executing a raid on a shipping yard, and failing to capture Juntao, a crime lord in Hong Kong. He succeeds, though, in capturing many historical Chinese artifacts, and returns them to his boss, Consul Solon Han (Tzi Ma), as a farewell gift. Han moves with his family to Los Angeles, taking up a new post in the United States. In a well-crafted sequence on the busy streets of LA, his daughter, Soo Yung, is kidnapped on her way to her first day of school. While the FBI is handling the kidnapping, Han calls in Lee to assist the investigation. This annoys the FBI, and they pass him off to the LAPD to waste his time. Enter Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker), the wannabe hot-shot who hilariously screws up a sting operation, resulting in a massive explosion in LA. From the very first time we meet Carter, he's charismatic and obnoxious and steals every scene he's in. It's so much fun to watch Tucker in this role, and it gets even better when he's paired with Chan. Immediately when Carter meets Han he starts to belittle him. Carter shouts ""Do you speak-a any English?"" Han remains silent for the next few scenes, annoying Carter. There's a brilliant sequence in which he ditches Carter, which includes climbing up on a tour bus, hanging on a street sign, and jumping from car to car. Still, before long the two decide they want to take the case on themselves, behind the backs of the FBI. There's no question that in the genre of buddy-cop films or action-comedies, ""Rush Hour"" is now considered a masterpiece. The chemistry between Tucker and Chan is an absolute joy to watch and has even entered pop culture with a television remake and famous lines such as ""Do you understand the words coming out of my mouth?"" They seem to genuinely enjoy these characters and the interactions between them are hilarious. A scene in a pool hall run by Carter's cousin is particularly fantastic, ending with a great bar fight. Chan's ability to have detailed fight scenes both in close quarters, like jumping over and under pool tables, never ceases to amaze. But it's not just in tight spaces that he excels. In fact, many stunts are filmed in very wide shots so we can see every bit of real danger that Chan has put himself in. Carter and Lee pursue the mysterious Juntao and begin to make headway. While the plot is interesting, most of the secondary characters are less so. Carter's former partner"

Put your pedal to the metal and don't slow down, as everything you laughed at in the trailer (""The fastest hands in the East versus the biggest mouth in the West"") hilariously accelerates as this $30 million action comedy speeds along from the fall of British rule in Hong Kong to grid-locked Los Angeles, effectively playing off the cross-cultural, alter-ego mismatch of its stars. No matter that the actual LA rush hour plays a very minor role (actually just one brief scene) as the producers wanted more a title to grab you in than to define the oeuvre. Any more footage probably would have slowed down the plot mechanics anyway. Director Brett Ratner and comedian Chris Tucker re-team from last year's Money Talks and their new effort shows a definite improvement. Pacing is improved and the story line holds up better, the latter owing to the script contributed by Jim Kouf (Gang Related, the two Stakeout films) and Ross Lamanna, with uncredited assists from Antwone Fisher and Jeff Nathanson. The loud-mouthed Tucker is James Carter, a brass, ego-centric, suspension-prone LAPD detective who gets into more trouble than the current head of state and is ""rewarded"" by his sly superior, Captain Diel (Philip Baker Hall), with what Carter believes is a plum job in an FBI kidnapping case. Learning that his chore is merely that of babysitter, the pseudo street-smart bluecoat (well, its more gray designer suit encompassed in flashy sunglasses and a black Stingray) learns his oriental trust is Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan), a soft-spoken, highly skilled (in the martial arts, of course) cop, called to the United States at the behest of his old and still close friend, Chinese Consul Han (Tzi Ma). It is the envoy's 11-year-old punch-happy daughter Soo Yung (spunky Julia Hsu) that has been abducted by Chinese gangsters, the mysterious and elusive criminal mastermind Juntao and his blonde-haired henchman Sang (Ken Leung), the latter a perfectly capable cinema bad guy who gets some finely choreographed screen time opposite the leads. The Chan-Tucker match-up is broadly reminiscent of the yin-yang combination in Ridley Scott's Black Rain (1989), with a splash of the dynamic pairing of Gibson and Glover in their initial Lethal Weapon outing (and not their latest lame, tired sequel). It's one heck of a ride when these two misfits are playing off each other, which is, hallelujah, most of the film. Tucker, believing his counterpart doesn't understand English, gets a quick lesson in diplomacy from his ""chunky king kop"" (as in Keystone), while Chan gets an apt pool hall education in the gross misuse of Black American slang. Fancy footwork, dazzling hand play, ferocious gunfights, and amazing stunts (all wrapped in a PG-13 format!), should offer Rush Hour a great chance to boost a general sagging box office from last weekend. Both stars do a marvelous job of mugging for the camera (including those belonging to a busload of Japanese tourists) and the audience. As"

Pairing a dedicated Hong Kong detective (Chan) with an arrogant, roguish Los Angeles cop (Tucker), director Brett Ratner's sluggish, schizoid film sets the odd couple on the trail of kidnappers who have made off with the daughter (Julia Hsu) of a Chinese diplomat (Tzi Ma). As Detective Inspector Lee, action star extraordinaire Chan brings his usual winning smile and lethal appendages to the mix, while comedian Tucker, as LAPD misfit James Carter, reprises his manic rap shtick (displayed to much better advantage in ""Friday"" and ""Money Talks."") What exactly is this hybrid beast? Is it trying to be a martial-arts movie leavened with a touch of street-wise comedy? Or does it want to be an urban farce tarted up with a dash of Kung-Fu spice? The problem is it can't make up its mind and, unlike Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, the sharply contrasting flavors of these ingredients only leave a bad taste in the customer's mouth. It's odd-though telling-that this film is being hyped as ""the fastest hands in the East versus the biggest mouth in the West."" Where Chan and Tucker should work together and complement each other, they only end up vying for the spotlight, producing a whole that is a lot less than the sum of its parts. Where's a kvetcher to begin? Let's start with Tucker, woefully miscast as a policeman. His staccato patter, bug-eyed double-takes and slick put-downs are perfect for the hapless con men and slackers he usually plays, but as a law enforcement officer he is a joke, violating a mind-boggling array of departmental procedures and protocol (not to mention laws) with each step he takes. But suspend for a moment your disbelief in this modern-day Keystone Kop. When held up to the genial import Lee, who disarms bad guys with his toes and then apologizes for his bad manners, Carter's rapid-fire and vaguely racist rants about Asians only seem uglier than they are. And a sequence in which the homeboy tries to teach Lee how to sing along to Edwin Starr's soulful ""War,"" while Lee shows his reluctant partner how to relieve an adversary of his gun, is neither particularly funny nor illustrative, nor sufficient interaction to even justify the term ""buddy film."" Next complaint: Jim Kouf and Ross Lamanna's perfunctory and sloppy script, which relies on explosions over sense and pays so little attention to detail that the young kidnap victim Soo Yung is alternately identified as 10 and then 11 years old. Ratner, a prolific director of music videos before turning to features with the far superior ""Money Talks,"" brings little visual style and no sense of pacing to this limp, lethargic exercise, despite Chan's mighty exertions in a wonderful scene in which Lee punches and kicks an army of evil-doers while trying to prevent a 500-year-old Chinese vase from breaking. How ironic that the series of closing-credit outtakes "

Local hero George Bailey (James Stewart) suffers a crisis of faith and is shown - courtesy of Henry Travers's apprentice angel - just how dreadful his home-town would be had he never been born. Re-energised, Bailey returns to his leaky house, noisy kids and tottering savings and loan business convinced that his is a wonderful life after all. Except that it isn't, not really. True, Capra envisaged It's A Wonderful Life as a salute to small-town American values, a Norman Rockwell-esque portrait of a land getting back to basics after the second world war. But he still adds a lot of black to his palette. The key to it all is the depiction of Bailey, who starts out with ""a whole hatful"" of wishes. ""I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my shoes"", he boasts, ""and I'm gonna see the world"". Yet such dreams run contrary to those of his dad and his girl. In the event, Bailey stays put, takes over the family business and gets robbed by Lionel Barrymore's greedy banker. The whole thing is actually a profound downer. Profound, perhaps, because it shows life as an ongoing process of loading up and winding down. Thus Bailey ends up making a communal difference while his personal ambitions go begging. It's a grinding, dutiful, drab and compromised life. And Capra catches it to perfection. In Rush Hour, life comes breathless and breakneck. A shotgun wedding of East and West, this re-routes Hong Kong action icon Jackie Chan to Los Angeles and teams him up with American comic Chris Tucker (as a manic LAPD cop). The narrative sticks to the buddy-pic template: an odd-couple duo overcome their initial hostilities, marry the continental divide and knock seven kinds of shit out of a bunch of Chinese kidnappers. We also get the obligatory British villain in Tom Wilkinson's shady Hong Kong politico. Director Brett Ratner first worked with Tucker on his debut pic, Money Talks. It shows. Too much of Rush Hour is given over to Tucker's falsetto Eddie Murphy schtick, as though the makers feared his co-star's knockabout antics and mangled English delivery would put off Stateside audiences. They needn't have worried. Chan may look an unlikely action hero - the rumpled uncle to Bruce Lee's sinewy pin-up - but as a performer, he's beguiling. A brief sequence where he weaves between tour bus, truck and camper van views like a kung-fu version of Singin' In The Rain. But Chan's physical poetry is boxed inside narrow margins. Twilight is an elegiac, sometimes rheumatic detective tale, re-teaming Paul Newman with Robert Benton, who directed him in 1995's beautiful blue-collar drama Nobody's Fool. This time the mix is rather less successful, hindered by a script that trots out a roster of archetypal genre staples as Newman's gumshoe-turned-gofer tumbles in with a faded movie-star couple (Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman) before getting embroiled"
128,CKA_Doc8_Rush_Hour,CKA_Doc8_Rush_Hour,CKA,Comedy,Negative,Rush_Hour,"The best part of Rush Hour is the end credits, which, like all Jackie Chan movies, show us the outtakes of Chan when his stunts go wrong. These blooper reels, which sometimes show Chan really hurting himself, give you a greater admiration of Chan as a highly skilled human being who has to sweat and work to do this stuff (because the sweat doesn't show in the movie proper). But the outtakes this time also show Chris Tucker, Chan's onscreen partner, who has nothing especially challenging to do except remember how to say ""Chelsea Clinton."" Rush Hour  the title has no particular relevance to the plot  is New Line's rather disheartening attempt to help out Jackie Chan in America, probably the only country in the world where this international legend has been a two-hit wonder (Rumble in the Bronx and Supercop). His last few movies have opened and closed here pretty abruptly, so Chris Tucker  an unaccountably popular ""comedian"" whose previous star vehicle, Money Talks, was successful  has been brought in to revive Chan's American career, one assumes. How sad that the great Chan is presumed to need this kind of dumbed-down buddy movie. The ""plot"" is familiar from about a million bad movies. A Chinese consul's little daughter is kidnapped. Chan, a detective, is sent from China to L.A. to work on the case. But the FBI takes over and assigns Tucker, an L.A. cop, to make sure Chan doesn't get involved. This needlessly complicated premise, which doesn't make sense anyway, should have been dropped. This is a cop-buddy movie in the tradition of 48 HRS and Lethal Weapon, and no amount of variation will change that  especially since Chan and Tucker end up working together as if they were officially on the case. The comparison to 48 HRS has a strange twist here. In 48 HRS, Nick Nolte's racist cop developed a grudging admiration for Eddie Murphy's convict; here, in a neat reversal, it's Tucker who starts out racist. The gibes aren't nearly as bad here as they were in Lethal Weapon 4, but I still felt offended for Chan, who has to listen to Tucker's witless spouting off. (Tucker to Chan, outside a Chinese restaurant: ""Just like home, huh? Stay out here. Maybe you'll see someone you know."") Of course, Tucker learns to respect Chan, especially when he gets a load of Chan's moves. Those moves, by the way, would've been better served by a director who knows how to film them. Brett Ratner, who also directed Money Talks, is no Stanley Tong  a lot of the action is shot too close in and ruined by quick cutting. Jackie Chan doesn't need quick cutting  he's quick enough. Chan's physical genius manages to come through anyway, though the only bit of comic-brutal choreography that's really allowed to build, develop, and point towards a pay-off is a late sequence in which Chan fends off several thugs while trying to save a variety"
129,CKA_Doc9_Rush_Hour,CKA_Doc9_Rush_Hour,CKA,Comedy,Negative,Rush_Hour,"Considering his recent surge in American popularity, it was all-but-inevitable that Jackie Chan would eventually show up in a big-budget Hollywood action picture. (He hasn't been in one since he did the Cannonball Run films back in the early '80s.) That production is Rush Hour, a somewhat lackluster cop buddy movie that goes wrong in two big ways: (1) it fails to utilize Chan's full range of skills, relegating him to the role of a kickboxing action hero and virtually ignoring his comedic aptitude, and (2) it saddles him with a partner, played by the irritating Chris Tucker. In his Hong Kong features, Chan almost always delights (sometimes in spite of the plot) because he is given an opportunity to display his versatility. His performances aren't just about action; they're as much about comic timing as they are about stunts and death-defying feats. That's the reason why he is more often compared to Chaplin and Keaton than to Bruce Lee. Unfortunately, film maker Brett Ratner (who directed Tucker in Money Talks) doesn't seem to understand a large part of Chan's appeal. In Rush Hour, the actor is relegated to participating in various uninspired action sequences that could have just as easily been executed by Chuck Norris. Chan is rarely offered the opportunity to let his charisma shine through. 90% of the ""comedy"" is left to Tucker, who, when wound up, can be as aggravating as fingernails on a blackboard. The storyline is as silly as one might expect for a movie that doesn't want its viewers thinking too much about plot or characterization. It's designed as a framework for the action sequences, all of which are in dire need of an adrenaline injection. Chan plays Lee, a Hong Kong police inspector who has been brought to America to aid in a kidnapping investigation. Soo Yung (Julia Hsu), the daughter of the Chinese consul in the United States and one of Lee's former charges, is taken hostage by a gangster, who is demanding a $50 million ransom to return her alive. The FBI, led by the usual band of incompetents, doesn't appreciate Lee's involvement, so they recruit James Carter (Tucker), a LAPD cop, to ""babysit"" him during his time in America. Soon, Lee and Carter, who don't really get along, are trying to solve the crime on their own. If it sounds like the Lethal Weapon formula, it is, but Rush Hour isn't close to being as entertaining. Some people think Chris Tucker is funny, but I have yet to laugh at one of his out-of-control performances. He's too loud and abrasive, and he seems to think that acting weird and shouting are among the necessary attributes of a comedian. I feel the same way about Robin Williams and Jim Carrey - they're a lot more effective when they're under control. Unfortunately, in Rush Hour, Tucker is allowed to do pretty much what he wants, and he ends up interfering with Chan's few attempts at subtle humor. Tucker may be perfect"
130,CKA_Doc10_Rush_Hour,CKA_Doc10_Rush_Hour,CKA,Comedy,Negative,Rush_Hour,"Brett Ratner's ""Rush Hour"" is about as close to perfect as you can get with a Jackie Chan action picture. The film contains a great combination of comedy and action stunts, and I must admit that I became absorbed in the chemistry between the movie's biggest stars. But even then, hasn't this genre lost all touch with reality? I mean, the stunts, fighting, and chase scenes all seem to get more artificial as time goes by, and in the typical Jackie Chan movie, we see karate exercised beyond comprehension. Once you see it, you can repeat it over and over again in your mind without ever seeing it again. When Mr. Chan fights (he does do it well, but the way) in ""Rush Hour,"" the movie feels and plays like a flashback to ""Mr. Nice Guy"" or ""Timecop."" Judging from the construction of the movie, the makers knew that Jackie Chan's films were cliched as well. That's probably where Chris Tucker comes in. Here is a man sometimes so hilarious and influencing to this movie that it seems hard to believe that he at one time appeared in rubbish like ""Friday."" Teamed up with a brave man like Chan is at first glance hard to accept, but their chemistry and working relationship go together as well as Abbot and Costello's did in the 1940s. Trust me on this one: these two can make any movie together, and it would be a hit. Chan offers his own sly, sometimes obvious stunts, and Tucker brings to the genre what it has desperately needed: the comedy. Your result is this movie, the best of the recent action pictures, and probably the best once can be in this day in age. The story (what there is of it) serves the purpose of introducing the characters and putting them up against the action. The premise starts out with the kidnapping of a Chinese consul's daughter in LA after Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) breaks up a 'smuggling ring,' and the star players of it manage to get to the United States. The abduction of Soo Young, the consul's daughter, is not a very easy one, because she, like Chan, is fairly experienced in a karate field, so to speak. But they succeed. The event leads to a citywide investigation, as China sends in Lee to help the LAPD with the crime. To keep control of this Chinese man as well as himself, James Carter (Chris Tucker) is teamed up with him to help with the investigation. Actually, though, the only reason he was given the job to watch Lee is because he's a loudmouth police detective who enjoys driving around in LA's streets and keeping tabs on all of those gang members, prostitutes, etc. Giving him something to occupy his life will prevent the uproar in the streets of Los Angeles. Jackie Chan is considered to be the king of these types of action flicks, and why not? After all, he does all of his"
131,FSR_Doc1_Us,FSR_Doc1_Us,FSR,Horror,Positive,Us,"The underclass is coming to destroy us, and we will deserve it. That is the simple, overarching message of Jordan Peele's witty meta-horror film, Us. The 'us' he aligns viewers with is a middle-class American family of four, the Wilsons, and 'they' are their doppelgangers. The disenfranchised doubles have been living somewhere mysterious, cut off from the comforts of society. This other mother, father and two children appear one night in the Wilsons' driveway wearing blood-red jumpsuits and wielding large golden scissors, the better to slice up their counterparts. Class warfare has rarely broken out with such frightening panache. Despite the film's veneer of a social theme, Us is different from and less inventive than Get Out, Peele's amazing debut as writer and director. That film was a scathing critique of racial assumptions and stereotyping, cloaked in comic-horror. Us reverses the formula, and works best as a smart, intricately structured take on that genre, with a message that is plain but never deep. Peele is masterful at the horror part, though. Playfully using classic tropes of the genre while channelling primal fears, Us can make you laugh and cower at once. The film starts slowly, which allows Peele to drop clues about what's to come. Us is full of small visual touches and references meant to lure viewers back again and again to find more. In the opening scene, set in 1986, the camera zones in on a television commercial promoting Hands Across America, a real event in which people across the country joined hands to raise money for the hungry and homeless. Anyone who has seen the film's trailer will instantly spot the resemblance between the event's logo  a row of red cut-out figures, like paper dolls  and the red jumpsuited doppelgangers. Other references are more obscure. A homeless man with stringy blonde hair holds a sign that says Jeremiah 11:11. He recurs through the film, but Peele leaves it to viewers to go home and look up the Biblical reference on his sign. (It is chilling.) He is first seen as a theme park, where a small girl wanders into a funhouse hall of mirrors. A sign there reads: ""Vision Quest: Find Yourself,"" and that's exactly what she finds. Little Adelaide spots her doppelganger, and is terrified from that day on. The slight differences in the doppelgangers are more alarming than exact duplicates might have been When the film leaps to the present, Adelaide is Lupita Nyong'o, married to Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), who adds comic relief as a sometimes oblivious guy who tells bad dad jokes. Their teenage daughter, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), is always on her phone. Their younger child, Jason (Evan Alex) unaccountably wears a mask on top of his head. They are at the family beach house, conveniently near to the scene of Adelaide's childhood trauma. The action picks up when the doubles invade the house. Each of the actors has a dual role, and Peele has directed them with such nuance"
132,FSR_Doc2_Us,FSR_Doc2_Us,FSR,Horror,Positive,Us,"Like ""The Shining,"" there are a number of different ways to interpret Jordan Peele's excellent new horror movie, ""Us."" Every image seems to be a clue for what's about to happen or a stand-in for something outside the main story of a family in danger. Peele's film, which he directed, wrote and produced, will likely reward audiences on multiple viewings, each visit revealing a new secret, showing you something you missed before in a new light. ""Us"" begins back in 1986 with a young girl and her parents wandering through the Santa Cruz boardwalk at night. She separates from them to walk out on the empty beach, watching a foreboding flock of thunderclouds roll in. Her eyes find an attraction just off the main pier, and she walks into what looks like an abandoned hall of mirrors, discovering something deeply terrifyingher doppelganger. The movie shifts to the present day, with Janelle Monae on the radio as the Wilson family is heading towards their vacation home. The little girl has now grown up to be a woman, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), nervous about returning to that spot on the Santa Cruz beach. Her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), thinks her reaction is overblown, but he tries to make her feel at ease so they can take their kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) to the beach and meet up with old friends, the Tylers (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker) and their twin daughters. After one small scare and a few strange coincidences on the beach, the family returns home for a quiet night in, only to have their peace broken by a most unlikely set of trespassers lined up across their driveway: doppelgangers of their family. Part of the appeal of ""Us"" is how you interpret what all of this information and images mean. No doubt the movie will give audiences plenty to mull over long after the credits. In the film, the Jeremiah 11:11 Bible verse appears twice before pivotal moments, and there are plenty of other Biblical references to dig into, including an analogy to heaven and hell. Perhaps Jason's ""Jaws"" shirt is a reference to the rocket sweater the little boy wears in ""The Shining"" or it could be a warning about the film's oceanside dangers. In the '80s scene, when young Adelaide walks into the mysterious attraction, the sign welcoming her is that of a Native American in a headdress above the name ""Shaman Vision Quest."" When the family returns to the beach, the sign has been replaced with a more PC-friendly sign bearing a wizard advertising it as ""Merlin's Enchanted Forest,"" a bandaid solution to hiding the racist exterior and the horror inside its halls. As he did with ""Get Out,"" Peele pays significant tribute to the films that have influenced him in ""Us."" Though this time, there doesn't seem to be a consensus. As I spoke with others who saw the movie, we focused on different titles that stood out to us. For me,"
133,FSR_Doc3_Us,FSR_Doc3_Us,FSR,Horror,Positive,Us,"Jordan Peele's new movie ""Us"" is, at its heart, a remake  the best kind of remake. While bad remakes cynically retell a famous story with few or no variations, or make changes that ruin the core themes rather than enhance them, this one takes a smaller story and expands upon it. The result is a disturbing, effectively creepy horror movie that works where it most needs to, even though it doesn't quite transcend its genre in the manner of Peele's previous horror film ""Get Out."" Before there was ""Get Out,"" though  back in 1960, more than half a century before either that film or ""Us"" hit theaters  there was an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" called ""Mirror Image,"" written by series creator Rod Serling and directed by John Brahm. As Peele told ""Rolling Stone"" magazine in January, the episode possessed ""terrifying, beautiful, really elegant storytelling"" and inspired him to make this movie because ""it opens up a world. It opens up your imagination."" The premise was simple: A woman named Millicent Barnes (Vera Miles) is waiting at a bus station in upstate New York when it gradually dawns on her that she is being stalked by a doppelganger. She intuits that her double comes from a parallel dimension and needs to eliminate her so that it can take over her life. ""Us"" derives its horror from the same concept  evil doubles from another world trying to take over life in this one  but does many things that a classic ""Twilight Zone"" episode could not, including expanding the cast of characters. Main protagonist Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o), her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), her daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex) are vacationing at the California shore, where Adelaide had an unspecified traumatic incident as a child. After some ominous foreshadowing, they find themselves stalked by a family of doppelgangers dressed in red, armed with scissors and determined to brutally eliminate their counterparts. Semi-doppelganger may be a more accurate term than doppelganger, though, since these doubles aren't going to fool anyone into thinking that they're the same as the original. They possess superhuman strength, speed and agility; communicate through clicks, whistles and yelps; and, instead of hiding among normal human beings and attempting to fit into our world, make it clear to all that they're an otherworldly people with murderous intent. That is the major departure that ""Us"" takes from ""Mirror Image"" and, for that matter, most doppelganger stories: The agenda isn't subterfuge and destruction from within, but revenge for wrongs that are gradually revealed. The movie works because the doubles are treated as traditional movie monsters  Peele dubs them the Tethered, for reasons that become clear later on  and they exude a horrifying sense of viciousness and menace. Nyong'o, Duke, Joseph and Alex all give fantastic performances, showing impressive range as they flip from playing terrified normal humans to the sinister Tethered. Other Tethered characters also appear in the movie, and"

But ""Us"" is many cuts (so to speak) above the standard slasher/stalker thriller, so every time someone goes back into the house, or walks toward the danger, or dares to take the escalator down, down, down  it actually makes sense. This family isn't stupid. They're all whip-smart. But they're fiercely determined to protect one another, even if it means killing people who look exactly like they do. Talk about a Freudian Trip. Certain elements of ""Us"" carry echoes of the works of Hitchcock and Kubrick, Spielberg and John Carpenter and George Romero, among others  but the immensely talented Peele also has a voice of his own. Even as one laps up the richly textured, fantastically bizarre pleasures of ""Us,"" one is already eagerly anticipating the next work, and the next, and the next. Directed with feverish style, beautifully paced, filled with wickedly funny one-liners and sight gags, brimming with bloody good battles and featuring insanely entertaining dual performances from the principal cast (led by nomination-worthy work from Lupita Nyong'o), this is a disturbingly creepy gem. ""What are you?"" says a key character in the story. ""We're Americans,"" comes the response. I'll not say which line is spoken by the villain, and which belongs to the good guy. It's just one of the many times when ""Us"" offers sly commentary on the American Dream  and the distorted, funhouse-mirror image of that dream, which is anything but fun. (After all, the movie is called ""Us,"" as in ""us"" as a family unit, but also of course ""US"" as in ""USA."") Did I ""get"" every single plot element, every oddball visual touch, every little piece of the puzzle, even after one key character offers a helpful tutorial deep into the story? Perhaps not. OK, OK  DEFINITELY not. But isn't that the case with almost all the great horror films, from ""The Shining"" to ""Hereditary""? There's something thrilling about exiting a film and instantly wanting to see it again  not to mention anticipating having passionate discussions with others once they've seen it. After a stunningly effective prologue set at a beachfront carnival in 1986 that glues us to our seats, we land in present day, with the Wilsons driving to Santa Cruz for a family vacation. Lupita Nyong'o is Adelaide, an overprotective mom who is trying her best"
135,FSR_Doc5_Us,FSR_Doc5_Us,FSR,Horror,Positive,Us,"Expectations for Peele's follow-up were skewed accordingly. Yet any rumours that his sophomore outing, Us, is ""just"" a straight-ahead scare-fest seem exaggerated. Although it is foremost a highly entertaining and well-executed horror movie, Us is shot through with its own strain of social criticism. Here the subject is not race, but class, with the film introducing an underworld of voiceless doppelgangers armed with lethal scissors and clad in blood-red onesies that recall, all at once, prison uniforms, working class coveralls and, yes, Delirious-era Murphy. The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk circa 1986, where a father wins a prize (a baggy Thriller T-shirt, no less  here Peele lucks into his zeitgeistiness) for his young daughter. Ignored by her quarrelling parents, the child ambles into a hall of mirrors, where she meets another a girl, who appears to be her exact double. Cut to 30 years later, and the girl is now a married mother of two played by Lupita Nyong'o, back in sunny Santa Cruz for a beach holiday with her own family. In a film abounding with imagery of doubles, mirrors, rhymes and reflections, it should be no surprise that history repeats itself, with Nyong'o's young son wandering near the same carnival attraction, and baiting a clan of (almost) exact doubles of his entire family back to their beach house. From here, Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture. The archly creepy doubles  called ""the Tethered,"" after the manner in which they are existentially bound to their above-ground versions, like shadows  are a monster worthy of the Universal logo that precedes the film's opening titles. Peele exhibits a mastery of his camera, of managing suspense, and of teasing (and rewarding) the intimation of violence. He's also an exceptionally talented director of actors. Nyong'o's physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory. (Also excellent: Winston Duke as her husband, whose manner suggests a burlier on-screen surrogate for Peele himself; and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as their gaucher, more garishly wealthy friends.) Peele possesses a distinct talent for handling horror and comedy simultaneously, such that jokes landing in the midst of sustained suspense and wanton violence feel both natural and cathartic. There are multiple scenes in which pitched screams descend into fits of laughter, which feels like as fine a trademark for writer/director/producer Peele as his recurring image of a single tear dripping down a face seized by abject terror. Strangely, this sophomore effort feels like more of a proverbial ""calling card picture"" than Get Out. It's as if Peele, rattled by his own hype, is straining to show what he can do as a straight-ahead craftsman, absent all the talk of him being a generational talent with a gift for articulating the issues vexing America. The film's critique of classism  present not only in the central family's war against the Tethered, but their hostility toward Heidecker and Moss's family, with their Botox and smart-home and more souped-up holiday"
136,FSR_Doc6_Us,FSR_Doc6_Us,FSR,Horror,Negative,Us,"Well, so much for the alleged genius of director Jordan Peele. After the hype and flukey, fly-away success of Get Out ($US255 from a puny $4.5m budget) comes Us , a horror mystery thriller that starts out fine before descending into the kind of pure gobbledegook usually seen in bad sci-films of the 1950s. The basic premise involves a happy holidaying family who are visited one night by red jumpsuit-wearing dopplegangers who want to kill them with scissors. Turns out everybody is dealing with this issue, and as the sun rises the family finds itself facing a blood-soaked apocalypse. Now, to give the film its due most of it is fine, unspooling as a proficient, 1980s-style horror film, with all the requisite gore and comic asides to keep you from taking it too seriously. The cast, lead by the luminous Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave, which won her an Oscar), jump into their dual roles with crazed, pop-eyed aplomb. But the moment the mayhem stops and the waffle begins, you quickly realise that Peele wants you to take his B-grade splatterfest very seriously, indeed. The first reel of the film is full of teasers about experimental rabbits, forgotten tunnel complexes, Biblical references and Hands Across America. All very cute. Yet the clumsy attempt to explain everything about what these killer dopplegangers are up to strays deeply into straight-out bad-movie territory. It's evidence that the disease of 21st-century post-content cinema has now infected the horror genre, where stories are either full of holes or simply make no sense. Yet, pray, Peele has appeal, and the enthusiastic reaction to the riddles in the film  a big hit with a $US102m take thus far  has resulted in a wave of wild online speculation and laughably elaborate theories trying to decipher what the film means. (This also occurred to a lesser degree with Get Out.) Watching these YouTube and Twitter videos makes for a deeply amusing postscript to watching the film. People have also embraced the film's zombified dopplegangers  referred to as ""tethers""  by adopting their look and gait for a bit of online cosplay. Funny stuff. Perhaps this suggests that post-content cinema is breeding post-content audiences that are willing to not only overlook the shortfalls in modern movie storytelling but to engage with them, filling in the narrative blanks for their own amusement. And it's hard even for a hardened cynic to complain about that."
137,FSR_Doc7_Us,FSR_Doc7_Us,FSR,Horror,Negative,Us,"Watching the new film Us, Jordan Peele's hotly anticipated follow-up to his Oscar-winning smash hit Get Out, got me thinking about MagnoliaPaul Thomas Anderson's hotly anticipated follow-up to his defining second film, Boogie Nightswhich will have its 20th anniversary this year. Like Magnolia, Us arrives blessed with a bigger budget and laden with the hope that the director, in all his newfound freedom to explore and express the landscape of his mind, will deliver the next great gospel. What results from all that expectation, one founded on a still-molten legacy, is a mad riot of ideas and motifs, a messy gush of a movie. As Magnolia did two decades ago, Us does now. Only, Magnolia made engaging, legible enough art out of its abundance. Us, on the other hand, is a frustrating movie, oddly inert despite all its thrashing. It's a jumble of fascinating threads that Peele fails to weave together. It's what you might call a junk-drawer movie, a collage of bits and bobs that have cluttered Peele's brilliant mind for long enough that he thought he might try to synthesize them all into one movie. But the ball of rubber bands doesn't really speak to the bottle-opener thingy; the eyeglass screwdriver doesn't have much to do with the Ethernet cable. Each item has its own value, sure, but they don't form a whole equal to the sum of the parts. Us is about a lot of thingsor, rather, indicates toward a lot of things, without really being fully about any of them. It concerns a familymom Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), dad Gabe (Nyong'o's Black Panther co-star Winston Duke), daughter Zora (the remarkably expressive Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex)on vacation together. They drive a nice car, and the family home they're staying in, near the coast of California, is well-appointed. They seem happy, prosperous. But just beneath the surface is an unease. Adelaide is wary of the whole trip; as a child, she had a mysterious experience at a beachside amusement park, a lingering trauma that sets the early notes of dread in Us. That ominous scene, a prologue taking place in 1986, is really well staged. Peele is an inventive visual filmmaker, tilting his actors' heads and bodies at curious angles (he does this throughout, to sometimes breathtaking effect), and imbuing his pictures with a kind of saturated glare. This opening sequence, when young Adelaide (Madison Curry) goes wandering alone into the beginnings of a nightmare, suggests that Us is headed somewhere focused and gripping, a fable of innocence lost and a dark world uncorked. The movie starts with such promise. But as Peele gradually lays out the mechanics and components of Us, that early jolt dissipates. Us is, I think, among other things, a vague statement on inequity and class struggle, framed as a sort of unconscious Eloi vs. Morlocks system of oppression that breaks into terrible rebellion. That's certainly a worthy allegory to tackle in this age of economic and social atomization. But Peele"
138,FSR_Doc8_Us,FSR_Doc8_Us,FSR,Horror,Negative,Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele's debut feature ""Get Out"" was one of the most inventive horror movies in years, and so the expectations for his sophomore effort, ""Us,"" have been running sky-high. It too is a horror film with a light overlay of gallows humor, but it's a more ambitious work than ""Get Out."" Despite some extraordinary sequences, it's also a lesser work. The film opens in 1986 in an amusement park in the oceanside city of Santa Cruz, California. A young girl, Adelaide Wilson (Madeline Curry), wanders off from her parents and enters a seemingly deserted hall of mirrors where she encounters, to traumatizing effect, not only her own reflection but a doppelganger of herself. Cut to the present day, and Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is living what appears to be a comfortably middle-class suburban life with her affable husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and two spunky children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). When Gabe proposes a summer vacation stayover in Santa Cruz, she balks at the bad memories but reluctantly goes along. Soon enough, bad stuff happens, leading to the film's first true explosion of horror: One night, outside the Wilsons' summer home, a family of red robe-wearing Wilson doppelgangers, clutching razor-sharp scissors, are silently massed in the driveway ready to attack. As we soon see, the four actors are playing dual roles, themselves and their malevolent doubles. The home invasion is brutal, bloody, and unrelenting. Adelaide's double, who speaks in hoarse, spasmodic, guttural tones, is especially menacing. The murderousness continues as the Wilsons, seeking refuge in the nearby home of vacationing friends, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, are aghast to discover that they also have been invaded by doppelgangers. This is one of the few horror movies to feature an African-American family, and, especially given the racial-satirical slant of ""Get Out,"" we might expect the same slant here. However, Peele is going after bigger allegorical game. But what exactly is the allegory that Peele is pushing? In the 1986 prologue, he makes reference to the Hands Across America benefit event that was intended to raise millions for those who are hungry and homeless. The death-dealing doppelgangers in ""Us,"" who are soon proliferating everywhere, likewise hold hands. There are several references to a Bible passage in Jeremiah 11:11 with words ""I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape."" White rabbits turn up. Instead of specifically targeting racial animosities, Peele seems to be going after the doubleness of a society in which everyone has their dark side they refuse to acknowledge. Speaking recently to an audience at the South By Southwest film festival, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, he said as much: ""On the broader strokes of things, this movie is about this country. And when I decided to write this movie, I was stricken with the fact that we are in a time when we fear the other, whether it is the mysterious invader that we think is going to come and kill"
139,FSR_Doc9_Us,FSR_Doc9_Us,FSR,Horror,Negative,Us,"Get Out announced the arrival of an exciting and important new voice in American film: writer-director Jordan Peele. We already knew what a talented actor and comedic artist he was, but the originality of this trenchant social satire was something else again. What could he possibly do for an encore? Us is a chilling, if marginally more conventional, exercise in horror. It has a prologue teaser that doesn't fully pay off until the finale, and a number of clever, gruesome twists along the way. Us focuses on an African-American family and a childhood experience that haunts its loving and devoted mom (Lupita Nyong'o). Their trip to a summer house puts them perilously close to the beach at Santa Cruz, California, where Nyong'o had that encounter that hangs over her like a black cloud. How will this affect her family's attempt at enjoying a carefree vacation? Just wait... Invoking the phrase made popular in Walt Kelly's Pogo comic strip, this movie elaborates on the slogan, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" To that end, Us incorporates the most vivid ingredients of a home-invasion thriller and a larger, all-embracing nightmare. To give away more (which the trailer neatly avoids, unless you inspect it shot by shot) would be unfair. Along the way, Peele includes homages to Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and other filmmakers whose work he admires, especially in the realm of suspense. His composer, Michael Abels (who also scored Get Out), helps establish a sense of unease in the ordinarylike a visit to a sun-splashed beachand heightens the terror of bloody attacks at night. In fact, all of Peele's collaborators come through for him in a film that is made with skill and panache. But when it was over I didn't feel a sense of satisfaction. Perhaps that's because Peele packed more into his dense screenplay than was absolutely necessary. To my mind, it's self-consciously clever, and not to its benefit. The backstory, which fuels everything that follows, is full of odd choices. Admittedly, I'm not the kind of person who enjoys solving complicated puzzles, and that may be my Achilles' heel when it comes to this film. All I know is that strictly on a gut level, the movie left me wanting."

All three qualities are on display in his second effort  the story of a vacationing family whose members find themselves set upon by scissor-wielding doppelgangers  but that doesn't quite make it a successful film. The final reveal feels too clever by half, the sort of thing that makes things less compelling upon further consideration instead of more. There are perhaps two or three themes too many  divine punishment, the divided self, our divided nation, even scientific overreach  for a film that is this heavy on fights and chases. And while it's delightful to get clues as to what lies ahead from the opening shot  a commercial for Hands Across America to end hunger playing on a TV flanked by VHS tapes for C.H.U.D., Goonies, and A Nightmare on Elm Street  the symbolism eventually starts to feel intrusive, even academic. The result is bloody but weirdly bloodless, a sort of thinky exercise in horror filmmaking. There's more juice in the laughs here than the scares, from the goofy way the ""shadow people"" parody their exemplars, to the groanworthy gag involving a botched Smart Home command. Still, there are exceptions: Lupita Nyong'o and Elisabeth Moss do fine, unnerving work in both their regular and irregular incarnations. Overall, it gives the impression of being a thoughtful crowd-pleaser, a combination which should be more than enough to grant Peele another shot at this sort of thing if he wants one. (2019)"

Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz A retro gross-out high school action-comedy based on the '80s TV show that ran for five years and gave Johnny Depp his big break and climb to stardom. Depp honors the pic with a cameo as an undercover cop. Uninteresting co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") take a good concept and fail to capitalize on it, as the witless comedy quickly descends into tiresome crude routines, the action sequences are tediously copied from numerous car chase movies, the storytelling part is poorly executed and the bromance becomes grating the more syrupy it becomes. It's based on a story by Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill. Dumb muscular jock Jenko (Channing Tatum, age 31) and nerdy loser misfit Schmidt (Jonah Hill, age 28) went to high school together, but were enemies. They are recent Police Academy graduates, where they get a chance to bond and become partners on a bicycle patrol. After bungling a narcotic arrest in the park, the police chief assigns them to work out of an abandoned church at 21 Jump Street. They report to the one-note overbearing foulmouthed tough cop Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) to work undercover as students in a high school, where a new synthetic drug killed a student. They are given new identities as brothers and ordered to live together in the house of Schmidt's parents. Their job is simply to infiltrate the drug dealers and then go after the supplier, which turns out to be a difficult assignment for these woeful cops who even manage to botch their new identities. The dealer is the gregarious brainy green-friendly folk singing Eric Molson (Dave Franco, James' younger brother), who is easy to befriend. But the supplier is more difficult to smoke out, and the dynamic duo have their hands full trying to cope again with high school subjects, gays, a generation gap and coeds while trying to catch the drug ring. Schmidt is attracted to drama queen Molly (Brie Larson), one of the girls who hangs around with Eric and reminds him of the type of girl he yearned for when a student but never could date. The buddy cop movie will probably appeal to the twenty-something demographic: or those who like potty humor, juvenile yuks, vile comedy that makes base references to genital parts, an ongoing stream of expletives and loud explosions in the action sequences.

Who among us spends significant time yearning to revisit '80s television, even with a series that spawned Johnny Depp's mega-career? Beyond that, the idea of undercover cops re-enrolling in high school to smash a drug ring doesn't pulsate with originality. And who wants to return to high school under any circumstances? All this by way of saying that the big-screen rendition of 21 Jump Street should have been a notable dud rather than an amusing (if intentionally silly) attempt to cast a parodic spell over a TV show that took itself fairly seriously. 21 Jump Street teams Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as screw-up police officers who are assigned to a unit that investigates youth crime and which is run by a scowling police captain played by Ice Cube . You can tell that the movie is more interested in comedy than credibility because Hill and Tatum  in defiance of the imperatives of any known gene pool  try to pass themselves off as brothers once they're assigned to a school. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) have one exceptionally smart trick up their sleeves. The script, based on a story by Hill and screenwriter Michael Bacall, flips the script on Hill and Tatum. Hill's Schmidt, a scorned nerd in high school, discovers that he actually fits into the the politically sensitive school environment of the 21st century. Suddenly, he's cool. Tatum's Jenko, a much-admired jock when he attended the high school, seems like a dumb oaf when seen through an updated contemporary lens. He gets roped into going to band practice, and is forced to figure out a way to fake his way through advanced chemistry. Hill has plenty of comic experience, but Tatum  usually cast as a gooey-eyed hunk in movies such as The Vow  handles his comic assignment with surprising aplomb, playing a character who can be dumb and dumber all by himself. Beyond that, Hill and Tatum work well enough together to keep the movie from tumbling into the usual garbage heap of crude, intentionally stupid humor. Their growing bromance seems heartfelt, encouragement that it's possible to outgrow high school prejudices. The supporting cast includes Brie Larson, as a high school drama student who thinks Schmidt's cool, and Dave Franco, brother of James Franco, as a high-school wheeler-dealer, who traffics in a drug that's supposed to break new ground in hallucinogenic experience. I could have done without the movie's noisy attempts at action which include a mind-numbing car chase  and not all of the jokes connect, but 21 Jump Street is the kind of movie that's best summed up by the collective sigh of relief it seems to have engendered from the critical community.

Now, that teen friendly cop show has been updated and unleashed in the post ""Hangover"" era  when no joke is out of bounds, no language is too profane, no riff on drugs or sex is too extreme. You'd expect a big screen version of ""21 Jump Street,"" the TV series that made Johnny Depp famous, to be a joke. And it is, a raunchy, violent and potty-mouthed farce that straddles the middle ground between ""Starsky & Hutch"" and ""Superbad."" It's ""Project X"" with pistols. The cute young cops here aren't Tiger Beat cute the way Depp and co-stars like Holly Robinson and Peter DeLuise were. And they're self-aware. They're incompetent, and they know it. New to the force, they haven't even memorized the Miranda Rights speech. ""They always cut away on TV before they finish!"" Jenko (Channing Tatum) complains. In high school, he was the popular, handsome jock who ""didn't learn a thing"" during his years there. Poor Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the insecure, unathletic brainiac who always choked when the chips were down  asking a girl to the prom, for instance. Jenko used to pick on Schmidt.

Maybe it was just the energy of the environment we were in  a large theater, SXSW, close to night-time; maybe a few had some liquor in them, maybe a few took some hits before entering the theater... or maybe they just loved it and I didn't, and it's as simple as that. I wouldn't consider myself much of a fan of Jonah Hill nor Channing Tatum, so strike 1 came before I even entered the theater; that and the fact that the initial multi-culturalism that I think many appreciated about the original TV series is pretty much nullified in this film adaptation, as is the concept of ""team."" Just call it the Hill and Tatum show, because that's what it is, with lots of silly, juvenile comedy that I'm sure college frat boy-types will love. Strike 2 happened about 15 or 20 minutes in when Ice Cube's undercover unit commander character was introduced. I get it; his exaggerated stereotypes were intentional and not to be at all taken seriously. His character even references the fact that he IS a walking stereotype  loud, gruff, and physical; Standard characteristics of your typical studio movie police chief/commander/whatever. Like said, I got it. But I still didn't care for any of it. Ice Cube isn't exactly what I'd call a good actor (in my humble opinion). His caricaturing was supposed to be funny, but I just found it all rather annoying. It's tough to isolate when strike 3 happens, because there's a lot I didn't like about this flick (more than I actually liked), like comedian DeRay Davis as Domingo, a street tough, bike-riding, tatooed drug dealer; but I'll settle on all the friggin' slo-mo shots (I recall at least one with doves flying out of a limo, as our leads exited it, *hot chicks* in tow). Yeah, it's that kind of movie; and some (maybe many) will probably have tons of fun watching it, and maybe I'm getting too old for this shit.

This big-screen update of the late-'80s TV drama  about twentysomething cops undercover as high school students  is shepherded by Jonah Hill (who stars, executive produces and shares a story credit). The film is not at all interested in the series' brooding melodrama, so why not hire a directorial duo poised to pull off live-action Looney Tunes elasticity? Quite a bit of Jump is brazen, brash and blustery. Too bad it's not more of a blast to watch. Michael Bacall's script too often restricts the anarchic energy Lord and Miller seem anxious to unleash. In its place are the same boring bits from the very sorts of movies Jump seeks to satirize. Not even this cacophonous comedy can shred the slavish laws of love interests and misunderstandings between pals. Honestly, Cloudy tweaked genre conventions with greater wit, verve and punch. Perhaps Lord and Miller, who wrote that film, should've gotten a crack at penning this one. After a promising start, Jump wastes many profane breaths trying to be persuasively zany. But only a freeway chase involving strangely non-combustible combustibles and a climactic three-limo shootout hit crazy-good heights of poking fun at overblown cop movies. Cut from the same cloth, both Hot Fuzz and The Other Guys fared better. It should also more regularly blast its secret weapon named Channing Tatum. Yes, that Channing Tatum. Tatum was a daft, daffy slab of beef in 2011's The Dilemma. However, nothing he's done suggests much skill at slapstick, deadpan, double takes or zingers. (Unfairly, some say nothing Tatum has done suggests much skill period.) Here, he's a reliable riot in every scene, often outshining Hill's growing-stale brand of frenzied shouting. With at least five gutbusters to call his own in Jump, Tatum gives a breakout performance even if the film never quite breaks out. In a brief prologue, bleached-blond, brace-faced Schmidt (Hill) barely works up the nerve to ask his high school's resident hot girl to prom, only to be shot down by her and mocked by Jenko (Tatum)  a longhaired jock who will just barely graduate. Seven years later, Jenko and Schmidt reunite at a police academy. Schmidt struggles with the physical fitness. Jenko struggles with the mental aptitude. Free of high school's petty hierarchy, each gives the other a hand to graduate. But bike patrol at a lakeside park is not the law-enforcement badassery they envisioned. There's no way a flashing set of cherries on a Schwinn is ever intimidating. Almost in spite of themselves, Jenko and Schmidt make a major drug bust that seems a ticket to bigger, badder beats.

For the new 21 Jump Street, the existing history of the famous young Johnny Deep cop drama from the late 80's is embraced, alluded to (watch for former surprise old cast member cameos, including Depp himself), and is the springboard for new modern direction, within minimum need for a new origin. This adaptation is more a revival than anything else. Much like Pixar veterans Brad Bird (Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol) and Andrew Stanton (last week's John Carter), the directing team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller make their live-action feature debut after their successful animated take on Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Teaming up with screenwriter Michael Bacall (Project X and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World) and initial story starter (and headliner) Jonah Hill, their collective decision to turn the serious 80's cop procedural source into a raunchy R-rated action comedy is done to superior success. In this interpretation of 21 Jump Street, we are quickly introduced through an opening montage to the nerdy castoff Morgan Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and cocky jock Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum), two Class of 2005 high school opposites who reconnect at the police academy after pairing their mutual strengths to help each other pass. As bottom-of-the-totem-pole rookies, they are reduced to bike patrol in the park. After idiotically blowing a big arrest that would have got them out of playground duty, their captain (a smooth Nick Offerman appearance from Parks and Recreation) sees their young and dumb potential and transfers them to the Jump Street division. Led by the surly Captain Dickson (Ice Cube, living up to part of his character name), Jump Street is a revival of an undercover program from the 80's designed to use young-looking officers to infiltrate and thwart crimes among minors. Schmidt and Jenko are assigned by Dickson to go undercover at a local high school to stop a deadly new synthetic drug (street name HFS) from spreading to more schools. Specifically, their mission is to get in with the dealers and find the suppliers. Thinking it's going to be a piece of cake, the two find high school has gone green, emo, and sensitive since their days. Upon mixing their up their cover identities and flipping their comfortable stereotypes, Schmidt ends up on Jenko's cool guy jock track while the beefy Jenko ends up surrounding by the chemistry nerds. Out of their element, they meet a bevy of connections and suspects between a local biker gang (led by comedian DeRay Davis), teachers (including The Office's Ellie Kemper and comedians Rob Riggle, Chris Parnell, and Jake Johnson) and students, including popular alpha male Eric (David Franco, just as cackling and annoying as his big brother James) and theater doll Molly"
147,FSZ_Doc7_21_Jump_Street,FSZ_Doc7_21_Jump_Street,FSZ,Comedy,Positive,21_Jump_Street,"Nothing about 21 Jump Street sounds very promising. Hollywood's obsession with rebooting yesteryear's franchises carries on, here reinvigorating the eponymous 1987-1991 Fox TV series (in which Johnny Depp became a household name). Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller make their live-action debut with a complete 180-degree turnaround, putting forth an R-rated action comedy. In addition to Jonah Hill, who debuts his first post-weight-loss appearance on the big screen, the cast features Channing Tatum, whose own track record and inability to project emotion left this critic less than optimistic. It's part buddy cop actioner, part high-school romance, part stoner comedy, and just by the look of it, the cliches are overflowing. And yet, here's a movie that's aware of all its cliches, but somehow, with no limit of energy and humor, uses our awareness of these formulas as its strength. What works best about 21 Jump Street is the odd couple pairing of Hill and Tatum, who play Schmidt and Jenko, first seen in the 2005-set prologue in which Schmidt is your classic nerd (braces, no confidence, etc.) and Jenko is a prototypical jock (brawn, no brains, gets all the girls). Cut to a few years later when, after meeting again at the police academy, they become friends. Leaving aside their former social statuses, Schmidt helps Jenko with his studies, and Jenko helps Schmidt with the physical stuff. They both graduate, screw up on their first day, and land themselves in a reject undercover project that tests their friendship by placing them back in high school, albeit undercover, to sniff out a synthetic drug ring. It's all predictable up to this point until both realize that in contemporary high schools, Jenko's brand of too-cool-for-school isn't cool at all, and Schmidt's former nerdisms have become characteristics of the cool crowd. ""Environmental awareness, being tolerant,"" Schmidt says, baffled. ""If only I'd been born ten years later!"" And so, burly Tatum spends his screentime playing science with a trio of chemistry wizzes, and Hill's sensitive, easygoing sense of humor grabs the attention of yearbook-editing drug dealer Eric (Dave Franco, young brother of James) and his down-to-earth heartthrob Molly (Brie Larson). Inevitably, Jenko learns what it was like for Schmidt to be a loser, and Schmidt gets to relive high school as a cool kid, effectively losing himself in his cover. Playing against type yet fulfilling his dumb musclehead role, I dare say that Tatum shows potential. Hill is funnier and more likable than he's ever been, finding a happy medium between the raunchy desperation of Superbad and the low-key sarcasm that earned him an Oscar nomination on Moneyball. Chris Parnell plays a drama teacher with tales of New York (""upstate... Albany""), Ellie Kemper is a chemistry teacher who can't take her eyes off the uniquely buff new student in class, and Rob Riggle is an unstable gym teacher. Best of all, Ice Cube plays their always-yelling chief who shouts, ""Embrace your stereotypes!"" and in turn emphasizes the movie's"
148,FSZ_Doc8_21_Jump_Street,FSZ_Doc8_21_Jump_Street,FSZ,Comedy,Positive,21_Jump_Street,"In the year of our lord two-thousand-and-twelve, did anyone expect there to be a ""21 Jump Street"" movie? Were people clamoring for a ""21 Jump Street"" movie? Has some obscure cable network been playing re-runs of the 80s teen cop drama, stirring up a rabid underground network of fans chanting ""Jump Street"", ""Jump Street"", ""Jump Street""? And what's more, possibly the biggest of these questions, did anyone actually expect ""21 Jump Street"" to be really good? Because it is. I'm as surprised as anyone. I anticipated a complete and utter disaster, but it's serious laughs from beginning to end. ""21 Jump Street"" walks a delicate line of being self-aware and self-deprecating without being obnoxious. It knows exactly what it is, an unnecessary rehash, and pokes fun at itself every perfectly paced step of the way. But you don't watch it thinking it's another one of those movies painfully reflexive movies. It's like the filmmakers can't believe they made a ""21 Jump Street"" movie either, and they're totally going to mock themselves for it. This is the best popcorn movie of the year so far. And for a big, dumb movie, ""21 Jump Street"" is not only hysterical, it's much more clever than you initially suspect. ""Jump Street"" takes the conventions and tropes of teen films and cop movies and turns them on their ear. There's nothing earth shattering or astonishing, but the film take things you've seen 1000 times and tweaks them in small ways so you don't feel like you're watching something you've seen 1000 times, even though you are. There are high-speed car chases, epic high-school parties, an undercover cop in too deep, and a gearing up for the final battle scene. Hell, there's even a slow motion shot of doves flying away as the good guys walk with grim determination. That's been done to death, and mocked to death, but ""21 Jump Street"" approaches it in a way that makes it fresh and funny and that works. The story isn't much to anyone familiar with the show: two rookie cops, Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Academy Award Nominee Jonah Hillif I were him I would require people to refer to me as that every time I was about to drop a fart joke), blow their first bust. Because they look like twelve-year-olds they get bounced to a covert unit that places undercover officers in high schools, located at the eponymous 21 Jump Street. As the chief (Nick Offerman) says, they can't come up with anything original, and this is some ""recycled shit from the past."" Back in the day Jenko was super popular while Schmidt was a chubby, Eminem-looking outcast. However, things have changed since they roamed the hallways. Now the cool kids care, they study, they love the environment and comic books, and the two best buds find their former roles reversed in this brave new world. Hill's stumbly awkward humor is personable and falls in a middle ground between his roles in ""Moneyball"" and ""Superbad""."
149,FSZ_Doc9_21_Jump_Street,FSZ_Doc9_21_Jump_Street,FSZ,Comedy,Positive,21_Jump_Street,"Looking for laughter this weekend? Then jump on over to 21 JUMP STREET. This is The Funniest Film Of The Year! A devotee of the original ""21 Jump Street"" tv series that catapulted Johnny Depp into stardom, I never envisioned a translation of the series to the big screen, let alone a big screen comedy. Didn't think it even possible, if it was to be done successfully and respectful to the tv series. Not only is it possible, but 21 JUMP STREET is the most raucous, rowdy, riotous, raunchy and ridiculously funny film of the year. I belly-laughed and guffawed from beginning to end. And the kicker of it all? 21 JUMP STREET is also filled with heart and camaraderie, not to mention references to everything pop culture has to offer for the past 30 years. And oh yeah.....it has the best cameo performances ever seen on film!! One of the most unlikely, but inspired pairings, to hit the silver screen, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are Schmidt and Jenko, respectively. High school seniors in 2005, each has his own angst to deal with. For Schmidt, it's his Eminem-influenced style meshed with braces, klutziness and honor roll nerdiness. As for Jenko, he is the epitome of a Ken doll. Tall, handsome, athletic, chick magnet, but a cocky, ignorant, jackass. Fast forward to 2012 and our boys are struggling in life. Schmidt is still living at home with his parents, trying to fit in and find a career. Jenko has learned that you need some brains to go with the brawn. Not seeing each other since high school, imagine their surprise when they reconnect at training for the Metro City Police Department. Ultimately making it through the Academy and graduating (barely), Schmidt and Jenko are partnered and put on a beat  a bicycle beat in the park, near ponds, with children and senior citizens. Wanting some excitement and anxious to make an arrest, hilarity ensues when they see a gang of bikers smoking pot. Needless to say, they botch the arrest (Jenko never learned the Miranda) and are kicked over to Jump Street. Designed for high school undercover work, long-dormant Jump Street has been reactivated thanks to a fresh break-out of teen trouble and a new hallucinogenic drug on the market. Helmed by the foul-mouthed, fast-talking Captain Dickson, our boys are assigned to pose as brothers Doug and Brad, and return to high school, a prospect that frightens Schmidt and elates Jenko. Their assignment  infiltrate the drug operation first though the dealer and then get the distributor before it goes viral and canft be contained within the one school. And there's a caveat  Under no circumstances are they to do anything to get expelled. With 30 days left in the semester, the clock is ticking which means the boys have got to get a jump on things  and fast. But their first problem, how do you fit in now when you didn't fit in before? Surprisingly, the"

The film premiered ten years ago at SXSW. I mean, it's SXSW. If you want to launch a comedy in the spring, you must premiere at SXSW. Neighbors. Blockers. Long Shot. Booksmart. The list goes on and on. Austin offers one of the best experiences by far. SXSW is my favorite film festival because of the experience. I'm only sorry that I cannot attend this year because transgender rights are under attack. ""We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle shit from the past and expect us all not to notice.""  Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) I keep coming back to this quote over the years because it's so true. While some original films make it through the cracks, almost everything these days is a sequel, reboot, or remake. No matter how much we collectively complain about this, our wallets are what do the talking and we keep rewarding Hollywood for this behavior. The end result is more of the same and they just recycle the same old shit and expect us not to notice. It's been ten years and nothing has changed. The release of 21 Jump Street was followed by a sequel, 22 Jump Street. The sequel features an indefensible transphobic scene. I've yet to reach out to Phil Lord and Chris Miller about this but I'd like to think that they'd do things differently. The comedy movie is set within the same universe as the dramatic TV series. Naturally, both Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise make cameo appearances. Thankfully, the studio did not not market the cameos. This decision works for the film. Once you know that the originals are in it, it takes away from the experience. Personally, I prefer the jaw-dropping shock than know spoilers in advance. You might feel differently, of course. We first meet Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) when they're in high school. Cut to seven years later and they're both students at the Metropolitan City Police Academy. They weren't friends in school but they become friends during the academy and on bike patrol. I love how they joke about ending up on bike patrol. Movies just aren't realistic because they historically show rookie cops out in the field and running from explosions and such. When they finally catch one of the one percenters, Jenko doesn't read him the Miranda rights and so all the charges got dropped. It's soon thereafter that they meet with Deputy Chief Hardy and get resigned to 21 Jump Street. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them to Sagan High School in order to stop HFS from spreading. They might have a fresh start to experiencing high school all over"
151,IIC_Doc1_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc1_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Positive,No_Time_To_Die,"Craig has certainly taken Bond into deeper waters than ever before, putting him in touch with the zeitgeist, but along the way something important has gone missing. His best scene is still the one on the train in Casino Royale where he meets Lynd for the first time. It points to what might have been had he gone on nurturing his sense of humour. I am not into Bond, but Craig so I was going to see ""No Time to Die"" whenever it got released, pandemic or not. With a two-hour forty-three minute run time, I went in a little daunted because as much as I like Craig, a three hour Bond movie does not sound like a good idea especially when ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) exists. The time flew by, and I am happy to report that it is an entertaining film that feels like an apology for Spectre's short-comings and satisfyingly concludes Craig's reign. While it is no ""Casino Royale"" (2006) or ""Skyfall"" (2012), I would watch it again. ""No Time to Die"" starts like a horror film. I never understood what the franchise saw in Madeleine Swann, Bond's latest love interest from ""Spectre,"" but in this film, the franchise finally fleshed out her character to get us invested in her plotline and retroactively made her careless actions in the prior installment make sense. If she has been fighting this long, you too would go for a walk without protection at night. It makes sense that this film got released in October because Swann as a final girl against the Boogeyman was more interesting than as the latest in a long line of women to fall for Bond's charms. I went from rolling my eyes over the trope that brunettes were bad, and blondes were good until this film. The writers and Lea Seydoux redeemed Swann by distinguishing her independently from her relationship with the protagonist. Even without Bond, I could appreciate her instinct for survival, severely missing though touted in her initial appearance in the prior installment. As a Bond film, ""No Time to Die"" pays homage to the franchise's mythology, and every recurring character has a moment in the spotlight. If you watch Bond movies to learn more about Bond than saving the world, then you may be pleased to know that it ties up a lot of loose ends for the character without sacrificing what we enjoy about the character. Craig's action sequences are memorable whether he is in a shootout in Cuba, pulling a Rambo in a stunning Norwegian forest sequence or fighting the baddie's henchmen on his island lair in the denouement. There is also a lot of unexpected humor amidst the pathos as years of fornicating finally catch up to him, and he faces the consequences of loving and leaving them. Craig plays it wordlessly with sensitivity and conveys everything about this awkward realization in a kitchen scene where he makes breakfast in Swann's house."
152,IIC_Doc2_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc2_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Positive,No_Time_To_Die,"When Daniel Craig's gritty take on Bond first debuted back in 2006, it was a welcome change from the tired, campy antics of Pierce Brosnan's superspy. An audience recently introduced to Jason Bourne hungered for something different  a Bond who was altogether more human, more relatable. Barbara Brocolli's decision to hire Craig  who, at the time, couldn't have looked more wrong for the part with his granite-faced stoicism feeling particularly un-Bondlike  was a masterstroke, as was the decision to strip the series back to its roots with Casino Royale. Then came Quantum of Solace and the revelation that the Craig era of Bond would be a long-form style of storytelling. This was also a welcome change: in the Golden Age of television where long-form storytelling is at its apex, it felt right to have a Bond whose journey would not be contained to one cinematic outing. It's hard to believe, but it's been sixteen years since Daniel Craig first slipped into 007's tuxedo, and he's aged into the role beautifully. His debut as the ultimate spy in Casino Royal marked the first time the action franchise made an effort, however small, to modernize the series by broadening gender and racial representation, playing down Bond's misogyny, and playing up the character's psychological complexity. Craig, arguably the most talented Bond performer since Sean Connery, expresses more than just determination, anger, and self-satisfaction. He has deeper feelings  often conflicted. He's even capable of love. No Time to Die is an exciting final chapter for Craig's Bond, even though at close to three hours long the story does suffer from a little fat around the midriff. The same can't be said for Craig, who could easily compete against Brad Pitt for best male upper torso in the over-50 category. No Time to Die starts off with one of the most thrilling pre-credit sequences ever, and, clocking in at over twenty minutes, it's hands down the longest. There's a frightening home invasion that provides a backstory payoff later in the film, three death-defying stunts, and a car chase involving Bond driving the DB5 Aston Martin made famous in Goldfinger, complete with embedded arsenal, culminating with a nail-biting moment when it looks like bullet-proof glass won't be enough to save him. After the obligatory CGI-animated title sequence, accompanied by a disappointingly lethargic Billie Eilish song, the story picks up five years later; Bond is enjoying his retirement from MI6 in Jamaica, even though his enemies, old and new, are still at work. Christoph Waltz, in a scene straight out of The Silence of the Lambs, reprises his role as Blofeld, the ultimate puppet-master. A new threat comes in the form of Lyutsifer Safin, played by Rami Malik. Safin, with his creepy voice affectation and equally creepy complexion, is a fun throwback to classical bond villainy bent on upending the world order. Suffice to say, it doesn't take long for Bond to become reacquainted with his trusty Walther PPK."
153,IIC_Doc3_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc3_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Negative,No_Time_To_Die,"Craig's Bond has been marinating in distrust and trauma since that climactic betrayal in Casino Royale, something that has arguably worked splendidly for the franchise, rooting it in real-world opacity. And to Craig's credit, he embodies the stiff upper-lipped Mi6 agent to perfection, instead of being the one firing zingers in every scene. Which is why it's shocking that the No Time To Die makers saddle him with melodramatic lines like ""We all have our secrets, we just didn't get to yours yet."" But then again, that's probably the 'pitch' of Fukunaga's film. Now, only if they had shown more conviction to deliver a sappy finale for Craig's final outing as James Bond. Fukanaga delivers a good-looking movie with a couple of fine action sequences, but No Time to Die doesn't dazzle. In the wake of Skyfall (2011), it's difficult to imagine another James Bond movie looking half as good, thereby making every subsequent entry a mild disappointment. Cinematographer Linus Sandgren uses a foggy Norwegian forest for a gorgeous shootout, and production designer Mark Tildesley creates some memorable sets, particularly the cell holding Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and Lyutsifer's aforementioned lair. There's an impressive extended take, recalling the one in Atomic Blonde (2017), where Bond makes his way up some stairs and takes out a barrage of bad guys, and it's edited together to look like a single shot. Somehow, all of this makes less of an impact than Lisa-Dorah Sonnet, the little girl who plays the daughter of Madeline and Bond. Her delicate presence and quiet French voice humanize our hero in a way not felt since Casino Royale. They remind us that beneath the surface of Craig's Bond, his harsh expressions, clenched jaw, and alcohol dependency, lies someone wounded, melancholic, and in need of someone else to love and trust. Bond sequels have always recycled elements from its predecessors. But No Time to Die, the 25th film in the franchise, reaches back half a century to borrow almost exclusively from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Many Bond aficionados consider it one of the best in the series, if not THE best, so the filmmakers could do worse. Nonetheless, pilfering so many ideas, and even the musical cues, from one particular film may be the surest sign yet that 007 movies are starting to run on fumes, if they hadn't been already. Of course, that's not going stop anyone from producing more. ""James Bond,"" the words at the end of the closing credits assure us, ""will return."""
154,IIC_Doc4_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc4_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Positive,No_Time_To_Die,"James Bond has and always will be one of the most unique franchises around. With a legacy that spans nearly six decades, it has found new directions, as well as old patterns, to thrive in any era a new film releases. There's an extraordinary amount of expectation for any actor who inhabits this famous role, but there has been something distinct about the tenure of Daniel Craig. His modern interpretation is the longest on record, and as such, his impact on the series has been enormous. It's been well documented that ""No Time to Die"" would be his final bow as the character. One can definitely feel that thesis statement throughout this film, which ends up being an enthralling and finely crafted sendoff. Daniel Craig bids farewell to James Bond in this much-delayed action romp. We happily report that after more than a year on the shelf, a revolving door of directors, writers, and extended time in development hell, No Time To Die more than satisfied us as casual Bond fans. Craig returns to the role of Bond in top dramatic and physical form, while director Cary Joji Fukunaga turns in some wild, raucous action sequences. The plot: several years after retiring from MI6, Bond has fallen in love with the beautiful Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) and looks forward to domestic life. An attack by the nefarious Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) breaks up the couple and sends Bond into a tailspin. Mysterious murders of some of Blofeld's former associates leads the former agent back to M (Ralph Fiennes), and to a secret government project hijacked by the mysterious Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), an eccentric alchemist bent on destroying Blofeld. As mentioned, Craig comes back to the role of Bond in full form, while Waltz and Malek both deliver the goods in terms of creepy Bond villainy. The real standout here, however, is writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge (of Fleabag), who adds a hearty dose of charm and wit to the mayhem. Bond Girls have never had this much personality, grit or wit before as exemplified by Lashana Lynch's new 007, and in particular by Ana De Armas (Knives Out), whose brief, ass-kicking cameo damn near steals the movie. Fans of Ben Whishaw should also rejoice at his amount of screentime in this installment, and a dash of queerness added to his character. With Craig exiting the role, we'd love to see Lynch, Armas and Whishaw get their own spinoff. Note to Amazon/MGM: we're here for it. It's a must-see for anyone. Movies have gotten a lot more sophisticated since 1903, but filmmakers have kept coming back to the image of a man and a firearm, across several genres, often to romanticize dog-eared notions of virility and prowess, but in later decades with the intention of deconstructing these figures."
155,IIC_Doc5_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc5_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Negative,No_Time_To_Die,"No Time to Die, the latest and last appearance of Daniel Craig as James Bond, is a lot of movie. It's so much movie that one hardly knows where to begin. So let's start with the runtime, which carries on for 165 minutes. Long movies don't deter me, assuming the time is well spent, but this one felt overstuffed. Director Cary Joji Fukanaga, the first American director to helm an entry in the franchise's 60-year history, gives the audience plenty to contemplate, and not all of it feels essential or necessary. Fukanaga and his posse of screenwritersincluding Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridgeconcoct a script chock full of elaborate plotting, drearily murky characters, and weighty themes. These writers have much to do, crafting the final Craig entry. Directed to frazzled, ambitious life by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the result is a grand affair befitting the shoddy arc this phase of the Bond franchise fashioned out of its glamour and gunfire. But in its forceful attempts to expand the scope of this run's sincerity as well as its spectacle, Craig's finale doesn't feel like it's coming full circle so much as arriving at inevitable destinations, beckoned there by a bleary-eyed script overanxious to satisfy the widest swath of moviegoers. ""No Time To Die"" arrives six years after ""Spectre,"" a movie of misbegotten construction but peppered with intriguing metatextual wrinkles which time has revealed, and while this may not be the worst of the Craig-era Bond flicks, it is the most redundant. When the smoke of its many explosions subsides, we find a film operating less by its own ethos than the familiar trajectory blockbuster movies have taken since this double-oh tallied his first official kills in 2006. Speaking of explosions, the first doesn't come until about 20 minutes into ""No Time To Die,"" a noticeable and purposeful delay propelling Bond out of yet another sunny retirement with Lea Seydoux's Madeleine Swann, returning an unconvincing romantic dynamic from ""Spectre."" He looks to be at peace, his cold heart defrosted by Italian sunshine and Madeleine's insistence that he visit the local cemetery to heal the wounds he suffered the last time he was swallowed up by love in Venice. There's a nagging, slightly frustrating suspicion that Bond should know better than to trust the solitude. Sure enough, the guardrails go back up as he's yanked into another story of layered revenge and deceit. Where ""No Time To Die"" deviates from formulas both recent and traditional is in its placement of Bond in his own story. The core delight of these movies lies in watching 007 keep up with foes who are constantly one step ahead of him, in entering the shadows not knowing what traps or betrayals lie in wait. In ""No Time To Die,"" the enemies are behind him, and gaining fast (despite a five-year time jump hastened along by Billie Eilish's melancholic anthem).

While contemplating how preferable a happily ever after ending might've beenwith Bond and his newfound brood playing on an isolated beach somewhere in the Caribbean, perhapsconsider a plot hole that may have saved our hero. When Q (Ben Whishaw, delightful as ever) gives Bond a watch that can release an EMP, the 007 uses the pulse to detonate a bionic eye inside a henchman's head. So why can't Bond use the same pulse to neutralize nanobots? After all, they're microscopic machines, right? And if that wouldn't work, couldn't Q cook something up in the lab? In any case, the movie's rules concerning this EMP are wildly inconsistent. At one point, Bond opens several electronic locks with his EMP, but it somehow doesn't affect his radio earpiece. Although quibbles of this nature are best left to fanboy forums, the point is that the ending feels unearned and sloppy. The writers are more interested in propelling Bond to his demise than crafting a situation that feels like Bond's death is necessary. What's next, then? Perhaps it's another origin story on par with Casino Royale. James Bond seems to be taking the path of Batman and Spider-Man, where every few years the studios will start over with a new actor. a new timeline. But more than thatand this is the banality of itthey will doubtlessly retell his origin story and create a new Bondverse. Of course, James Bonds have come and gone over the years, but they rarely had beginnings or endingsnot to the extent of Craig's version, anyway. Earlier films did not build a universe in the manner of the MCU. It was unclear if Moore's Bond had experienced everything Connery's had, and that never mattered before. But general audiences today may expect a more connected cinematic universe, which makes Bond somehow more temporary. No Time to Die certainly proves he's mortal. Will the same be true of the franchise? It's both rewarding to see Craig's version receive some finality but also grating to think that we might be introduced to another new recruit"
157,IIC_Doc7_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc7_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Negative,No_Time_To_Die,"I didn't come from a Bond family, and I will not say this performance is the definitive Bond. But I will say that the more I reflect on it Daniel Craig feels like the only person who could have shepherded this role from the highs of Casino Royale to the place it ended up. His installments were increasingly self-serious, bruising, and sometimes dull. But they did seem to be aware of the heart of the man, even if they could only sometimes sell us on the chemistry.** If James Bond needed a reason to go out, Craig is maybe the only person who could've sold us on it. For a franchise that began in 1962, which has now clocked up its 25th entry, the most difficult moments arrive when new actors are introduced to take on the roles of familiar, beloved characters. Some of these characters have been replaced several times over, including the central figure of Secret Agent 007. Sean Connery, the original Bond, who appeared in the role officially on six occasions is still widely regarded as the best. Roger Moore would make seven appearances, and Pierce Brosnan four. Aussie George Lazenby made only one film as James Bond before leaving of his own volition. Timothy Dalton quit after two movies and has hardly been heard of since. With five appearances spread out over 15 years Daniel Craig has played Bond for a longer period than any other actor, imprinting his image on the minds of a generation of viewers  viewers conditioned by social media to have the shortest attention spans in history. So when Craig announces that the new Bond, No Time to Die, will be his last, it sets up a huge buzz of speculation. Will they kill him off? Will they reveal a successor? And for the actor himself, is there life after James Bond? One suspects he'll come through more successfully than Lazenby or Dalton. The knowledge that this will be Craig's last fling exerts an influence on the way the plot unfolds, and the way we view the film. It's not an entirely happy influence because it makes the action seem more than usually mechanical, and allows little scope for other characters to develop convincing personalities. Trust is difficult to come by in the spy game. So are happy endings, apparently. Craig's finale (which I will discuss in detail, so skip this paragraph if you must) feels wrong. Certainly, Bond was bound to lose his life sooner or later. You can only save the world from supervillains for so long before one of them gets the best of you. But the climactic scenes in No Time to Die feel undeserving. Malek's scenery-chewing performance as Lyutsifer finds him pontificating about how he and Bond are both heroes marked by the past. There's a scuffle, and Lyutsifer scratches Bond with a cracked vial of blood. He has been infected with nanobots that will infect Madeline and Mathilde if they come in contact with Bond."
158,IIC_Doc8_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc8_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Negative,No_Time_To_Die,"There is a small nod to the present state of the world in the dreaded super weapon being a biological agent designed to target a particular person's DNA and spread on close contact. In the fantastic, exaggerated Bond universe this vision of a world overcome by a viral menace felt almost comforting in its plausibility. Following a raid on a top-secret laboratory in which the villains steal a deadly biological weapon, Bond is contacted by his CIA friend, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), to help recover the goods. This leads to some inevitable mayhem at a party in Havana, given by the criminal gang, Spectre, that Bond infiltrates in company with a new character named Paloma (Ana de Armas). She turns out to be one of the few bright sparks in this industrially-produced story, but her entry and exit are brief. Another new character who looks set to hang around, is Nomi (Lashana Lynch), a brassy young black woman who has been given Bond's old designation of 007. Immediately it seems as if the future of the franchise has been revealed: the new 007 will be black and female! But is it really possible? Could a woman be the same kind of practised seducer as Bond and get away with it? The filmmakers appear to be testing the waters. While Nomi will get a rousing cheer from the PC brigade this is not the standard demographic for Bond audiences who have traditionally favoured the same old blend of hyper-masculinity, dry wit and aggression. If Nomi were locked in as the next Bond she might have commanded a bigger, more prominent role in No Time to Die. Instead, she is hardly more than a supporting character, missing from most of the big scenes. She is a tease rather than a certainty. Christoph Waltz's Blofeld is still in the mix as a supervillain, even while imprisoned in a maximum security cell in London, but he is not Bond's major nemesis. That distinction belongs to Rami Malek, as the wonderfully named Lyutsifer Safin, who has his own complex backstory and the kind of Count Dracula accent that is de rigueur for Bond baddies. The same applies to the nasty scientist, Dr. Obruchev (David Dencik), who also seems to have taken elocution lessons in Transylvania. It's nice to know some things never change. With a James Bond movie what's important for most viewers is not the story, but the unchanging recipe of car and motorbike chases; gun fights and martial arts contests; seductions; explosions; split-second escapes; gizmos and gadgets; and the moment when 007 says: ""Bond, James Bond"". No Time to Die has all of the above, but not much else."
159,IIC_Doc9_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc9_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Positive,No_Time_To_Die,"Cary Fukunaga's No Time to Die, the twenty-fifth canonical James Bond film, is the best one since Peter Hunt's On Her Majesty's Secret Service and for many of the same reasons. One could hazard that the similarities, a vulnerable Bond chief among them, comprise the guiding principle behind this picture, with its multiple call-outs to Fleming's booksOn Her Majesty's Secret Service, in particular, along with its downbeat, mortal sequel You Only Live Twice, the last Bond Fleming completed himself. In the latter, 007's boss, M, uses the same Jack London quote to eulogize the presumed-dead superspy (""The proper function of a man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time"") that his screen counterpart (Ralph Fiennes) uses to eulogize Bond in No Time to Die. It ends with Bond, initially dumbstruck by grief over the death of his wife in the previous novel (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), now stricken by amnesia and about to abandon his impregnated wifethe child a development Fleming never got to bring to term, but who finds her fruition in Fukunaga's film. At a late point in No Time to Die, two combatants reaching the end of their struggles agree that the only reason to live is to leave a legacy. I find it touching that this film brings a small and precious note of Fleming's to life, so many years after his death. You Only Live Twice also features the return of arch-fiend Blofeld, who, dressed as a Samurai warrior, has grown a ""Garden of Death"" in a castle on a remote Japanese island to which people are drawn to kill themselves. No Time to Die updates the ""garden of death"" idea in a stunning set-piece on another island where the infernal Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) has nursed an entire biome of psychotropic, mind-controlling, and otherwise deadly plants. It's the scaled-up version of the Lois Smith character's botanical nightmares in Minority Report, or even General Sternwood's perverse hothouse in Chandler's The Big Sleep. Safin's plan is to wipe out millions using a nanobot-aided virus engineered to target specific DNA markers harvested through the hacking of medical databases. It's the stuff of our most paranoid fantasies: a pandemic, a viral plague exacerbated by an uncontrolled (and uncontrollable) personal information leak, and a ""cure"" consisting of liquid technologies that have loosed themselves from any governmental control. No Time to Die, among all the things it is, is absolutely inextricable from this moment at the end of our timeline. The film has about it the elegiac notes of a writer in Fleming who, quite ill from heart disease for the last three years of his life, must have known his time was short; and of a suicide note for a superhero who has grown weary and been made mad by the things he's seen and done in the name of God and the Queen. No Time to Die opens with Bond in Italy,"
160,IIC_Doc10_No_Time_To_Die,IIC_Doc10_No_Time_To_Die,IIC,Action,Positive,No_Time_To_Die,"t has been a remarkably long time coming, but No Time to Die has finally emerged in cinemas around the world. It ends the second-longest hiatus in the history of the James Bond movie franchise  close to six years, and second only to the gap between License to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995). That delay was the result of a long and costly legal dispute; this one seems a combination of switching directors and holding off its release during the COVID pandemic until enough cinemas were open to have even a chance of recouping a $250m+ production cost. That is the commercial pressure. There is also a creative challenge in that with No Time to Die, the franchise concludes its first-ever actively serialised narrative. Casino Royale (2006) introduced Daniel Craig to the role and acted very much as an origin story for the character. Quantum of Solace (2008) was the first direct sequel, and while Skyfall (2012) very much charted its own course Spectre (2015) awkwardly tried to shoe-horn all three preceding movies into one messy, half-hearted narrative. Now with No Time to Die Craig is retiring from the role, and all of the flailing and conflicted story and character threads need to all be tied up and finished. Tied up they are, not perfectly but in a manner that is arguably better than the earlier films deserved. Casino Royale was an absolute five-star knockout, enhancing and detailing the character of Bond in a way never done before. It also restored a sense of heightened realism that had been missing from the films for some years. So strong was the character work in Casino Royale that it took an entire sequel to finish 'dotting the Is and crossing the Ts', so to speak, and finally rendering in unprecedented detail the international super-spy audiences had been watching in cinemas since 1962. Quantum of Solace is perhaps the most underrated Bond movie yet made  depending on your opinion of License to Kill  and despite some script problems (production coincided with a writers' strike) works as a superb mirror piece to Casino Royale. Note that, as a two-part story, it both begins and ends on Bond with a gun waiting on a man. That the events of each scene differ signal the enormous change in the character during the intervening adventures. It is weird that with Skyfall, widely promoted as a nostalgia-filled anniversary celebration, the producers chose to take a Bond that had been perfectly set up to start his espionage career proper and immediately send him to the end of it instead. The Bond of Skyfall is a retired and reluctant figure, who takes the first opportunity to quit his profession altogether before being dragged back into it. The shadowy Quantum organisation, which underpinned the events of the first two films, is also entirely ignored. Spectre brought the plot back in order to subsume it under the return of its titular 1960s criminal group and its leader Ernst Stavro"

It gets as far as desperate.Hobbled by sitcom plotting and painfully obvious comic setups, Dirty Grandpa can also boast tone-deaf casting, heavy-handed writing and the mistaken belief that putting the f-word into the wrong mouth can be funny. Maybe the first time it can be. Not the 847th. Robert De Niro is Dick Kelly, the filthy old man in question  his name is Dick! That's funny already!  and Zac Efron is Jason Kelly, his buttoned-down corporate lawyer grandson. The movie opens with family photos of the two hanging out during Jason's childhood, so you know they used to be tight; in present day, Grandpa's just been widowed and Jason is a totally uptight dweeb with a hectoring fiancee (Julianne Hough) and a dull life.Grandpa engineers a road trip. He wants to go to Boca Raton, just as he has done every other year at this time, and he insists Jason must drive him to Florida.But the old guy has an agenda.Gramps knows that under that uptight exterior, Jason is still a free spirit. He doesn't want Jason to settle for a dull life and the wrong wife, and he knows that he can set Jason free with enough booze, drugs, parties and nubile coeds. Instead of going to Boca Raton, he manipulates Jason into driving to Daytona Beach, where young women in bikinis frolic in slow motion.This is a grandpa who thinks nothing of putting a few Xanax into Jason's beer, so Jason will chill out. Come on  everyone knows date rape drugs are funny!This is a movie that offers Robert De Niro masturbating to porn as its hilarious opening salvo. Then, because granddad and Jason are in a pink car, De Niro gets to deliver a string of tampon and vagina jokes about the vehicle. It goes downhill from there.If you squint, you could maybe see a Colin Quinn or a Billy Bob Thornton pulling off this role, not that either is old enough  provided the whole thing were recast, rewritten and directed by someone else  but it just makes no sense for De Niro.As for the rest of the cast, you know how actors such as Colin Quinn and Dave Attell and Tilda Swinton floated through the movie Trainwreck, and their characters made sense in the story, and it was seamless and hilarious?That's exactly what doesn't happen in Dirty Grandpa. Jason Mantzoukas turns up as a stoner, Parks and Recreation's Mo Collins is a wiseacre cop, Adam Pally is an idiot psycho cousin and Aubrey Plaza is a dense nympho undergrad  actually, Aubrey Plaza may be the only amusing character in the whole thing. The rest stick out like sore thumbs, not through any fault of their"

Steady on. That's far too kind.True, it may appeal to those suffering from dementia. Short-term memory loss needn't be a problem, with a script that reminds us every five minutes that recently widowed Dick (De Niro, not at his best, to put it mildly) wants to screw a college girl, enjoys goosing his pretty grandson (Zac Efron) and thinks the worst thing a man can be is a hen-pecked ""vagina"". Of course, to fully enjoy Dirty Grandpa you'll also need a high tolerance for stories in which a top dog continually triumphs. Grandpa thinks he's hot stuff. Grandpa is hot stuff! When not successfully flirting with bikini-clad-babes, the well-endowed and super-strong Dick bests an array of young black men  scary straight ones, plus a flouncy gay one too. These simple souls admire Dick for telling it like it is (when he uses the n-word, he receives a round of applause). Imagine wandering into one of Rod Liddle's wet dreams. Yuk. Yuk. Yuk. Dirty Grandpa  like Stand Up Guys and Last Vegas  is a viagra film, part of a genre designed to flatter ageing men. Although John Phillips's script insults even this demographic. When Dick goes to visit one-time colleague Stinky (Danny Glover) he's horrified to discover that Stinky is in a wheelchair, dying. We never see the character again. He's infirm and therefore, according to the film, not worth the time of day. Dirty Grandpa is, on top of every thing else, ageist. Its horrible message: the old are only interesting when they're capable of aping the young. Those of us grieving for the career of Robert De Niro have (while tolerating the odd decent cameo in a David O Russell flick) stopped wishing for any sort of late-career masterpiece. He has been appearing in appalling films for much longer than he appeared in classics. Robert De Niro is an actor in bad films.That's what he does. Yes, he may have once dallied with quality cinema. Ronnie Kray did a few paintings in prison. That didn't make him Willem de Kooning. The most we can hope for is, perhaps, that De Niro now appears in a film so revoltingly cankerous that it poisons the creative bloodstream and shocks him back into relative sense.Where were we? Oh Jesus. Dirty Grandpa. I'd almost managed to convince myself it didn't exist. Despite what you may have heard, the film isn't quite bad enough to meet the criterion above. Indeed, thanks to Ride Along 2, it doesn't even register as the worst American comedy released this month. It is, by the debased standards of 21st century De Niro, only ordinarily terrible.The likable Zac Efron plays a young lawyer tentatively looking forward to marrying an archetypal Bridezilla. A week before the ""rehearsal brunch"", he attends his grandmother's funeral and is persuaded to drive her widower"

So here's hoping that the January release of ""Dirty Grandpa"" doesn't prevent critics from remembering the film when they make up their Worst Movies of 2016 lists, because it is truly deserving.The film seems designed to see just how much further degradation Robert De Niro's legacy can take, and at this point, the actor might be as well known for his late-career backslide into increasingly distressing dreck as he is for his indelible, influential work of the 1970s and '80s. The funny thing is that he seems to be perfectly happy to do it.In ""Dirty Grandpa,"" it appears that screenwriter John Phillips opened Final Draft and typed as many expletives, words for genitalia and gross, unfunny brand-based puns as he could think of  several dozen times. With set pieces recycled from old episodes of ""MTV's Spring Break"" and the running themes of masculinity panic, homophobia, racial stereotypes and casual references to sexual assault (these couldn't, in fairness, be described as ""jokes""), there you have ""Dirty Grandpa."" The plot follows Richard (De Niro) as he hijacks his uptight grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to Daytona Beach, Fla., so he can party after his wife's death and talk Jason out of marrying the shrill Meredith (Julianne Hough). It goes without saying that the film is offensive, playing fast and loose with taboos such as the N-word, anti-Semitism, prison rape and child molestation, not to mention the treatment of women as mere orifices. But none of this is rendered in a particularly funny or novel way  just crude, shocking statements. Therefore, the film isn't actually offensive because it's trying so hard to be and failing miserably.Much of ""Dirty Grandpa'""s ire is directed at white males. Richard and everyone else constantly shame Jason for his slick, metrosexual/corporate lawyer life, with a continual gag referring to him as a ""lesbian."" Efron submits gamely to the debasement, which often results in his nudity or an emasculating wardrobe.Directed by Dan Mazer, the filmmaking is sloppy. Most of the scenes make little sense. Day is suddenly night, photos appear on a camera mysteriously, characters contradict themselves. Punchlines don't land, and there's an overreliance on the trope of slow-motion walking to a cool song. And even that's not well executed.Bright spots are found in the supporting cast, though the less said about Aubrey Plaza's bizarre portrayal of horny, grandpa-fetishizing Lenore, the better. Hough is legitimately great as the marriage-obsessed control freak Meredith, a sort of female equivalent to the character played by Bradley Cooper in ""Wedding Crashers."" Adam Pally is an always welcome presence. They just are not enough to pull ""Dirty Grandpa"" out of its ill-conceived and poorly executed gutter. Stay home and watch Harmony Korine's ""Spring Breakers"" instead."
164,KDO_Doc4_Dirty_Grandpa,KDO_Doc4_Dirty_Grandpa,KDO,Comedy,Negative,Dirty_Grandpa,"Robert De Niro hits an all-time low alongside Zac Efron in this insufferable road trip comedy.In our review of last year's misguided Al Pacino vehicle, Danny Collins, we facetiously suggested that perhaps the reason its star and his equally-regarded contemporary, Robert De Niro, were churning out such consistent levels of dreck in recent years was the result of an inside joke between the two  a competition to see who could make the worst film. In whichever parallel universe such audience-trolling japery might exist, the release of Dirty Grandpa sees the contest unequivocally closed, a champion crowned.If there's a single positive to be taken away for those lamenting the post-millennial downward trajectory of De Niro's career choices, it's the knowledge that Dirty Grandpa represents rock bottom (sub-stratum, even) and that the next film we see him in will be  can only be  better.For now though, this is what we've got: an insidiously misanthropic road-trip yarn, steeped in vile dudebro privilege masquerading as equal-opportunity offensiveness. Not a single character (or actor) escapes with a shred of dignity intact, as an alternately bored or bewildered Zac Efron accompanies his recently bereaved gramps on a skirt-chasing trip to Florida.With Efron playing the straight-man to De Niro's horny old toad, he's more often than not the butt of the 'jokes'  quite literally in a running gag that sees a grandfather stick his thumb up his grandson's arse at every given opportunity.The road trip itself begins with an extended shot of De Niro masturbating, continuing a strangely recurrent trope within the actor's comedies. What's the obsession filmmakers have with De Niro's junk? The Intern, The Big Wedding, Little Fockers  even 1900  all feature sequences that zero-in on his hard-on. Perhaps it's contractual? A last stand of virility as his more celebrated talents visibly deflate; his very own phallocentric Alamo?Yet it's difficult to feel too much sympathy for cinema's foremost Archbishop of Peru (see 2004's The Bridge of San Luis Rey  actually, don't), given the vile dialogue he's made to spout. Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman's Bradley finds himself on the receiving end of one of De Niro's most repellent attacks: being black and gay apparently a gag in and of itself. Not that it's any better for the film's female characters, alternately reduced to sexpots (poor Aubrey Plaza), harridans or chaste, would-be girlfriends. A karaoke set-piece constructed entirely around De Niro dropping the n-bomb forms an echo chamber of bad judgement around all involved.Dan Mazer directs like a man in constant negotiation with an intemperate black hole, locking horns in a Sisyphean battle against a nation's entire tumbleweed stock; those inanimate De Niro-comedy groupies that tumble far to have their existential cries of purpose definitively answered. He's a long way from the smart satire of Borat, or the throwaway charms of I Give It A Year.

There's no reason, inherently, that a movie called Dirty Grandpa, even one starring one of the greatest actors of our time, has to be bad. The idea that a comedy is supposed to have taste, that certain jokes should be beneath us, is wrong-headed and dismissive; all that is required of a joke is that it be funny. There is a way, in a theoretical universe, that a scene where Robert DeNiro masturbates on his couch while watching amateur porn involving elderly people could be funny. I don't know where this theoretical universe is, and I suspect I wouldn't want to live there, but it could exist. It requires set up, and dedication to the joke, and a cheerful willingness to take every comedic scenario to its logical extreme. It requires more than a half second of thought. Nothing in Dirty Grandpa appears to have been thought out any further than ""what's the grossest thing we can have Robert DeNiro say right now?"" It is depressing, sure, but not because of the style; it's all about the execution. I'm probably kidding myself that Robert DeNiro sticking his penis in the face of a sleeping Zac Efron is ever a joke that could be executed properly. It's a joke that should probably be executed in the public square. The plot of Dirty Grandpa is so thin that it appears to have been written on note cards that were thrown at the actors as they walked though each particular scene. DeNiro plays Dick Kelly, whose wife dies when the film begins; he requests that his grandson Jason (Efron) drive him from Georgia to Florida, for reasons I frankly don't remember and do not care to. Turns out, Grandpa just wants to get to Daytona Beach so he can have a lot of sex and take a lot of drugs. No real reason is given for this other than ""it'll be funny to watch Robert DeNiro take a lot of drugs and curse and toss around millennial slang."" And let me tell you, reader, that is an awfully bad reason. Along the way, they come across a couple of spring breakers (Zoey Deutchthe daughter of Lea Thompson, which made me feel sort of oldand Aubrey Plaza, who I suspect initially thought she was signing up for a far different movie) and end up taking a lot of bong hits with their shirts off while drawing penises on each other's faces. I could go on with the plot summary here, but why put us both through that? Where do I start here? DeNiro's Dick Kelly isn't a character so much as a constant spewer of ""outrageousness,"" the outlet of the screenwriters' desperate desire to offend everyone possible in the least inventive way.

With its no-holds-barred approach to comedy and the two leads great on-screen rapport, director Dan Mazer is able to offer up the perfect R-rated antidote to our cold and gloomy January's. Just don't expect anything that intellectually ground-breaking or moving...The film follows uptight and by-the-book, young lawyer Jason Kelly (Efron) who works at his stuffy father's film and is set to marry his over-bearing fiancEe Meredith (Julianne Hough) in just over a week. Seeing that his grandson is soon to enter into a life of constant ""sleepwalking"" and being told what to do, Dick (De Niro) guilt-trips Jason into driving him to Florida for his annual holiday, in a last-ditch attempt to make Jason see sense and break free from his oppressed situation. His argument? That his late wife, and Jason's grandmother, would have wanted him to have kept up the tradition.However, Jason soon releases that his grandfather isn't the sweet, grieving man that he expected him to be, and is actually a foul-mouthed old guy who feels like he's missed out on the best years of his life and dreams of the day he can have some fun in the sack with well, anyone, to make up for lost time. Don't get it twisted though, Dick has some redeeming qualities. His sense of family is very much still intact and he remained completely faithful to his wife up until her final days. As if that's something we should praise him hero for, but heck, it kind of does make him a little endearing.During a pit stop on their travels, the pair run into Jason's old college friend Shadia (Zoey Deutch), who just so happened to be on his photography course n a subject he was very passionate about before he got unintentionally whisked away into the world of law. Shadia's accompanied by her friends: loose, sarcastic Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) who makes a sexual beeline for Dick, and their African-American gay friend Bradley, who swiftly becomes the butt of Dick's questionable teasing. The subjects of his barrage of mockery, we will let you assume. Lenore invites them to Daytona Beach to party and again, Dick convinces Jason to go along, and that's when the film finally picks up momentum and as expected spewing at chugging contests, public Flex-Off's, accidental drug-taking and nights in jail ensue... as you do. With Dirty Grandpa, absolutely anything goes when it comes to the opportunity of owning a gag, which is unsurprising given that it was directed by Borat writer Dan Mazer. A lot of the time, it's actually quite shocking how far both the script and the actors will take the joke, whether it be the up-close shot of a certain part of De Niro we can only hope is a prosthetic, a rapping Dick asking his new ""crew"" whether he can say the ""n-word"" or an awkwardly"

By the time Iim seeing the movies in the mid-January slate, Iim done with award films, having been watching them for the past three months in order to vote in various groups.So, when I start seeing the January movies (or at least the ones the studio has the stones to show us critics ahead of time), I actually am primed to enjoy them a little more. By this time of the year, Iim tired of significant movies showing peopleis impossible struggles over adversity. Iim ready for raunchy comedies and substandard horror flicks.In this context, a movie like iDirty Grandpai appeals to me more than it would were it released in a later timeframe. I know that iDirty Grandpai has nothing in it that is redeeming, honorable or respectable. Itis a low-brow comedy that is going for cheap laughs. And while cheap laughs are worth what you pay for them, I actually enjoy some of them quite a bit.Iive said it before, and Iill say it again: Iim a pig. Itis okay to be a pig now and again.More over, iDirty Grandpai has done nothing to hide its true nature. No one should be blindsided by this movieis premise or delivery. Itis all out there in the trailers and the posters. You shouldnit be expecting a tender characters study between grandson and grandfather. Instead, you should be expecting a ribald comedy in which Robert De Niro sticks his junk against Zac Efronis face while theyire sleeping.About a month ago, iSistersi opened as counter-programming against iStar Wars: The Force Awakens.i Though it was dwarfed by the latter in the box office, iSistersi did well enough, and it went for similar low-brow laughs. At its heart, iSistersi was an all-night house party movie with the twist of being about women in their 40s.Similarly, iDirty Grandpai is a spring break road trip movie with a guy who cashes a social security check every month. The story follows Jason (Zac Efron), an uptight lawyer, whose recently-widowed grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) convinces him to drive him to Florida on the eve of his weeding. Soon, we learn Dickis real plan is to show Jason a good time in order to stop him from marrying his stuck-up, snobby fiancEe (Julianne Hough).Not everything in this movie is funny, and the set-up takes a bit too long to play out. However, there are some moments that made me laugh, Iill admit. I enjoyed seeing De Niro play a different version of the foul-mouthed hothead (as opposed to the oodles of gangsters heis played over the years).I know there are plenty of people out there bemoaning De Nirois acting choices lately, but I have respect for the guy still having fun in front of the camera and taking some bolder choices.

There they meet a male drug dealer named Pamela (Jason Mantzoukas) who introduces Jason to crack cocaine, get thrown in jail, compete in a bodybuilding contest and much more.Of course Dick's unorthodox behaviour is ripe with life lessons... you just have to endure 60 minutes of pedophilia, masturbation and rape gags before those lessons become apparent.""Dirty Grandpa"" is credited to one writer but feels like it was penned by a group of drunken frat boys on the beer and bourbon binge. What, I guess, is supposed to be a funny look at aging and making the most of the time we all have, is reduced to a spectacle of a once revered thespian calling his lawyer grandson ""Alan Douceowitz."" If this were a drinking game where you took a shot every time De Niro says ""vagina"" (and all of that word's derivations) or any number of other words I can't print here you'd have alcohol poisoning half an hour in. It mistakes politically incorrect ""did he really just say that"" jokes for actual humour.Then there is the presence of the great man himself. I can forgive Zac Efron's participation in ""Dirty Grandpa,"" he's young and the idea of starring with De Niro (who he imitated rather perfectly in ""Neighbors"") must have been irresistible but what is the star of ""Taxi Driver"" doing here? At one point Jason yells, ""What the 'bleep' is wrong with you?"" at him repeatedly. It's a legit question. Perhaps it's time for a career intervention. For the good of all of cinema let's get David O.

I don't understand why people are so negative or serious about it. It is clearly made to be a light, funny movie. I loved both Zac Efron and Robert De Niro in this. Absolutely loved this film. Hillarious. We shouldn't be afraid to say anything. It's a great eye opener. Funny comedy all the millennials should watch. thank God, I didn't listen to any of the bad reviews. This movie isn't gonna win an Oscar or anything but it is funny and just it's a cute movie. I bet the same people would hate some thing about Mary I just can't believe how bad all these people are saying it's the worst movie it's horrible, blah blah blah, it's a stupid comedy movie. It's crazy. I definitely didn't waste my time watching this if you want something crazy and funny it's a cute movie. on the same day I first saw it. Sure the story isn't good. The plot has a questionable morality, but screw all that. This movie is just one big profanity fest and it is hilarious and abaurd. If you like borat or Bruno, east bound and down or that type of content. This is for you. Also you should not watch this movie sober. It is the perfect stoner flick. That said, it is a relic from a long almost forgotten time where Hollywood could actually still make these movies and say the things that were said. It would be impossible to make this movie in this day and age and no one would touch it . That's why this is special. It's a dinosaur, all ready extinct, but boy does it feel good to have one more look.Extremely underrated. Seen this movie 5+ times and laugh hysterically each time. It's feel good, simple, vulgar fun, and both the leads crush their roles. Magnificent. No joke. Of course this hasn't won Oscars and quite rightly so, but if you want to feel silly for 2hrs and not take anything too seriously, this is the film. Oml this was wild!!! LOVED IT! Hella funny and ambiguous, and a pleasure to watch. Can't believe I didn't watch this earlier! Real fun to watch Hilarious laugh out loud comedy not suitable to anyone who is sensitive to a bit of bad language. Highly recommended and would watch again"

He is, nearly unquestionably, one of Hollywood's truly great actors and is such an iconic figure that it's not difficult to understand why Zac Efron, the former High School Musical star who has struggled to find anything resembling actual fame as an adult actor, would jump at the chance to share the screen with De Niro.Welcome to the world of Razzies, Bob.I'm serious. If De Niro doesn't, at minimum, snag a Razzie nomination for his enthusiastic yet dreadful work in Dirty Grandpa, an aimless and painfully unfunny cinematic hinterland of a film amateurishly directed by frequent Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator Dan Mazer and written by John Phillips, then the Razzies should finally be put to rest. I don't care how many bad films Adam Sandler puts out on Netflix, Dirty Grandpa deserves to be right alongside them.It takes both talent and intelligence to remain a Hollywood icon into your 70's, but it's hard not to wonder if Dirty Grandpa isn't De Niro's Jaws 4, the latter being a film that star Michael Caine acknowledged as being dreadful yet also a film that he's quick to acknowledge bought him a very nice house.Seriously, what did you need Bob? College tuition for the kids? A new home for the missus? The bones of an actual comedy legend like Chaplin? What was it? WHY Bob?Did you have an insatiable need to use the word ""fuck"" more times than I could count? Does your wife forbid the use of ""cock"" in the house? Is masturbating to porn a long held secret fantasy? Or are you just so grateful that you've lived past the age of 69 that you'll sign your name to anything now?Stop it. Just stop it. You're better than this, Bob. No, this isn't a film that twenty years from now will be recognized as a comedy great. Instead, it will be almost universally regarded as a cinematic aberration in career that has been for the most part quite stellar.Don't get me wrong. I understand. Heck, I'm getting older myself and these days even a really awesome bowel movement can make me giggle like a schoolboy.The story, and I use that word very loosely, involves the aptly named Dick (De Niro) convincing his grandson Jason (Efron) to drive him from Atlanta to Boca Raton following the death of his wife of four decades.Couldn't he have just hitched a ride with Kevin Hart and Ice Cube?Jason is a straight-laced lawyer a week away from marrying his boss's ultra-controlling daughter (Julianne Hough) and gaining the fast-track to partnership with the firm. Of course, we know within seconds that he's damn well going to go and the two are off in his soon-to-be wife's pink car for adventures that are crying out for a decent director to direct them.While I've been picking on De Niro, that's what you get when you're the star, the truth"

I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have actually seen Minority Report, as I just have, because I have to say that is one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while.The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience firmly in the middle of the 21st century. Personally I can absolutely believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in the film within 50 years. Just look back 50 years into the past and you should be able to see why. The lives of everyday people in the film, where they are scanned and advertised 'at' all day every day, apart from an excuse for product placement (and why not?), certainly make you think about a world where 'they' know your every move (a future towards which we are already hurtling with some speed).The style is amazing - why the wooden balls? Because they're cool is why. I like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around. The plastic, chrome and glass sets, objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette. The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen in a film. I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays look like Macs? Surely a touch unrealistic ;) The story is amazing - complicated, yes, but also engrossing, exciting and scary. There are elements here that are only hinted at, but which give the plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks. And it asks the kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society that'll keep you thinking for much longer that the film's two and some hours. The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured, as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course, numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. I hope it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg.Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual, but the discovery of this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha. Who saw the film and didn't share her terror and vulnerability? Little touches such as the way she clings to Cruise, almost like a baby's reflex, make her a character you immediately care about, innocent and tragic.Anyway, if that's not enough to recommend the film, then you'll probably never find another one you like again.

172,MVV_Doc2_Minority_Report,MVV_Doc2_Minority_Report,MVV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"At a time when movies think they have to choose between action and ideas, Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" is a triumph--a film that works on our minds and our emotions. It is a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit. Here is a master filmmaker at the top of his form, working with a star, Tom Cruise, who generates complex human feelings even while playing an action hero. I complained earlier this summer of awkward joins between live action and CGI; I felt the action sequences in ""Spider-Man"" looked too cartoonish, and that ""Star Wars Episode II,"" by using computer effects to separate the human actors from the sets and CGI characters, felt disconnected and sterile. Now here is Spielberg using every trick in the book and matching them without seams, so that no matter how he's achieving his effects, the focus is always on the story and the characters. The movie turns out to be eerily prescient, using the term ""pre-crime"" to describe stopping crimes before they happen; how could Spielberg have known the government would be using the same term this summer? In his film, inspired by but much expanded from a short story by Philip K. Dick, Tom Cruise is John Anderton, chief of the Department of Pre-Crime in the District of Columbia, where there has not been a murder in six years. Soon, it appears, there will be a murder--committed by Anderton himself. The year is 2054. Futuristic skyscrapers coexist with the famous Washington monuments and houses from the 19th century. Anderton presides over an operation controlling three ""Pre-Cogs,"" precognitive humans who drift in a flotation tank, their brain waves tapped by computers. They're able to pick up thoughts of premeditated murders and warn the cops, who swoop down and arrest the would-be perpetrators before the killings can take place. Because this is Washington, any government operation that is high-profile and successful inspires jealousy. Anderton's superior, bureau director Burgess (Max von Sydow) takes pride in him, and shields him from bureaucrats like Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), from the Justice Department. As the pre-crime strategy prepares to go national, Witwer seems to have doubts about its wisdom--or he is only jealous of its success? Spielberg establishes these characters in a dazzling future world, created by art director Alex McDowell, that is so filled with details large and small that we stop trying to figure out everything and surrender with a sigh. Some of the details: a computer interface that floats in mid-air, manipulated by Cruise with the gestures of a symphony conductor; advertisements that crawl up the sides of walls and address you personally; cars that whisk around town on magnetic cushions; robotic ""spiders"" that can search a building in minutes by performing a retinal scan on everyone in it. ""Blade Runner,"" also inspired by a Dick story, shows a future world in decay; ""Minority Report"" offers a more optimistic preview.The plot centers on a rare glitch in the visions of"

Roger Ebert, in particular, had an absolutely gushing review, in which he praised the film for being ""a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit."" Ebert is by all accounts a lovely human being, but every time I read something by him, I am reminded that he does not have the critical sense that God gave a roach. Even an insect that frolics in filth would be hard pressed to find any enjoyment in such a shiny, treacly, turkey of a film. Spielberg as director has found perhaps the perfect outlet for his glibness in this tale of precognitive saviors. The film grinds frictionlessly along, a remorselessly predictable blueprint for itself. Flawed hero, tragic backstory, clever chase scene, cleverer chase scene, cleverest chase scene, false antagonist, twist, real antagonist, reconciliation with perfectly domestic yet also spunky wife. Like the precogs, we can see it all coming and all going too; painful echoes of sentiment past sliding down our brainstems as we float weightlessly in an infinite vat of sentimental horseshit.The emotional core of the film is (you could predict it) the tragic backstory I mentioned. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a efficient no-nonsense police guy in the precrime unit, snooping out murders before they happen. Beneath his gruff exterior and Hollywood good looks, though, lurks a sadness; his 5-year old disappeared from a public pool. Anderton's marriage collapsed, and now he takes drugs (ooooh...dark) and watches 3-D home movies of his son and wife. His heart is tugged while watching them and our heart is tugged while watching him; it's a testament to the power of film and to ""complex human feelings"", in Ebert's words.Said complex human feelings being: hey, losing a kid  that really sucks. If that happens to you, you've got to be deep, right? That is the extent of the film's character development; Anderton has no other discernible personality traits; nor does his wife. The film's stupid, by-the-numbers plot, it's utterly facile and familiar characters, are all supposed to be redeemed by dropping a murdered five-year old onto them from a great height.Before I had a kid myself, I found this sort of mindless, self-serving manipulation unpleasant. Now that I have a child of my own, who is actually a person rather than a trope, I find it even more detestable. At the end of the film, Anderton indignantly yells at his stupid standard-issue corrupt boss for manipulating his love for his child. Rarely have I seen a moment of such utterly clueless hypocrisy. The whole film is nothing but a giant machine designed to turn unearned pathos into critical bona fides. The closing scene with Anderton, where reunited with his now pregnant wife he touches her stomach, is a blindingly offensive capstone to a thoroughly offensive film, a smug reassuring happy-ending which"

I prize this particular issue not for anything inside but for the cover illustration by ""Emsh,"" the name future filmmaker Ed Emshwiller used to sign his artwork. In the foreground two transparent handsone revealing human bones, the other metal onesare shown in front of the vast reaches of an enclosed cityscape with pedestrians. This encouraged me to consider not only a future city but also how it might look to both a human and a robot detective.No story, by Asimov or anyone else, could do as much for my imagination as that Emsh cover. The only thing that came close was a single sentence by Damon Knight in his review of Asimov's novel, which may have been what led me to the novel and that issue of Galaxy in the first place: ""Asimov has turned a clear, ironic, and compassionate eye on every cranny of the City: the games children play on the moving streets; the legends that have grown up about deserted corridors; the customs and taboos in Section kitchens and men's rooms; the very feel, smell, and texture of those steel caves in which men live and die."" This helped me imagine a future city, though unlike the Emsh cover or A.I. Artificial Intelligence, it taught me nothing about what it might be like to be a robot. I became an SF fan because of such invitations to dream about the future, immense spaces, and one's own origins. Early SF movies like Metropolis (1926) offered all these invitations, and their poetics were later elaborated on by films such as Blade Runner (1982), which borrowed from other diverse sources, including neonoir and Shanghai Express. Less poetic evocations of otherworldly climes, like the original Star Wars, can also create some of this magicprovided their visions are fleeting, on-screen just long enough to tease the imagination; as in soft-core-porn bubble dances, the secret is not to show too much. (The Emsh Galaxy cover may show a lot of one cityscape, but it only suggests a narrative, leaving that mainly to the viewer.) The parallel with porn is more apparent when one reflects that most futuristic, gadget-ridden science fiction is selling something that has more to do with the present than the future: ""investing in the future"" is mostly about buying now, and the hype about ""experiencing the future"" through the latest technology is an invitation to dig into our pockets today. Maybe that's why most SF veers more toward the right than the leftbecause it's usually selling not the fancy trappings but the status quo.Minority Report, Steven Spielberg's enjoyable new thriller set in Washington, D.C., in 2054full of more alluring gadgets than you can shake a stick atperforms its own bubble dance, for good and ill.

175,MVV_Doc5_Minority_Report,MVV_Doc5_Minority_Report,MVV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick's science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg's complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick's 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author's vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg's most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick's obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author's ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick's work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity's evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg's film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick's vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker.Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C.'s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the ""gifts"" of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs' foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn't been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton's personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorce, he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer's insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit a"

In the year 2054 murder has been eliminated in Washington DC through the use of a team of psychics who infallibly foresee killings. The would-be murderers are apprehended before they commit their crimes and sent to cryogenic freezing units. When the leading figure in the ""Pre-Crime Unit,"" John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is named as the future killer of a man he does not know, he sets out to unravel the mystery, with his own police force hot on his trail. Anderton's own son was abducted and presumably murdered some years before, an event that also shattered his marriage. Spielberg is one of the more gifted members of a generation of studio filmmakers whose output in general has been exceedingly poor and forgettable. He has the undoubted ability to narrate a drama effectively, to hold the spectator's attention and to develop a theme. His themes, however, tend to revolve around the concerns of his generation of upper middle class Americans. It is surely notable that in a filmmaking career spanning thirty tumultuous years, Spielberg, whose personal wealth reportedly exceeds $2 billion, has not once weighed in tellingly on the state of American society. Minority Report, based on a 1956 short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, has intriguing and entertaining elements. No expense has been spared. The filmmakers have thought up all manner of ingenious devices, combining the retrograde and the futuristic, to create the world of 2054. However, as is nearly always the case in contemporary science fiction, the imagination has only been set to work on ""things,"" not relations between people, not social life. There are absurdities in Minority Report which reveal a great deal about the social assumptions and prejudices of its creators. The American society of half a century from now is presented as generally prosperous and content, insofar as one is able to determine, but crime and murder (and drug use) persist. Why? Is there no connection between poverty and violent behavior, or, more generally, between social reality and crime? The filmmakers are either adapting to themselves to the right-wing argument that crime is essentially causeless (rooted in Man's fallen state) or, probably more to the point, indicating their lack of interest in its causes and a concern merely with the means of avoiding its consequences. The discovery that the psychics do not always agree, that there are suppressed ""minority reports,"" suggesting other possible outcomes, is the turning point in Spielberg's film. The Pre-Crime Unit may, in fact, be seizing and incarcerating those who were never going to commit any offenses. Anderton finds out for himself the complex relationship between the apparently inevitable and the actual manner in which events play themselves out. One can only respond: thank heavens for small mercies. Steven Spielberg and company do not, in the end, come down on the side of preemptively locking up everyone who is a potential criminal. A great day for democracy indeed! It was"

It's a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in ""red ball"" situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion  since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy  and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog  the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy  one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated ""Blade Runner"" setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens  an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of ""Minority Report,"" which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism. And indeed, while the story is superbly complex, twisting and turning"
178,MVV_Doc8_Minority_Report,MVV_Doc8_Minority_Report,MVV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"OVER THE past twenty years, the works of Philip K. Dick have become the hottest sf based-upons in Hollywood. Many have speculated on the reason. True believers think it's the cosmic inevitability of PKD's epistemological genius, which has the power to reach even the soul-dead executives of the major studios. (But these folks are, conversely, so outraged by how the holy writ has been distorted and defiled by movie makers that they wish the current and planned screen adaptations would just go away.) Others simply see the late great author's themes as highly relevant, and then some. Dickian ""paranoia"" about corporate and government iniquity certainly speaks even more eloquently to a society faced with a steady stream of news stories about Enrons, Halliburtons, and the frightening examples of governmental surveillance and detentions that have occurred since 9-11 and the passage of the PATRIOT Act. But Philip K. Dick isn't the only sf author to explore such issues. Nor is he the only author to ruminate on the nature of reality and humanity. As talented and timely a writer as Mr. Dick is, his Hollywood hot property status probably has less to do with him or his literary executors than it does with a gentleman named Ridley Scott. The film industry leeches on literature, it's true. But it absolutely feasts upon itself. Blade Runner (1982), a screenplay by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, based upon PKD's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, was directed with such style and verve by Scott that Hollywood took notice. That, despite the fact that the film did less than booming box office when it was first released. The full screen potential of science fiction could not be denied after Blade Runner (and Scott's previous space creature feature, Alien). Visual flair, philosophical substance, and kick-ass action can come together to make an entertaining and artistically compelling movie. Blade Runner proved that. Unfortunately, although major and minor studios as well as independent and international filmmakers have gone back to the well of Dickian fact and fiction again and again since 1982, none of the resulting films have equaled Scott's influential masterwork. But that doesn't keep them from trying. Steven Spielberg's Minority Report (2002) is the most recent high-profile entry. It's a handsome filmcertainly better than A.I.but ultimately rather tedious and falsely sentimental, as Spielberg films have a tendency to be. And now we have another PKD adaptation. A much, much different film that, while not a complete offense against the viewing public, manages to lose the wonder of its Dickian story in the pyrotechnics of conventional filmmaking. Paycheck, based on the 1953 Dick short story by the same name, features a screenplay by Dean Georgaris. And the adaptation isn't half bad. In some wayssacrilege alert to all PKD devoteesit actually improves on the source material. My own feeling about Dick's original ""Paycheck"" is that it presents a dandy story concept but that the narrative collapses at the end. The basic conceit, as most of you probably remember,"

The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter. There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be"

Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers. Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities. Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future. As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!"" Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication"

The acting is great, the visuals are spectacular and the story is gripping. The idea is admittedly better than the execution, but there's far more to like than to gripe about in this one. From the beginning, it's clear that Oblivion is going to be fun to watch. The concept design of the spaceships and other technology is just cool. I never got tired of watching that bubble ship do its backflip take off. And the robots blend into the world, they don't look like CGI intrusions. For a science fiction blockbuster, this is a must, and Oblivion delivers. Part of that reason is due to the performances of the actors, particularly Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough. Their chemistry is believable, and by that I mean that it doesn't seem quite natural. And unnatural is exactly what this movie needs. Cruise, the consummate movie star, uses that charisma to make us root for his daring character. And Riseborough lets just enough discontent to seethe through the surface to make us wary. Together, the strain is felt, even if you can't put your finger on it, leading to a nice payoff later in the film. The biggest plus for this movie is the idea itself. Evil computers, clones, drones and aliens combine for a sci-fi flick that doesn't give itself away too soon. Without getting too much into the details, it should be said that the twists pay off when they need to. The mark of a good twist is the ability to see it coming upon a second or third viewing, even if you missed it the first time, and Oblivion does just that. And the scenes at the lake, which could have stopped the movie dead instead provide the appropriate contrast to the cold flight control tower. Science fiction fans will be pleased, and perhaps be a bit more forgiving of some of the movie's problems. While the story is good, the telling needed a little work. Oblivion is a little busy at times. It would have benefited from a smaller scale at least as far as the cast is concerned. Which is odd, considering the cast is pretty small to begin with. Certain characters and events might have served better by reducing the scope. And the opening narration becomes redundant at one point, making me wonder if Oblivion might have been more suspenseful if the viewers had been dropped in with less exposition. And while Cruise and Riseborough were outstanding, along with Melissa Leo in a small but important role, the love story between the protagonist, Jack Harper, and his wife played by Olya Kurylenko felt a little stiff. Compared with the subtle freakiness of the movie, those scenes make you check your watch. But as I said, there is far more to like in Oblivion than to hate. It's a lot of fun with"

You wonder if an original blockbuster-type movie will ever be made with genuine effort and a non-ironic purpose, especially in the sci-fi genre. You fear the day will never come. It is nice to be proven wrong. Oblivion is not a fantastic movie by any means. It has its problems. There are some inconsistencies and goofs here and there, but you can tell from the first few minutes that genuine thought and effort was put in to this movie, and that more than makes up for its other issues. There is a style and an atmosphere to it. In a time when green-screen rooms are substituted for real sets so often that you begin to worry for the livelihoods of studio carpenters, here is a film which ""feels"" real. These are sets and locations that, though parts of them were C.G., there was a seamless blending with the real that is a treat for computer weary eyes. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician responsible for the maintenance and security of huge reactors that supply power to off-world colonists. Earth has been nearly destroyed by an invading alien force and, though humanity won the war, the planet is a wasteland. This is explained by a helpful (if annoying) voice over/scroll at the beginning of the film. Jack's only company is his communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) with whom he occasionally gets frisky. Their memories are periodically erased to protect vital off-world information in case of capture by the remnants of the alien force which they call ""Scavs"". In spite of their memory wipes Jack has flashes of his life from before the war, which worries him because the war ended sixty years ago, well before he was born. His companion tells him to focus on his work and not to worry. After all, they are leaving for the new colony in two weeks and they don't want to ruin their chance to rejoin humanity. The work continues as usual until an encounter with the Scavs and the discovery of a crashed spaceship shake everything Jack thinks he knows. From here we would enter into spoiler territory, so I will dispense with the exposition. Suffice it to say that what follows, while not perfect, at least shows true effort at the writing, acting, directing, and effects levels. The actors really care about what they are doing and it shows. Tom Cruise, of course, can only play Tom Cruise. His range is limited, but here it is well used. The mystery of the plot, while a little predictable, at least doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. In a limited fashion the movie brings up questions about what it means to be human and what our purpose really is in the world. Though these issues are not delved into too deeply, it was nice to see them actually dealt with and not just used as cheap set pieces. The"

The experience leaves you breathless and lost for words, and jaw dropped almost immediately the moment it starts. Well that's me with Oblivion, Tron Legacy director Joseph Kosinski has created the most immersive, stunning and vivid world ravaged by war, and it's populated with gripping characters and knockout action sequences. Tom Cruise is Jack Harper, a Drone repairmen and one of the last men on earth, alongside is Victoria, his computer specialist, who monitors the Drone activity. On a routine zone check Harper discovers a downed vessel, in the wreckage lies Julia Rusakova, a woman that holds a key to his past, and she causes him to question everything he knows about himself and his mission. I love how the story unfolds, showing Jack's normal day tasks and his relationship with Victoria, but as soon as Julia is involved his past comes back to him, events progress and twists and turns are thrown at you from all directions and they shock. There are a lot of lump-in-your-throat scenes that hit hard, mainly in the last thirty minutes. The world of Oblivion looks so real, famous landmarks have fallen and nature has taken over. Whilst it all looks ruined there is a beauty to it, the Superbowl stadium looks incredible as does the destroyed Moon which fills the sky. The Bubble-ship is a stunning piece of craft, I saw the making of the Ship and the way it's been implemented into the film which is wonderful. Tower 49 is visually remarkable and the characters feel melded to the set, it's as if Apple have had a huge input into the films set design! It's a striking movie that is just beautiful, the skies are sun-scorched and it's a sight to behold. The sound design is near perfect too, the sound of the Drone's beeping and scanning is atmospheric and sinister, especially in the abandoned library scene. I think this is Tom Cruise' best performance in years, he's not playing his usual cool and tough guy, Harper is attached to the world he lives in and wants to stay, but Victoria dreams of leaving and going to the tet, a vast and giant tetrahedral space station that orbits Earth. Andrea Riseborough is wonderful, you can just tell how committed she is to the script and how much fun she is having, it's great seeing strong British talent working opposite a Hollywood megastar! I absolutely love Olga Kurylenko, she still remains my favourite Bond girl and I've seen her in numerous other roles and she is spectacular, but in Oblivion she brings her A-game as every scene she is in there's hard hitting emotion, plus her character is most interesting as she holds the real secret behind Harper's past and the world around him. It's a near perfect movie in my opinion. No movie can be perfect but it can get to the point where"

A Sci-fi invasion that doesn't feature massive alien vessels or fleets, trashing America directly (as it is already trashed, saving us the unnecessary drama) and one which has a realistic reason for the alien to visit earth - simply fuel. Why do we always feel that aliens with advanced tech and the ability to travel between stars, would actually be interested in us and would need to build a huge fleet of craft and then stupidly enter our atmosphere. In this film, they previously arrived, analysed, took a bit of time and removed everything in the way of obtaining what they required then used what was available to hand whilst staying out of the way (I use 'they' and 'aliens' so as not to 'spoiler' anything too much). The film is well written, has a perfect pace and an awesome soundtrack. Everything about this film is testament to sticking to your guns as a director and not 'dumbing it down' or 'actioning it up' to appeal to the masses. Best Sci-fi this year, or in fact since District 9. This will be a cult film one day in the likes of Kubrick, it is just a shame that no one currently seems to understand it properly. The final scenes and the point we start to watch the film can theoretically be untold generations before and after the moon 'event' respectively. Both seem to be missed by many. It is also a pity that no one seems to understand that the earth is buried in moon dust, and has also been through several wars/logistics preparations prior to the harvesting phase we start the film in. Sure, WE used a few nukes at some point but the most damage was done by the 'aliens' taking out the moon. The empire state is not the only building left standing - its the only building still poking out of the moon dust and rubble. If you look closely you will see that the streets of New York are now essentially no more than river canyons - most buildings are still standing they are just buried. If you 'get' the adaptive nature of the 'aliens' approach over an indeterminate amount of time, then you will understand the almost relaxed attitude of the story which is in fact meant as a homage to the aliens final hurrah. It is a shame it isn't reviewed more often by those who like films that require an IQ over 80 and like to ponder over things every time they watch it. Of course you can draw a likeness to 'moon' or 'the matrix' but unlike both, it isn't easy to solve in 10 minutes. These days there are not many films that offer more each and every time you view them even when you think you know the twist.

185,PYZ_Doc5_Oblivion,PYZ_Doc5_Oblivion,PYZ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Oblivion begins with a lengthy voiceover (delivered to whom?) explaining, in absurd detail, the background to the latest cinematic apocalypse. If they are allowed to swell screen time with tedious exposition, then I am allowed to flesh out this review in the same way. It goes like this. At some point in the late 21st century, a horde of aliens descended upon the earth and launched an unholy war against its human occupants. Eventually, after launching a series of nuclear strikes, the homo sapiens triumphed, but the planet was left a virtual wasteland. The surviving citizens then retired to a vast, geometrically eccentric structure and began preparing for an exodus to the largest of Saturn's moons. (Hang on! Titan is more hospitable than a mildly exploded Earth? How does that work?) In the movie's present, poor Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a former marine, is saddled with the task of repairing drones that prowl the planet seeking out rogue aliens. Got that? Now the film can begin. Joseph Kosinski, director of the unlovely Tron: Legacy, doesn't expose too much new ground here. The looming, often unhelpful influence of Stanley Kubrick shows itself in the gleaming, pristine surfaces and taste for icy non-characterisation. The action sequences that colonise the last half-hour prove how hard it is to escape from the shadow of Star Wars . Tom Cruise remains the same Tom Cruise that Tom Cruise has always been. Still, it can't be denied that the opening sections are beautifully carried off. Jack lives in a futuristic pastiche of bourgeois domesticity that  one more reference if you'll allow  conjures up memories of the cartoon show The Jetsons . As Victoria, Jack's professional and romantic partner, poor Andrea Riseborough is asked to dress as if she's constantly on her way to the Oscars ceremony. Bad news, women: in the future, punishing high-heels will, it seems, be part of everyday work-wear again. As futurology it stinks. But as anaesthetised fantasy it works very nicely: the walls are all iPod white; the swimming pool sparkles beautifully; the view from the outside is ripped from a vintage science-fiction paperback cover. This life is so monotonously perfect you know it must be some sort of sham. Sure enough, one day Jack happens upon a downed spaceship, plucks a woman (spirited Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage and brings her home to Happy Towers. The facade begins to slip. At first, the interactions between Victoria and her new guest  hostility is much on display  point us towards a misogynistic reading of female relations. But, as further disturbing truths are revealed, it becomes clear that there are ancient reasons for the friction. Play close attention to the trailer and you will get some surprisingly explicit pointers towards the eventual twist. Not altogether mind-numbing, the reversal eventually propels us, as you knew it would, towards a great many shots of hurtling spacecraft. To be fair, Kosinki, working from his own unpublished graphic novel, uses the revelations to make"
186,PYZ_Doc6_Oblivion,PYZ_Doc6_Oblivion,PYZ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Primarily a tale of disinformation, ""Oblivion"" tackles myriad issues that are relevant to our time: Do you know who you are? Who do you trust to inform you? What is true intimacy? And will Artificial Intelligence rule over mankind? To be frank, the true great villain in ""Oblivion"" is the human race itself: We are enslaving our own people, destroying our own planet and exterminating each other. But, to be even more precise, the true villains are the people in wealth and power (as portrayed here by sentient artificial intelligence). The millionaires and politicians are the ones who pay to keep us in the dark and on our hamster wheels, feeding them resources at the cost of all life on the surface of the Earth. In our reality, just like in the movie, mankind is engaged in repetitive tasks, staying alive and oblivious to its truth; living in superficial relationships with no real love and allowing the planet to be consumed. As such, you and I ARE the protagonist in this movie: A puppet on strings, fighting against itself and serving an evil, selfish and vampiric power that is corrupting the planet. We are living in the clouds and need to touch grass. To get the plastic point across, Director Joseph Kosinski employs wonderful vistas of our planet. The photography and prop design in this movie is truly something special (thank you, Claudio Miranda). The color palette also gets the plot across by driving in the difference between conscious and unconscious, earthly and artificial thru black, brown and green versus cream and grey. Thru an exaggerated script, (one which can be frustrating, especially during the first minutes of the film), we see that the ideal life our repairman leads is both luxurious and supposedly meaningful... but something is afoot; it doesn't feel natural! Our protagonist has been fed false information, the same way we are told whatever suits the agenda of today's media outlets. We notice in the movie that those who cannot accept the truth, refuse to engage with the planet; they live in the sky and are not ""down to Earth"". These people exist in real life, and can usually be found in wealthy circles who are far removed from any struggle, conflict or life difficulty. Because of this, they perceive others as inhuman or below them, when the truth is the exact opposite. In conclusion, whether it was Joseph Kosinski's intention or not, ""Oblivion"" asks you to wake up and realize: You are overseeing the destruction of your human soul and are participating in the looting of planet Earth. But what do you do now? The film offers no other solution to this issue of the machine, other than to join a Jihad and bomb the system to kingdom come. As such, ""Oblivion"" may strike some users into consideration, but mostly passes off as a good time and is quickly forgotten in a sea of other consumables."
187,PYZ_Doc7_Oblivion,PYZ_Doc7_Oblivion,PYZ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, we just saw Oblivion. I think the writers were Oblivious to what makes a good story. SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) What we have here is all-too familiar. A movie with so much potential but so little delivery on that potential. GREG: Oblivion is Tom Cruise s latest offering. He stars as Jack Harper, a tech on a futuristic Earth. The Earth has been been in a war with an alien race - the Scavengers. We won the battle, but the Earth was decimated. So, all human life has been transplanted on Saturn s moon Titan. Meanwhile, Jack and his girlfriend are part of a mop-up crew that is responsible for siphoning off the Earth s oceans and ridding the planet of remaining Scavs. SCOTT: So far so good. But all is not what it seems. Jack discovers that a Scavs beacon has sent down a 60-year-old satellite containing several humans frozen in stasis. Only one of these humans, a woman, survives and triggers some older, hidden memories in Jack. We don t want to reveal what happens next, but let s just say that the arrival of this woman turns Jack s world entirely upside-down, and he spends much of the movie diving for cover from weapons fired at him from futuristic drones. GREG: And this is the beginning of the problem with Oblivion - we had to wait for half the movie before this important plot point. Getting there was interminable. We had to wade through Jack getting abducted and escaping with no particular effect on the plot. The strange thing about this movie is that the CGI is flawless. Someone spent a lot of money on the production. But the script is a mess. I found myself asking how this movie ever got made. Morgan Freeman makes an appearance but cannot save this movie. It is long, boring and I didn t care a whit about anyone in it. SCOTT: I m not quite as harsh in my assessment, but I do agree with you that the movie was long on impressive visual effects and short on character development. Filmmakers have got it in their heads that the only thing audiences want is stunning visuals, explosions, and chase scenes. It s true, I enjoyed those elements and absolutely loved the futuristic technologies, especially Jack s supremely cool little spaceship that zips around the atmosphere with the grace of an insect-like ballerina. We recently reviewed an old classic, Groundhog Day, which owed its emotional punch to the striking transformation of the lead character. Many movies today -- especially Tom Cruise movies -- are designed to be pleasing to the eye but atrophying to the brain. Characters don t develop, they just react to bullets. It s discouraging in a movie like this because there is so much potential for the story to rise to the level of the CGI. GREG: As a"

Is it the penchant to travel towards the unknown, the visual freedom, to allow your imagination to run wild and suspend belief or are we just so intrigued as a species by our future? I ask this question because we have no shortage of this genre of film. Gravity, Interstellar, Moon, After Life, Edge Of Tomorrow, Elysium, The Terminator franchise... The point is we are hooked and what a great avenue to become hooked on. The freedom and prospect to travel the unknown, to hold up certain boundaries while exploiting others, the idea of making or watching something fresh and visually exciting. Oblivion set out, with such bravado, with such intensity to create a visually stunning, thought provoking film and so many times does it come close to phenomenal greatness, its almost heart braking to watch it when it stumbles. And it stumbles a lot... especially in the final quarter. With Joseph Kosinski behind the wheel on this one, the director and reboot machine overlord that turned Tron into a patchy but gloriously fun event, with plenty of fan service, I was really excited to see the man create something new, something from beyond the confines of franchise, something that bolsters a huge selection of action and scope but a brilliant layer of depth. For the first 40 minutes I was in no way near dissapointed. Jack and Vika, lead an obscure but regimented life on the futuristic planet earth, much has changed, Aliens attack the earth, destroyed the moon, natural disasters almost wiped us out and with that came the war, an alien versus nuclear apocalypse that left all known survivors headed towards Saturn's moon Titan. Jack is a technical support and maintenance officer, left on a barron planet, taking orders from an obscure entity in the orbit of earth and allowing his partner and lover Vika to cover him with intelligence and support. His orders include fixing drones that protect the city from a species called Scav's, ensuring the protection of water harvesting mega machines and to report all findings back to Sally, an obscure contact from the monolithic space station. It's like groundhog day, until Jack discovers what we the audience have already began to discover, a long time ago, something is being with held from the couple, recurring nightmares about a familiar woman and of course the arrival of the familiar woman bring doubt to the whole infristructure and everything is not as it seems. Its around this point the film turns from optimistic science fiction into by the numbers tick boxes and although pretty much every aspect and group surrounding the creation of the film try their hardest to ensure it reaches the end point, it feels cheap, pushed and almost painful to land at the final conclusion we do. First of all there is a massive, massive amount to love about this film, the look alone is spectacular, the concept art, costume design, props"
189,PYZ_Doc9_Oblivion,PYZ_Doc9_Oblivion,PYZ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Oblivion is a slow wheeze of a movie, painting textures of things that don't really need painted, while expecting audiences to accept things just because they say so. And it all just sort of drifts by, slowly adding little details, little bits of tension, little bits of this and that, but none of it quite feels enough. At least Oblivion is beautiful on-screen and even though the little bits of this and that feel too little, what is there feels interesting and like we want to know more. The biggest mistake Oblivion makes is building a decent viewer rapport between Cruise and Riseborough, his ""wife""/""co-worker"" teammate in this only-two-humans-on-the-planet scenario. Their relationship is an interesting one, fractured and imperfect, but engaging as she keeps to the company line and Cruise views himself something of a loose cannon. But then, the event predicted from the first scene: Cruise's character re-encounters his old wife, someone a glimmer of a memory that had been wiped years ago. Suddenly the film dynamic changes. Less loyalty towards Riseborough's character, more interest in Kurylenko character. And this would be totally fine if Cruise and Kurylenko had any kind of rapport on screen. But they don't. Kurylenko's character doesn't exist to be her own character, she exists for how she adds to the plot that Cruise finds himself in. That is to say, from the very first flashback in that very first dream-heavy scene, Kurylenko's purpose is not to be a character, but to drive Cruise towards the desired outcome. It's no surprise, then, that their on-screen chemistry is poor. At least the filmmakers recognized this and kept her screen time to a minimum. (That's right, the game-changing love interest has her screen time limited; that says all you need to know about this movie.) Kurylenko isn't the only female character that is given the shaft here. The first half of the movie is all about the aforementioned Riseborough. She is actually given texture as a character and someone near to Cruise. There's that snap, crackle, and pop when she's on-screen. The greatest disservice to her character isn't so much that she gets dropped by Cruise the second he has an alternative (granted, an alternative he had already been married to), but that her character almost completely drops out of the movie in the second half. It's not that both halves of a movie need to snap with a specific character, but it's really ideal if either the second half is weighted that direction, or that character isn't dropped like a hot potato the second her plot-crucial role is over."
190,PYZ_Doc10_Oblivion,PYZ_Doc10_Oblivion,PYZ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Oblivion SCIENCE-FICTION Although, it initially came from a graphic novel by Joseph Kosinski who also co-wrote, co-produced and directed the film, the film still has many familiar elements from other films- most notably from the likes of ""Total Recall"", ""Wall-E"" and ""The 6th Day"" and then ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". The movie sets itself up by using a very confusing introduction where the planet earth is no longer livable- in the apocalyptic manner because of many nukes and Tsunmi's as the main star remembers it. For the only functioning purpose the earth has, is to pump it's water to another huge space ship called Tek, that's shaped like a huge sphere, located right beside the planet Earth. Cruise as Jack is there to see that it's running accordingly, he does this by flying a small automatically controlled spaceship and fly to specific flying zones, he's assigned to keep ""scavs"" (short for scavengers) from infiltrating this custom. Jack's other objectives also includes, fixing whatever computerized drones that get shot down by the Scavs, as well as to seek for actual Scavengers hideouts. Jack continues to do this along with a partner he thinks is his actual wife named Victoria(Andrea Riseborough) even though he has glimpses of a different kind of woman he was attracted to, and is forbidden to remember. Does this scenario sound familiar, like something coming out of 'Total Recall' for instance. Victoria's objective is to aid Jack's missions, and she also has the ability to control the ship from their home up above as well as assists Jack whenever he needs help. Anyways, the earth is supposed to be unlivable, but once he discovers a plant with some soil, he takes it along with him carrying it in a empty soup can. Can someone say ""Wall-E"" where one of the objectives in that film was to preserve a plant species where the soil was planted in a shoe. As I was saying, anyone who has seen and remember the science-fiction movies I listed above and perhaps more, including ""Elysium"" can actually predict many of the events and revelations way before they even happen, which may end up not only losing ""Oblivion's"" impact as a whole, including viewers comparing which movie scenes are better. Perhaps, if this film had been released way before some of the movies I had listed, then viewers can say that it was this film that did those scenes first. Thank god that wasn't case here, because you can only make the film as good as you make it, and I'd still give this film the same rating since after the film was over I still was left with many unanswered questions. On the physical sense, some of the existing problems with this movie is the fact that after the film was over, viewers never completely understood the main objective about why it had to be like this in the first place. Is there anything to gain by ridding the universe of any human life?"

He's still the loner type, sleeping in chairs instead of beds out of habit, unable to shut down his obsessive training and attention to detail. Ready to spark into action at any moment, he kills out of reflex. With a broken family to protect, his abilities slumber until awoken. And when you mess with his personal life, he fights back, unleashing a harsh vengeance that's unmatched no matter how many goons you assign to stop him. That's Liam Neeson's character in Taken. Of course, Neeson isn't playing a middle-aged version of techno-stomping action hero Jason Bourne; Matt Damon wouldn't dare relinquish his title so willingly. Rather, his name is Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA ""preventor"" who's given up his license to kill and life of international travel to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), though she lives with her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) in her stepdad's mansion. On her birthday, Kim gets a horsie and a party and lots more, but she also wants to go to Paris on vacation with her friend. Bryan doesn't think it's a good idea, and when your former superspy dad advises against something, you should really listen. Because he loves his little girl, he agrees to the trip. First thing off the plane, Kim and her friend virtually ask to be kidnapped when they share a cab with a strange man, who proceeds to ask them questions about where they're staying and so forth, which Kim and her friend willingly answer without a hint of suspicion. Kim's French holiday turns out pretty lousy when she's later kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers. Luckily, she made a call to Daddy before she was ripped away from the phone. Bryan knows the score. A few telephone calls to his former associates later, and he's hot on the trail of bad guys doing scummy things. Unlike the aforementioned Bourne, Neeson's character has some emotional involvement beyond saving his own skin. He's on a desperate search, using harsh skills any parent of a kidnapped child wishes they had. While outsmarting local authorities, he tears into the Parisian underworld and leaves few alive to tell the tale. He kills without compunction in a perilous search to find his daughter, and while normally such unrelenting remorselessness might turn off some viewers, we never blame Bryan for his extreme prejudice. And indeed, his retaliations are extreme, as he tortures and kills execution-style those involved in the kidnapping. It might be suggested that Bryan is a symbol of American militarism, storming in and killing everyone in sight when one of his own gets into trouble, except the subtext in this yarn is too thin to analyze with any seriousness. Neeson offers a performance that won't earn him any praise for nuance or multilayeredness, but he creates a singular force, believable enough in his deep voice that, to be sure, his character can and will do"
192,SAF_Doc2_Taken,SAF_Doc2_Taken,SAF,Action,Positive,Taken,"Liam Neeson believed that ""Taken"" would be ""a little side road"" on his career, suspecting that the action film would likely go straight to video. He was wrong. The relatively low-budget thriller  it was made for about $25 million  was a runaway hit, netting more than $145 million domestically over nine weeks in the box-office top ten. The 20th highest-grossing film of 2009, ""Taken"" begat a pair of sequels, both of which also topped the box office and made decent money (though they fared better overseas than domestically). As for Neeson's career, the side road proved to be long and winding. Suddenly, the veteran was an action star  a decided change of pace for a guy until then associated with prestige fare like ""Schindler's List"" and soft-edged characters like his mourning widower in ""Love Actually."" To correct a common misconception, though, the transformation wasn't immediate. In the aftermath of ""Taken,"" Neeson continued on two of the roads he frequently trod in the aughts: big-budget tentpoles and little indie flicks. He appeared in ""Chloe"" and ""After.Life"" the next year, and continued lending his voice to the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series (along with the English-language dub of the Studio Ghibli film ""Ponyo."") He did ""The A-Team"" and ""Clash of the Titans."" He had a very particular set of skills, but he wasn't yet willing to use them too often. The more robust career change set in a full two years after ""Taken,"" with Neeson taking the lead in ""Unknown"" in 2011 and both ""The Grey"" and ""Taken 2"" in 2012. (In fact, it was longer than that; ""Taken"" debuted overseas a full year before its US release, so it's better thought of as a 2008 film.) Three separate action flicks  ""Non-Stop,"" ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" and ""Taken 3""  appeared in 2014, immediately followed by ""Run All Night"" in 2015. Now the side road was a full-on career path  one that continues to this day. As I write this, the middling action flick ""The Marksman,"" starring Neeson as a disgruntled Texan rancher and ex-Marine, is the number one movie in America. Somehow, it's the second Liam Neeson movie to top the box office since the pandemic began. The road from ""Taken"" to Liam Neeson, Action Workhorse may not have been direct, but ""Taken"" was certainly the starting point. While he does bring a physical intensity  mostly around the eyes and fists  to action roles, the real source of this trend is his voice. It's no accident that the ""I will find you and I will kill you"" speech has become a meme; hearing Neeson's comforting, whiskey-kissed voice turn direct and sinister is the key moment in ""Taken,"" the most memorable thing in a fundamentally formulaic film. It also helped ""Taken,"" particularly in word-of-mouth, that it is direct, quick and uncomplicated. Running a breezy 90 minutes, the film has no interest in side-plots or detailed world building; aside from some dispensable business with a corrupt"
193,SAF_Doc3_Taken,SAF_Doc3_Taken,SAF,Action,Positive,Taken,"Taken's"" greatest asset resides within the perfectly cast Liam Neeson and the deliberate build of his fascinatingly merciless character. Rather than jump directly into the advertised plot, the film is careful to explore the anti-hero's troubled relationships and hint at the dark past that allows him to transform into the ruthlessly efficient soldier requisite for the task at hand. Halfway through the film, when audiences discover to what extent the protagonist is willing to go to accomplish his mission, it's impossible not to be engaged in his brutally unrelenting plight. Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job of long hours and dangerous work in an attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But with a restrictive ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and his naturally overprotective impulses, he finds the young woman drifting further away. Not wanting to compound their strained relationship, Bryan reluctantly permits Kim to vacation in Paris, giving her more freedom than he's comfortable with. Things quickly spiral out of control when she's kidnapped by Albanian slave traders from her hotel room. Now, in a desperate and deadly quest, Bryan will stop at nothing to track down those responsible, to save his daughter from the clutches of a depraved organization. Luc Besson certainly has an obsession with shady men with checkered pasts, forced to delve into disturbing criminal underworlds to seek redemption and vigilante justice. Antiheroes come in many styles, and although some critics may scour at unoriginal aspects of Liam Neeson's Bryan, the man still knows how to be a badass. In the rescue of his daughter, he has no limits; this creates many unexpected scenes of exercising an iron will and a frightening determination, which finds a seemingly heroic man donning a guise of villainy. And yet, all of it feels righteous  it's a testament to character design when the hero can remain a hero even after viciously torturing criminals or shooting innocent people to force a few quick answers. He may not be entirely unique, but this hardboiled, unflinching ""preventer"" is simply fixating. ""Taken"" is an action film connoisseur's perfect guilty pleasure. Bubbling over with chase sequences, shootouts (the kind where the baddies supply all the firepower), and fistfights, it takes on a realism not found in many of the action-for-the-sake-of-action flicks of recent years. Bryan's hand-to-hand combat skills don't rely on flamboyant or showy martial arts, instead taking a more realistic approach, with plenty of one-hit takedowns and throat-chops that effectively subdue the enemy in a stealthier manner. The authenticity of it all may be negotiable, but it's refreshing to see simpler forms of attacking and defending  and it's certainly more believable when random gun-toting henchmen aren't prepared with perfect kung-fu fighting techniques to combat the specially trained protagonist. ""Taken"" prides itself on its serious, dark tone. The villains' atrocities are amplified by their detestable trade; they will receive no sympathy from viewers when they get what's coming to them. The hero is also rather remorseless,"

How curious, then, that ""Taken,"" the one good film they do make (and a proven box office success overseas), not only gets pushed from its original release date, but then gets dumped into the cinematic cesspool of January with almost no marketing. Way to go, Fox. If there's any proof the studio really is being run by a bunch of monkeys, this is it, because ""Taken"" might just be one of the best action thrillers of the last decade. Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA agent who has given up his career and moved to Los Angeles in order to be closer to his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who now lives with her mother (Famke Janssen) and wealthy stepdad (Xander Berkeley). When Kim asks Bryan to sign a waiver allowing her to go on a month-long trip to Paris, he's hesitant at first, knowing full well of the dangers that exist in the world. Eventually, though, he agrees, but only under the condition that she follow his strict set of rules. As it turns out, Bryan's apprehensions were completely warranted, as Kim and her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) are snatched up within hours of setting foot in Paris by a group of traffickers in the prostitution trade. Now, Bryan has 96 hours to find his daughter before she's gone forever, and he'll use whatever means necessary to get her back. With the ""Bourne"" series on hiatus and the third installment of ""Transporter"" proving to be even more ridiculous than the last, it's nice to see a movie like ""Taken"" come along that incorporates elements of both franchises into a darker action thriller where the protagonist is more Jack Bauer and less James Bond. In fact, while the Fox drama may be trying to get away from the subject of torture by having its lead character constantly scrutinized for his questionable interrogation tactics, ""Taken"" embraces it with the most seat-squirming torture scene since ""Casino Royale."" Of course, Neeson's character doesn't have that much time to waste, so most of the movie adopts the kind of quick and sharp action that the ""Bourne"" series made famous. A chop to the throat here, a break of the neck there; whatever it takes to dispose of your enemy and keep moving. And move he does. Though the film takes some time to get going, once Neeson arrives in Paris, the 91-minute runtime flies by like its stuck on fast-forward. That's because the script (co-written by Luc Besson) only has one thing on its mind, and that's watching Liam Neeson beat the living shit out of anybody who gets in his way. Thankfully, the generic story is easier to swallow due to the involvement of Neeson, who lends the same kind of credibility to the role that Matt Damon did with"

It is unquestionably a trashy action movie of no particular aesthetic merit, a shallow pleasure at best. But oh, how very pleasurable it is. The movie stars Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA agent who has retired and moved to Los Angeles to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), a 17-year-old living the customary life of a spoiled brat with her indulgent mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) and wealthy stepdad Stuart (Xander Berkeley). One such indulgence is a trip to Europe to follow U2 for a month-long tour, something Bryan finds questionable in the extreme, but he allows himself to be guilted into it, though not without arming Kim with a laundry-list of guidelines to follow. Bryan's paranoia turns out to be quite well-placed; Kim and her BFF Amanda (Katie Cassidy) have hardly been in Paris half an hour when a group of thugs break into the empty apartment where they're staying, kidnapping them to press them into service as drugged-out prostitutes. Luckily for the girls, not so much for the kidnappers, Kim has her dad on the phone when this all happens, and he hears just enough to have a good idea of where to start looking for the kidnappers. Not to mention that it gives him the opportunity to issue a threat that you might have heard in the trailer, and might have read on the poster, but it's such a goddamn brilliant bit of purple prose, delivered by Neeson in such a terrifying purr, that I find myself anxious to repeat it in full: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" It's off to the races from that point on, and your ability to enjoy Taken whatsoever is largely going to be a function of your ability to turn off the parts of your brain that control suspension of disbelief and morality, and settle in for an hour of an enraged papa bear roaring his way through Paris en route to exacting bloody revenge on the men who took his little girl. The film is a glossy slab of empty calories that represents one of the highest recent peaks of a very particular film discipline: this is a Luc Besson Production, with all the magnificent badassery that phrase promises but only sometimes delivers.

The preposterous script is by Frenchman Luc Besson (who specializes in Eurotrash) and the American Robert Mark Kamen. The 56-year-old talented Irish thesp Liam Neeson steps down from his more arty pics and takes a turn as a James Bond type of action hero and single-handedly brings down a dangerous foreign crime ring on their turf, if you can believe. If escapist fantasy films that are fast-paced, filled with well-staged testosterone-driven action and you don't mind that it's not-to-be-taken seriously for even a sec, then this entertaining but mindless roller coaster ride of a taut film is probably just right for you. I found it too absurd to be 'taken' in by it, even its best assetits skill in filmmaking techniques left me thinking more bad trip than going with its adrenaline high. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA agent, who is divorced from his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). She's remarried to the tycoon Stuart (Xander Berkeley) and lives a life of pleasure in Los Angeles, while Bryan barely gets by on his pension. Doting estranged father Bryan just lives for his now 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), an aspiring pop singer, as he retired early because he missed following his daughter grow up and now wishes to make up for years of parental neglect due to career obligations. Against her overbearing dad's advice, the underaged Kim without an adult chaperone goes for a summer holiday with her teenager girlfriend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to Paris (which is viewed as a terrifying place by the spy and that teens on holiday can't be trusted to behave without supervision) when she agrees to his strict set of rules. As soon as Kim arrives in Paris for her summer vacation, a spotter (Nicolas Giraud) for an Albanian white slaver ring orchestrates the kidnapping of the two girls from their luxurious residence. The spy hears all this on the special cell phone he laid on his daughter and rushes to Paris, as his CIA pals in L.A. tell him he has at best 96 hours to save her from being swept away to a life of prostitution. Since Bryan seems to be the only one in the world capable of retrieving his daughter, he goes it solo. Just before he goes on his mission, he lets the kidnappers know that he has ""a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. . . . I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you."" If you don't find this silly and that the filmmakers are just cynically manipulating US foreign prejudices for this blockbuster entertainment spectacle to cash in, then you might as well sit back, relax and watch Neeson kick-ass with his repertoire of judo skills that he expertly does without making a fool of himself (also once in a"
197,SAF_Doc7_Taken,SAF_Doc7_Taken,SAF,Action,Negative,Taken,"On the narrative level, Taken is a fairly routine action thriller about a retired CIA operative who is forced to break out his tools and flex his old skills when his virginal teenage daughter is kidnapped abroad by human traffickers. There is little to distinguish it from dozens of interchangeable straight-to-DVD concoctions except for the fact that is stars Liam Neeson, who brings an immediate sense of heavyweight gravitas to what could have easily been a lightweight central role filled by any run-of-the-mill B-list action star. Once you put the man who has played Oskar Schindler, Michael Collins, Rob Roy, Jean Valjean, and Qui-Gon Jinn--vastly disparate roles, to be sure, but all of which are unified by their underlying intensity--the film is inherently transformed into something meatier. It gives the illusion of emotional depth and complexity where, in fact, there is none, but it's still an effective ploy. Unfortunately, the film itself doesn't quite live up to the dramatic heft provided by its star. Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who are now on their seventh collaboration after The Fifth Element (1997), Kiss of the Dragon (2001), Bandidas (2006), and the three Transporter films (20022008), Taken is fueled primarily by its sense righteous vengeance, which is highly contagious, especially in desperate times when audiences are looking for a cathartic release. Besson and Kamen provide plenty of irredeemable bad guys, including a group Armenian thugs who do the kidnapping, a group of soulless international businessmen (including an American) who wear tuxedoes and sip champagne while buying human bodies, and a corpulent Middle Eastern sheik whose wallowing girth marks him as the epitome of consumption takent to its grotesquely logical end. It's a rogue's gallery of depravity at all income levels, and Neeson's Bryan Mills blasts his way through all of them. Yet, that is precisely where the film comes up short. At virtually every turn it feels like it's pulling punches and not delving into the potentially dangerous visual terrain its story and its attendant emotions are screaming for (part of this may be due to the editing of the film's international version to earn a PG-13 rating for U.S. distribution, but my gut tells me the film is missing more than just a few seconds on the cutting room floor). The violence is quite brutal and Mills proves that he is not above shooting an arguably innocent woman (in the arm, but still ...) if it means he has a better chance of recovering his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But director Pierre Morel, one of Besson's proteges, keeps the violence visually restrained, which puts it in direct conflict with the film's underlying emotional premise. Besson has always had a soft spot for killers with a heart (see, especially, 1994's Leon), and Mills fits right in that category. When we first meet him, he is first and foremost a father who has given up his dangerous black ops career to get closer to Kim, but finds that he is"
198,SAF_Doc8_Taken,SAF_Doc8_Taken,SAF,Action,Negative,Taken,"A by the numbers action thriller, an offbeat indie trying to find an audience: it must be January at the movies! It's January which for film critics who don't make the trek to Sundance means that the junk, the filler, the hard to categorize and the small films which didn't create enough buzz to get award nominations vie for attention with all the good stuff that's still in theaters. Taken, a kidnap thriller starring Liam Neeson, falls somewhere between the junk and filler categories while Wendy and Lucy, a good example of minimalist cinema with Michelle Williams, didn't get enough buzz for Williams' nuanced performance to garner any nominations  at least not yet. In Taken, Neeson, his hair dyed black with red highlights, plays a retired espionage agent who draws upon his experience when his precious, though estranged, teenaged daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace, 17 going on 27), is kidnapped by a white slave ring while on vacation in Paris. Neeson heads to the City of Lights, where he tells a former spy buddy-turned-cop, ""I will tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to!"" In a series of increasingly unbelievable coincidences (including the kidnappers being identified by the sound of their accents!), that's just about what Neeson tries to do (one sequence involves him single-handedly taking out a brothel). Soon the unshaven villains with their bad teeth and ""tick ox-cents"" who have his baby know that a Jason Bourne type is hot on their trail but are still determined to sell her to the highest bidder before he catches them. Neeson, big and beefy, adroitly makes with the chop- socky, electronic gizmos and a range of firearms in his quest to reunite with Kim, all the better to repair their relationship and to introduce Kim, who wants to be a singer, to the Fergie-like pop star whose life he saved in the opening sequence of the movie. This silly hokum is so full of plot holes that it truly lives up to its title. But having been warned not to get Taken (sorry) the dumb- dumb movie is filled with enough familiar action sequences to please fans of Commando, the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger picture and its ilk Taken so closely resembles though Neeson could have used a sidekick with sass, like Rae Dawn Chong, to liven things up a bit. Oddly, with all the fuss over the recent spate of dog-themed pictures Bolt, Marley & Me, Hotel For Dogs, etc. Wendy and Lucy is one canine-centered movie that's a genuine tearjerker all the more so because its trappings are so undramatic and unstylized that it seems at times to be happening in real time. Williams plays Wendy, a shy loner, heading to Alaska and the promise of a summer job with her dog, Lucy. However, a run of bad luck forces her to rely against her nature on the kindness of strangers especially when her beloved Lucy disappears after Wendy's arrested for shoplifting dog food.

Unfortunately, he's also the kind of action star that can survive hundreds of rounds of bullets while taking out bad guys with deadly aim, an action movie cliche that has outlived the sophistication of today's audiences. That's not the only cliche and the film is also riddled with coincidence and contrivance, but Neeson, whose presence here is a bit of a mystery, keeps things interesting. We first meet Bryan reflecting on some 5th birthday pictures which mistakenly sets us up for a child kidnapping, but no, that child is now sixteen, albeit the type of sixteen year old who gallops about like an uncoordinated pony. Bryan has carefully chosen a top-of-the-line karaoke machine for his singer wannabe daughter and, once he gets past Lenore segregational party rules, presents it to a thrilled Kim. But no sooner has dad gotten a birthday photo for his scrapbook than Stuart presents his gift to Kim - a thoroughbred horse. Back at his crummy apartment, the doorbell rings and Bryan admits three ex-colleagues he'd forgotten were invited. They offer him an easy one-off security job escorting chart-busting singer Sheerah (Holly Valance) to and from a concert. Bryan accepts, and of course ends up saving Sheerah's life from a knife-wielding nut job, for which he gains heaps of gratitude, but before he can pass along the inside connections he's amassed to Kim, he's sideswiped with the Parisian summer trip. When the girls land at DeGaulle airport, they're approached by the good-looking young Peter (Nicolas Giraud) to share a cab. Later, when a worried dad finally reaches Kim on the cell phone he's given her, it is just in time for her to witness Amanda's forcible abduction. Dad instructs her to crawl under a bed and give him all the info she can when she's inevitably found. He gives the recording to buddy Sam (Leland Orser, ""Twisted,"" ""The Good German"") who informs him Kim has been taken by Albanians so dangerous even the Russian mob fears them and that their victims are never heard from again once 96 hours have passed. Bryan suppresses 'I told you so's' and commands Stuart to charter him a plane to leave 'an hour ago.' And so Bryan goes up against formerly friendly French authorities, the nasty white slavery ring and the rarified auction house they supply whenever they encounter a virgin, Kim's status as such having been conveniently foreclosed to Amanda. Bryan appears to be a crack agent on the Bourne level and in short order has located her jacket in a construction site bordello (where he gets the medical supplies to hook up the drugged teen"

All he wants is what's best for Kim, his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace). Divorced from her mother and overshadowed by her filthy-rich stepfather, he would, he says, ``sacrifice anything for her.'' Specifically, he would kill each and every scum he meets in Paris. The number he does on the City of Lights is comparable, corpse-for-corpse, to any damage wreaked by Jason Bourne. With one key difference: Jason has a conscience, or wishes he did. Bryan has none. I mean none. The only life that means anything to him is Kim's, and when she gets nabbed by Albanian sex traffickers on a trip abroad, Bryan hops on a plane and lays waste to gay Paree. ""You can't just run around tearing up Paris!"" whines a French colleague (Olivier Rabourdin). Au contraire, Bryan says: ""I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to."" Clench-jawed action star is a new gig for Neeson, but the Man Who Was Schindler has long worn the mantle of heroism. The twist this time is an utter lack of moral complexity. He's a dad, and he's a killing machine, and that's it. This blindered characterization makes for a driving premise and a few interesting scenes, but it gets to be a bore after the shock wears off. If he'll kill or maim just about anyone, where's the suspense? It's less Neeson's fault, or even director Pierre Morel's, than the movie's co-writers: Robert Mark Kamen and the entertainingly shlocky Luc Besson, who also produced. The Besson-Kamen writing team gave us The Fifth Element, all three Transporters and, most recently, a little Norwegian-Mexican comic Western called Bandidas. They're just the men for high-gloss knockabout bloodshed. So Bryan shoots people. He knifes them. He snaps their necks, sprays them with hot steam and chases them onto highway ramps where they're conveniently smooshed by oncoming traffic. He electrocutes a guy for information, then flips on the switch and leaves. He wings a lady whose only crime is cooking him a nice chicken dinner  and being married to the wrong man.The film's single most effective scene is the tense trans-Atlantic sequence when Kim, on the phone with her father, sees her airhead friend (Katie Cassidy) abducted in a Parisian flat and realizes the kidnappers are coming for her next. As Bryan instructs his daughter to scream identifying characteristics (height, hair color, tattoos) into her cell, the camera looks squarely at Neeson's pale brow and watery blue eyes. He doesn't cry; his face is gripped not by immobilizing grief but by pragmatism, professionalism and the need to act immediately. After he arrives in France, there's a bit of quirk with a fellow hired to translate Albanian. What a nifty touch  hey, Bourne never hired a temp.

Until two weeks ago, My friend came and asked me: ""Are you interested in movies about theory or science?"" I told him I really liked it and I also like action movies. So he recommended 'Inception' to me and he invited me to watch it together. The plot of the movie is about stealing ideas through dreams. Dom Cobb, the man who founded the intelligence espionage team. He is the best at entering dreams and steal valuable secrets from the subconscious of the target who is asleep. One day Cobb and the team meets an influential Japanese businessman named Saito who will hire Cobb to go on some missions in exchange for his return to the country without guilt. But instead, he hires Cobb to steal some information inside his rival mind. The mission turned out to be the opposite. When he wanted Cobb and his team to implant an idea into the mind of the son of the owner of his rival company. But it seems the new mission isn't as easy as it seems. When everything doesn't go as planned. As a result, Cobb and his team face more and more dangers on each floor of their dreams. While watching, I was surprised by the film production. Whether it's the actors, the plot, the setting, or the story. This movie is very interesting. It's a sci-fi action movie. Suitable for people who like movies with unexpected plots. Can't guess anything. This movie will keep our brains working for 2 and a half hours because it has many complicated theories. But it's full of interest with an unbeatable plot and the concept of Lucid dream, the most intricate. And I think that in that era, Inception was a very cutting edge movie. Because time probably won't be able to do anything about it. Even I came to see it after the movie had been shown for ten years. I'm still amazed by the plot, visuals and sounds, or scenes that I don't think ten years ago anyone would have thought of something like this. I don't know how Nolan's brain came up with something like this. The part that enhances the movie to fulfill the imagination of the viewer very well is probably the CG and the most spectacular cinematography. Each scene was created through Nolan's detailed thought process. Such as the scenes of the dream collapsing, the folding city, or the dream from the first floor to the last floor all create excitement for me viewer very well. I think Inception is a pretty difficult movie to watch. Because it takes thinking about the whole thing. Think along the storylines and characters. You may have to watch it two or more times to understand and relate to the movie more. Although it may be difficult to understand at first. But I would recommend watching this movie.

That weakened altered subconscious state is where Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a thought thief, does his dirty work. He insinuates himself into the dreams of CEOs, extracting secrets, committing new age corporate espionage. Not all his extractions have been perfect; in fact one has made his wife (Marion Cotillard) a casualty. Cobb draws the line at planting ideas in people's heads. That's called ""Inception."" He reverses his decision after he is approached by Saito (Ken Wantanabe), a sinister, devious businessman who for selfish reasons wants him to incept the mind of a rich heir. In return, Saito offers Cobb redemption. Cobb enlists his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a college student (Ellen Page, ""Juno"") and a sordid crew (Tom Hardy ""RockNRolla"", Dileep Rao ""Avatar"") to pull off the ultimate scheme. Director/writer Christopher Nolan conceived the premise for the film 10 years ago when he was first fascinated with blending waking life with dreams and the ability to corrupt dreams. His resulting screenplay has a complex, hard-to-follow, story-within-a-story, dream-on-top-of-dream plotline that might test the patience of the casual viewer. But stick with it; all the head-scratching antics lead to an intellectually stimulating and emotionally fulfilling finale. Nolan's eclectic, fine-tuned blend of action and art was firmly established with his signature Batman film, ""The Dark Knight;"" arguably the best action film made in the last two decades. Scenes of Cobb running from assailants in the streets of Mumbai are every bit as exciting as those in ""The Bourne Identity."" A sequence in a hotel hallway that is set on an angle with Arthur and an attacker fighting in zero gravity is stunning. Visuals of buildings and neighborhoods reflecting each other, and then landing on top of each other are spectacular. Nolan's extraordinary direction is aided perfectly by cinematographer Wally Pfister, editor Lee Smith, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers who were all part of ""The Dark Knight"" technical team. Using an angst-worn protagonist to give the sci-fi laden, techno-heavy story a personal feel was smart. It was even smarter to cast the ever-passionate DiCaprio in the pivotal lead role. Although, a sharp agent might encourage him to skip the overpowering real-or-not-real themed film genre (""Shutter Island"" opened just months ago) and take a roll in a simple drama where viewers could focus primarily on his acting (e.g. ""Basketball Diaries""). Wantanabe, Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard and Page give solid supporting performances, but DiCaprio's emoting drives this movie, albeit under a cloud of visual theatrics. Countless, empty-headed blockbusters have paraded across movie screens this summer. It's refreshing to experience an always-tense, extremely suspenseful sci-fi action film that respects a viewer's intelligence."
203,SSS_Doc3_Inception,SSS_Doc3_Inception,SSS,Action,Negative,Inception,"Christopher Nolan's Inception is Instruction Manual Cinema, a film that spends so much time explainingand explaining, and explainingthe rules of its narrative conceit that it fails to either emotionally engage or, except in a few notable spots, viscerally thrill. Working from a canvas at once larger than The Dark Knight and yet markedly reminiscent of it (not to mention countless other celluloid sagas), Nolan's would-be epic is a work of sometimes stunning imagery but only affected heart, a pseudo-heist film that borrows liberally from all corners of the cinematic world (The Matrix, eXistenZ, Last Year at Marienbad, the canons of David Lynch and Michael Mann) in service of a tale that's as hollow as its reality-bending Rubik's Cube ruses are intricate. Focusing on a secret agent man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who enters people's dreams to steal vital pieces of well-kept information, Nolan's sci-fi latest is enraptured by the sense of falling down the rabbit hole, not simply via its dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams centerpieces, but through the sheer wealth of information it vomits up at every turn. Head-spinning exposition takes the place of wonder throughout, leaving only the transient rush of particularly vivid visuals and a faint whiff of a better film that could have been. Nolan wastes no time with setup, immediately thrusting viewers into a perplexing scene in which Cobb washes up on a sunny shore, sees a vision of two young children playing in a grassy yard, and then visits an elderly Japanese man whom he seems to know. This encounter takes place in a gorgeously decorated chamber with wall panels and hanging lamps, but lingering to admire the sights isn't Inception's strong suit, and soon the film is off into other apparent realities, with chitchat filling in the gaps at breakneck speed. Turns out, Cobb is trying to pilfer valuable knowledge from corporate bigwig Saito (Ken Watanabe) as a test to see if he's up for a larger taskone that involves not taking info from someone's mind (a process called ""extraction""), but rather, inserting a new idea (dubbed ""inception"") in the noggin of energy magnate Maurice Fischer's (Pete Postlethwaite) only heir, Robert (Cillian Murphy). For mysterious reasons related to his dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a penchant for showing up unannounced in dreams and thwarting Cobb's robberies, Cobb isn't instantly interested in this dangerous, difficult gig. Nonetheless, Saito's promise that performing the job will mean Cobb can finally return home to the U.S.where his kids are, and from which he's been exiled for enigmatic legal reasonsquickly seals the deal. From there, we're treated to a lengthy middle section in which Cobb assembles his team and concocts his ruse, a standard heist-film structure that quickly proves most notable for the myriad rules governing dream infiltration, and for the wholesale lack of importance of said regulations. Phony tech, philosophical, and psychological terminology abounds but it's all of little concern except as a means of generating confusion, which in turn distracts attention from the inconsequentiality of the heist itself."
204,SSS_Doc4_Inception,SSS_Doc4_Inception,SSS,Action,Positive,Inception,"Why do we dream? Does anyone really know for sure? Probably not, but writer-director Christopher Nolan takes a stab at breaking down the structure of a dream and the influence of the subconscious in Inception. There's nothing more perplexing than the unknown and Nolan uses that to his advantage. It's one thing to simply make up a story about a theoretical concept, but it's another to come up with a scenario and actually make it feel real and that's exactly what he achieves in Inception. It may be Nolan's dream world, but it's so exciting, so disturbing and seems so authentic, you might start to wonder. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor. He's employed to sneak into people's dreams and steal their secrets. Turns out the gig comes with some serious baggage and Cobb wants out, but the only way he can safely return home is by completing one last job for a businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe). The problem is, Saito doesn't want Cobb to snatch someone's secret information, he wants him to do the unthinkable, plant an idea in a subject's mind  inception. The general premise, while intriguing, can sound pretty absurd, but Nolan approaches the story in such a well thought out and artistic manner, it practically feels real. Even when the information is sparse, Nolan grabs hold and doesn't let go through sheer stellar action and cinematography. In the film's opening scene, little is known about Cobb's line of work, however, you're eager to join his cause making the reality of the situation a little easier to digest when Cobb comes to. And that's when the real fun begins. Once the stage is set, Cobb begins to assemble his team for the inception gig. He's already got his right hand man, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but now must find himself an architect. That's where Ellen Page comes in. She plays Ariadne, a budding designer who's swooped up by Cobb and hurled into his dream worlds. Cobb also enlists the help of a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), a chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and even agrees to take his employer, Saito, along for the ride. Together they'll infiltrate the mind of an heir to a major corporation, Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy), and plant an idea so deep inside, he'll think it was his all along. Inception clocks in at a whopping 148 minutes, but not once will you feel compelled to check your watch. The drizzle of data during the opening sequence quickly becomes a shower once Cobb amasses his crew and from then on, even blinking can run you the risk of missing a vital piece of information. You're not a member of the audience, you're a member of Cobb's team and should you misstep, it could thwart the whole operation. Further aiding Nolan's effort to suck you into the scenario is his superb depiction of the action. In reality the colors are rich and the characters engaging, but once the player drifts off into"

But why? To what end? His new movie, ""Inception,"" is an astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly. Nolan has devoted his extraordinary talents not to some weighty, epic theme or terrific comic idea but to a science-fiction thriller that exploits dreams as a vehicle for doubling and redoubling action sequences. He has been contemplating the movie for ten years, and as movie technology changed he must have realized that he could do more and more complex things. He wound up overcooking the idea. Nolan gives us dreams within dreams (people dream that they're dreaming); he also stages action within different levels of dreamingdeep, deeper, and deepest, with matching physical movements played out at each levelall of it cut together with trombone-heavy music by Hans Zimmer, which pounds us into near-deafness, if not quite submission. Now and then, you may discover that the effort to keep up with the multilevel tumult kills your pleasure in the movie. ""Inception"" is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else. The outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper. Leonardo DiCaprio, with a full head of golden hair and a touch of goatee, plays Cobb, an international thief. Not a common thief, but an ""extractor"": he puts himself to sleep, enters the dreams of another person, then rummages around and steals something important that pops out of the sleeper's unconsciousan industrial secret, say. Saito (Ken Watanabe), the head of an enormous Japanese energy company, hires Cobb to go beyond extraction to inception; that is, not to steal an idea but to plant one that the dreamer will think is his own. Just like Danny Ocean preparing to crack a safe, Cobb assembles a larcenous crew, who will enter the mark's dreams with him. There's a dream architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), who can create convincing interior worlds, so that the dreamer will think that everything is real. There's a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), who, in the dreams, can embody any person known to the dreamer. There's a chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), to drop both the team and the target into deeper layers of sleep with a super-sedative. And there's a kind of dream manager, a demanding, unimaginative sourpuss named Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to insure that the fantastic sting comes off. There's also a wild card. Cobb's dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), keeps jumping out of the lower reaches of his mind bearing a knife or a gun and crashing into the created dreams. Cobb is still in love with her, and feels guilty about something he did to her. Occasionally, he takes a rusty old elevator down to his subconscious and visits her. Cotillard, with her amber coloring, is ravishing and tear-stained, and, if you"

Inception, Christopher Nolan's latest assault on rational coherence, wastes no time. It cuts straight to the chase that leads to the junkpile without passing go, although before it drags its sorry butt to a merciful finale, you'll be desperately in need of a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color, shading and shadows, and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea, reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who haven't got a clue about plot, character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento, the perilously inert Insomnia, the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige, the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical, maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolan's scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception, and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. It's difficult to believe he didn't also write, direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche, New York. But as usual, like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman, Mr. Nolan's reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players, none of whom have an inkling of what they're doing or what this movie is about in the first place, and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who remains one of the screen's most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese's dopey insane-asylum bomb, one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo, not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed. I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible. Let's see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave, I wanted to jump in, but the thrill didn't last. Cut to the battered face of Leo, looking like a 14-year-old washed ashore facedown from a toy sailboat. He has come from another location conjured up in a dream, and is fond of muttering jabberwocky like ""I am the most skilled extractor of dreams."" In other words, he can close his eyes, enter somebody else's dreams with his pock-marked baby face and blow up China.

207,SSS_Doc7_Inception,SSS_Doc7_Inception,SSS,Action,Negative,Inception,"Director Christopher Nolan is such a master movie technician -- a combination of engineer, architect, game designer and God -- that it's startling to realize how constricted his vision is and how clumsily he tells stories. ""Inception,"" Nolan's first film since his mega-googolplex hit with ""The Dark Knight,"" and his first as a solo writer-director since the now-legendary puzzler ""Memento"" in 2000, is supposed to be a dreamscape movie. At one point, in fact, we travel with its central Scooby-gang of characters into a dream within a dream within a dream, and then into some deeper, still more unconscious, psychological limbo-state below that. Managing all these nested levels of narrative is a marvelously nerdy accomplishment, no doubt -- but this is the most tight-assed vision of the innermost human psyche I've ever seen. While Nolan's images are visually impressive and powered by state-of-the-art digital effects and accomplished stunt work, they're always ordered and organized with anal precision. They don't look or feel anything like dreams. (Or, at least, not like my dreams.) They look instead like mediocre action films from the '90s, or in the case of the supremely boring ski-patrol vs. Arctic fortress shootout found on Level Three, like the Alistair MacLean adaptation ""Ice Station Zebra"" from 1968. (With Rock Hudson! And Ernest Borgnine!) ""Inception"" may have been directed by Christopher Nolan, but Nolan's dreams are apparently directed by Michael Bay. OK, I know -- you want me to back off the high-minded analysis and tell you whether ""Inception"" is a good destination for those summer moviegoing dollars eager to leap out of your wallet. Sure, I guess so. It's a cool-looking action movie, carefully constructed and edited, that uses all kinds of nifty locations and a lot of portentous-sounding expositional yammering. It inhabits a Philip K. Dick-style universe of psychological warfare that suggests ""The Matrix,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" -- all of them, by the way, better movies -- but it's fairer to call ""Inception"" a maze movie or a labyrinth movie than a puzzle movie. Because, as the wisecracking fellow critic sitting next to me observed, every time the story gets puzzling the characters call a timeout and explain it. So, yeah, if you approach ""Inception"" with lowered expectations it's a pretty good time. Problem is, there are no lowered expectations around Christopher Nolan, whose adherents have proclaimed him as the heir to Kubrick and Hitchcock and declared ""Inception"" a masterpiece. I don't want to get sidetracked here, but let me suggest that the comparisons aren't entirely misguided. They're just not helpful. Nolan has inherited some of Kubrick and Hitchcock's worst tendencies, most notably their defensive, compulsive inclination to work everything out about their stories and characters to the last detail, as if human beings and the world were algebraic or geometrical phenomena requiring a solution. But the mysterious power of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" cannot be explained by the ludicrous official story revealed in the final act -- indeed, it nearly scotches the whole movie -- and"

Slap! Wake up, people! Shalalala! Slap! Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb (the name sounds like it should evoke somethingbut what? Dummkopf?), who specializes in plunging into people's ""subconscious"" minds while they sleep and extracting their corporate secrets. (I'm with Freud in preferring ""unconscious."") But his new client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants the impossible: for Cobb not to steal an idea but to plant one in a business rival's head. Why is an ""inception"" more difficult than an extraction? ""The subject's mind always knows the genesis of an idea,"" explains one characterwhich strikes my unoriginal and highly suggestible mind as dead wrong. But that's the premise, anyway. Cobb accepts the job because he longs to see his two little kids in the U.S. and is forbidden to return on account of a Crime to Be Revealed Later; and Saito says that with one phone call he can make the legal problems go away. (He just can.) Then Saito says what in this kind of thriller are magic words: ""Assemble your team."" A team of colorful specialists! Cool! So it's, like, Mission: Impossible in the Dreamscape-Matrix! Cobb's point man is Arthur, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also evokes The Matrix: He looks like Keanu Reeves's runty little brother. Eames (Tom Hardy) is the ""forger,"" who can impersonate people in dreams without those dumb M:I rubber masks. The chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), will create the badass sedatives that will hold the fragile three-dream edifice together. The brilliant architecture student Ariadne (Ellen Page) has two functions: dreamworld designer and exposition magnet. She's a newbie, so Cobb has to explain to her how the science works. It takes a lot of explaining. Nolan, who wrote the script, thinks like a mechanical engineer, and even when you can't follow what's happening, you can admire in theory the multiple, synchronized narrative arcs and cute little rules for jumping around among different flights of consciousness. He has two fresh ideas. In a dream, you can fall asleep and have another dream, in which you can fall asleep and have another dreamexcept time works differently at different depths. A minute up top might be, say, ten minutes in the dream, an hour in the dream within a dream, and, below that, years. Although the different levels look the same (too bad), the gimmick allows Nolan to have three clocks ticking down instead of one, and the editor, Lee Smith, has cut among them in ways so ostentatious that he's all but sewn up this year's editing Oscar. The other neat touch is the Freudian monster femme who keeps popping up: Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who emerges from his own unconscious (even in other people's dreams) to"
209,SSS_Doc9_Inception,SSS_Doc9_Inception,SSS,Action,Positive,Inception,"Inception is a movie about ideas, quite literally-- stealing them, creating them, their power and their ability to linger. But this is a Christopher Nolan movie, so of course it's about Big Ideas, about reality and heartbreak and choosing how to best live our too-brief lives. The fact that Inception is also fun and emotional and thrilling, even with all those eggheady concepts wrapped inside it, makes the movie a true marvel. It's not quite perfect, but it's uncommonly ambitious and courageous, which is close enough. Don't worry too much about spoilers for this film, as the central concepts of Inception are too complicated and frankly ridiculous sounding to be clear from the mouth of anyone but Nolan and his characters. At its core Inception is a heist movie, about a team of operatives led by haunted soul Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) to venture into peoples' minds and extract the darkest secrets from their subconscious. In this particular mission, which will be Dom's last, the goal is a little different. Japanese business mogul Saito (Ken Watanabe) has assigned them to the perilous task of Inception, planting an idea so deep in the subconscious of rival CEO Fischer (Cillian Murphy) that he believes he thought of it himself. Like any good thief, Dom must assemble a team, and he sticks with the best-- his young stuffed shirt second-in-command Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), budding architectural prodigy Ariadne (Ellen Page), slippery thief Eames (Tom Hardy), chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) and Saito himself, who tags along despite Eames's condescending ""There's no room for tourists on these jobs."" Dom and his team don't just enter Fischer's dream, they define it, guiding him toward his darkest secrets and so far through several layers of consciousness that the risks are compounded even further than usual. It's a tough job under the best of circumstances, but when immersed in dreams-- his own or someone else's-- Dom is haunted by a particularly persuasive projection of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), who shows up to ruin his missions for reasons Dom isn't willing to explain. The layers of the heist fall in place like the familiar Nolan clockwork, so that the images that seem so foreign in the trailers-- zero-gravity fights in hallways, stony cliffs collapsing into oceans-- make perfect sense within the airtight dream logic of the movie. It's not just that Inception whips between beautiful foreign locations and tweaked dream realities, but that each of those created worlds seem fully realized to the tiniest surreal detail; Nolan uses his penchant for polished, elegant visuals to create dream worlds that are unsettling in their perfectness. The warm ochre lights in a dining room, the glistening fruit at a market in Paris-- all are beautiful, all are fake, and all represent our subconscious as it reveals our deepest secrets. Nolan's screenplay, which he worked on for nearly a decade, keeps the audience on a leash that is expertly loosened and tightened throughout, allowing us sometimes to predict what's coming and other"

Whatever pleasures or terrors the dream state provides, we experience them alone or not at all. But what if other people could literally invade our dreams, what if a technology existed that enabled interlopers to create and manipulate sleeping life with the goal of stealing our secret thoughts, or more unsettling still, implanting ideas in the deepest of subconscious states and making us believe they're our own? Welcome to the world of ""Inception,"" written and directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan, a tremendously exciting science-fiction thriller that's as disturbing as it sounds. This is a popular entertainment with a knockout punch so intense and unnerving it'll have you worrying if it's safe to close your eyes at night. Having come up with the idea when he was 16, Nolan wrote the first draft of ""Inception"" eight years ago and in the interim his great success with ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" not to mention the earlier ""Memento,"" put him in a position to cast Leonardo DiCaprio and six other Oscar-nominated actors and spend a reported $160 million in a most daring way. For ""Inception"" is not only about the dream state, it often plays on screen in a dreamlike way, which means that it has the gift of being easier to follow than to explain. Specifics of the plot can be difficult to pin down, especially at first, and guessing moment to moment what will be happening next, or even if the characters are in a dream or in reality, is not always possible. But even while literal understanding can remain tantilizingly out of reach, you always intuitively understand what is going on and why. Helping in that understanding, and one of the film's most satisfying aspects, are its roots in old-fashioned genre entertainment, albeit genre amped up to warp speed. Besides its science-fiction theme, ""Inception"" also has strong film noir ties, easily recognizable elements like the femme fatale, doomed love and the protagonist's fateful decision to take on ""one last job."" That would be DiCaprio's Dom Cobb, a thief who specializes in what's called extraction, in taking secrets from the subconscious. Aided by Arthur (a fine Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the trusted associate who is a whiz at the mechanics involved, Cobb is introduced in the middle of a dream involving Saito ( Ken Watanabe), a wealthy Japanese businessman. That one last job is soon proposed by Saito, who asks Cobb if he is also able to do inception, the planting of ideas, a maneuver many people believe can't be done. Saito promises Cobb, who has a past which prevents him from returning to his children in America, the one thing he can't resist. If he takes on this one last job, if he agrees to practice inception on Robert Fischer ( Cillian Murphy), the heir to a multibillion-dollar energy empire, he will be able to return home. In true movie fashion, Cobb has to round up a team to do the job. Aside"

Classic enough to spawn its own mini-franchise, at least, as well as prop up the fortunes of Kaufman's company, Troma Entertainment, for multiple decades. And you don't mess with the classics, which is why it's just as well that writer-director Macon Blair throws it all out but the toxic waste in his new reboot. Compared to Kaufman's proud juvenilia, the point of view in this rebooted ""Toxic Avenger"" is downright mature. Peter Dinklage stars as Winston, a janitor at a sinister corporation called BT Healthstyle in the town of St. Roma's Village (start knocking out letters, and you'll get it) and a single stepfather to sensitive preteen Wade (Jacob Tremblay). Wade's mother died of cancer a few years earlier, and Winston dutifully cares for her son while getting little emotionally in return. He's broke, meek, and lonely, but finds a renewed will to live when a doctor diagnoses him with ... something very bad going on in his brain. (The actual diagnosis is drowned out by the sound of jackhammers outside the office.) This leads to some light satire of the American healthcare system, as Dinklage breaks down on a Kafkaesque insurance call and sobs, ""I don't know what that means."" It's one of the more genuine moments in the movie. Dinklage's warm, fatherly presence grounds early stretches of the film, as absurdist bits reminiscent of another tongue-in-cheek recent project, Ari Aster's ""Beau Is Afraid,"" bounce all around him. (One faux ad for a BTH product asks if the viewer is suffering from a long list of ailments like ""Hunches & Goofs"" and ""The Mondays."") Then he's transformed into the title character, and encased inside of a full-body suit of special effects makeup that makes it difficult for the actor to move around too much, let alone emote. Here, ""The Toxic Avenger"" starts to lose its gravitational pull. Co-sar Elijah Wood is hilarious, but underutilized as the Riff Raff-esque brother of the film's ultra-rich big bad, played by Kevin Bacon. One cutaway sees Wood's character interrupted while mournfully playing the pan flute alone on a darkened stage. Bacon, meanwhile, glibly spoofs billionaire weirdos like biohacker Bryan Johnson, building to a climax that must have been fun to shoot, even as it lacks momentum. Things just kind of happen in ""The Toxic Avenger."" Take Taylour Paige's role as a BTH whistleblower who helps Winston get his revenge for the whole ""throwing him into a vat of toxic waste and turning him into a mutant vigilante"" thing. The character's purpose in the story, and Paige's purpose as an actor in it, remain underdeveloped throughout. But she has some snarky back-and-forth with Dinklage when the two of them end up in a comedic dilemma together later on in the movie, and that's what's important here. Still, there are some very funny bits in ""The Toxic Avenger."" One of the biggest and most absurd involves a band called the"

Back in 1984, New York super-sleazoid producer and acknowledged big-hearted hero of indie cinema Lloyd Kaufman launched a surprising franchise with the original The Toxic Avenger, a low-low-low-budget superhero spoof about a nerdy janitor called Melvin Ferd Junko III, who is transformed by industrial waste into a squish-faced juggernaut of violent vengeance, and the hero of Tromaville. This big-budget remake of The Toxic Avenger (a term that, in itself, sounds like a joke) pays homage by having a character called Melvin Ferd, but when he gets wiped out by an evil gang/monstercore band in the opening sequence it's clear this isn't your parent's Toxie. Instead, this time it's Winston Gooze (Dinklage), also a janitor but now not some dweeb living with his mother and desperate for a date. Winston's a single dad  even more, a single stepdad to Wade (Jacob Tremblay)  who just discovered that he has a horrible brain disease and about a year to live. Blame his job at BTH, a lifestyle pharmaceutical giant run by Bob Garbinger (Kevin Bacon), who uses his brother, Fritz (Elijah Wood), as his enforcer. The mild-mannered Winston inadvertently takes a dip in the gunk just after getting involved with whistleblower J.J. Doherty (Taylour Paige, Zola) and emerges as the hero that the community of St. Roma's Village both needs and deserves. That Melvin Ferd reference is one of a multiplicity of nods to the Tromaverse, the loosely interlinked continuity created by Kaufman and his coterie of wild creatives over the years. They're the most superficial signs that writer/director Macon Blair  making a dramatic leap from from his directorial debut, the mournful but soulful I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore  is a fan. But the Austinite also understands what makes Troma special. These are kids' movies for adults: not because they condescend to the audience, but because of their giddy, guileless optimism. Bad guys are bad, good guys are good (and just about everyone has some good in them somewhere), and swearing and poop are hilarious. Most importantly, there's nothing wrong with a good, old-fashioned, rabble-rousing message. In this case, it's that environmental pollution and business run amok are bad. Yeah, it's obvious, but what's wrong with that? And what's wrong with making that clear in a ridiculous, over-the-top, madcap satire? Let's be real: More people will press play on a movie called The Toxic Avenger on a Friday night than on the excellent but decidedly art house How to Blow Up a Pipeline. Get your message out however you can. Not that this is some dry enviro-message. Kaufman worked out years ago how to weave his politics in among all the mutated poultry gags, and Blair gets it, too. Most importantly, so does his cast. Bacon hasn't been this irrepressibly"

Made for a paltry $500,000 in 1984, Troma's cult classic spawned three direct sequels, a rock musical, two video games, a short-lived animated series and now a remake starring Peter Dinklage. Given the eco-friendly, anti-pollution message at the improbable franchise's core, perhaps its reemergence shouldn't be surprising. Those problems haven't exactly been alleviated in the intervening decades, with rising sea levels and melting glaciers acting as a kind of real-world Bat Signal. In some ways, remakes of this sort have more to live up to than updated versions of massively successful blockbusters do. The self-selecting audience of a cult classic like ""Toxic Avenger"" may not be large, but it is fiercely devoted. Actor-turned-filmmaker Macon Blair, who earned acclaim for his roles in ""Blue Ruin"" and ""Green Room"" before making his directorial debut with ""I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore,"" has his work cut out for him. Blair seems aware of that, as the film's opening narration  ""I didn't want any of this""  could double as a commentary on the responsibilities inherent in reimagining a beloved story and an expression of certain fans' reactions to said reimagining's very existence. It's hard to imagine those die-hards being let down. It's also difficult to imagine ""The Toxic Avenger"" winning over any schlock-averse viewers who aren't already on board with its brand of campy, over-the-top violence. This is largely a fans-only proposition, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. After spending a little time with Winston Gooze (Dinklage), you'll see why he was world-weary even before being turned into St. Roma's Village's (a play on the original's Tromaville) resident folk hero. A single stepdad to a teenager (Jacob Tremblay) whose mother died of cancer, he works as a janitor at a chemical factory that pollutes the surrounding area even more than the nuclear reactor in ""The Simpsons."" That evil corporation is owned by Bob Garbinger (Kevin Bacon), whose products' side effects have killed so many people that it's a surprise no one tried taking him down before J.J. (Taylour Paige). After receiving a troubling diagnosis and failing to navigate his company's byzantine insurance plans, Winston entreats his mega-rich boss for help, only to be cruelly rebuffed. One failed robbery attempt and an involuntary trip to the toxic-waste pool later, our mild-mannered protagonist is reborn as a B-movie Joseph Merrick. The effects are appropriately grotesque, transforming Winston into a mutated whatsit that would make Freddy Krueger blush. His corroded skin has taken on several hues that surely don't occur anywhere in nature, his now-enormous left eye frequently falls out of its socket and his blood runs blue. Dinklage grounds his tragic hero in the sadness that birthed him. One crucial difference between Blair's film and the original is that here the lead actor voices both iterations of his character, and the contrast between his"

Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufmanthe self-proclaimed cine-shlock king of exploitationwas there at Fantastic Fest to pass the torch (or the mop) over to actor-director Macon Blair (Green Room, I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore) for a new take on The Toxic Avenger. Like many wannabe filmmakers, including James Gunn, Troma movies were a kind of run-and-gun film school that taught up-and-coming talent how to navigate the controlled chaos of the movie business. Blair himself grew up at the altar of Troma where The Toxic Avenger, Tromeo & Juliet, and Terror Firmer drilled their way into his very impressionable brain. Now, Blair has gifted audiences of a certain ilk with his big-budget version of Toxie that keeps the spirit of Troma alive while also infusing a little bit of heart into the mix. In the role he was never really born to play and somehow agreed to, four-time Emmy award winner Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones) stars as Winston Gooze, a lowly janitor working for the corrupt nutraceutical company BT Healthstyle. When a downtrodden Winston learns he has a fatal brain fog disease, he asks his slick boss Bob Garbinger (a smarmy Kevin Bacon) for help. After being summarily rejected, Winston dips his mop into a vat of toxic waste and makes a failed attempt to rob his employer. Instead, Garbinger's evil henchman, the Killer Nutz, force Winston to dive head-first into a bubbling ooze, transforming him into a mutant. Our reluctant hero eventually sets out to avenge his own dark, disgusting fate, becoming a beacon of hope for the less fortunate townspeople in St. Roma's Village (a clever bit of wordplay to honor Troma's excessive use of bad puns). In the original 1984 film, a bullied nerd named Winston (Mark Torgl) transforms into the muscle-bound Toxic Avenger (Mitchell Cohen) to get back at his tormentors. From there, the cult classic plays out like a grotesque version of WrestleMania. Here, Dinklage's dedicated performance gives Toxie a warm center and a deeper level of pathos. It's unclear just how often and when Dinklage is acting under the weight of the extensive makeup and prosthetics work. His eyes pierce through the mask, though, and his booming voice makes the over-the-top theatrics feel a little more grounded. The creature work updates Toxie's look for a new generation and definitely takes inspiration from the short-lived cartoon Toxic Crusaders from the early '90s. The dedication Dinklage brings a certain legitimacy to The Toxic Avenger which automatically makes it seem even more ridiculous. Seeing A-list actors going full tilt for Blair's whacked-out vision is a bit surreal at times, and that's the point of casting them in the first place. Bacon, in particular, looks reinvigorated playing an evil corporate cliche who becomes obsessed with extracting Toxie's blood for a new super elixir he can sell to the masses.

215,URD_Doc5_The_Toxic_Avenger,URD_Doc5_The_Toxic_Avenger,URD,Horror,Positive,The_Toxic_Avenger,"From Macon Blair (I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore), The Toxic Avenger is a reboot of the original 1984 film released by Troma Entertainment. Winston (Peter Dinklage) is a mild-mannered janitor who wants to live his life, be a good person and care for his stepson Wade (Jacob Tremblay). Winston works at a health club called Garb-X, run by Bob Garbinger (Kevin Bacon), which is known for dumping large amounts of toxic waste. Bob relies on his brother Fritz (Elijah Wood) to run damage control, even if it means taking specific suspected individuals out of the equation entirely. When Winston is diagnosed with a terminal brain illness, he tries to rob the company he works for. He crosses paths with a young whistleblower, J.J. Doherty (Taylour Paige), who wants to expose Garb-X for their relentless corruption. When Fritz and his goons accidentally take out Winston instead of J.J., they try to hide his body by dumping it in a pool of toxic waste. Unfortunately for them, Winston is transformed into a green, lethal freak of justice who uses his lethal mop to liquefy evildoers. If you're unfamiliar with Troma, it's a studio founded by The Toxic Avenger creator, Lloyd Kaufman, that fully embraced horror tropes such as over-the-top gore and full-on nakedness. While some would view that as trashy cinema, others, including horror fans, were ecstatic to have a studio that was proud of its horror roots. This new version of The Toxic Avenger is an homage to the original but also updated with a modern perspective. Speaking as someone who hasn't seen the original films, you can enjoy, or at least view, this reboot without knowing the franchise. The performances are relatively robust for a horror reboot. Peter Dinklage annihilates anyone he points his mop at. Still, you can't help but sympathize with the character because he has a good heart and is on this unbelievable onslaught for all the right reasons. Kevin Bacon portrays a character similar to Sebastian Shaw in X-Men: First Class, except with far more yelling and a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde twist. His Jon Bon Jovi/John Rzeznik hairstyle gives him an added layer of pure douchebaggery that doesn't disappoint. Elijah Wood walks hunched over with one foot longer than the other, as Fritz Garbinger. The character has this pale and greasy smarminess that you'd associate with Brad Dourif's Wormtongue from The Lord of the Rings films. The eclectic ensemble that Fritz is in charge of, known as the Killer Nutz, is a group of failures that double as a metalcore band trying to make a big break. One of them is obsessed with parkour, and the most muscular runs around wearing a chicken mask, featuring a genuinely bizarre reveal later on in the film. The Toxic Avenger, referred to as Toxie in the original films, never hesitates to annihilate his opponents. He rips off arms, obliterates jaws, tears off heads, and even rips a guy's intestines through his buttcheeks. The"

It also stars Peter Dinklage, one of our greatest actors, giving an Elephant Man-level performance while encased in layers of bulbous fake boils and Day-Glo rubber for most of the runtime. Elijah Wood, looking exactly like Danny DeVito's Penguin from Batman Returns, is a sympathetic henchman, and Kevin Bacon chews up the screen as the main villain, a vain corporate CEO who enjoys walking around shirtless and receives regular infusions of 'Gorilla Blood.' So it's hard to know what to make of this movie. On the one hand, it stays true to its grade-x Troma Film roots. On the other, it features actual movie stars and skirts around the edges of mainstream satire, at least until a scene where the protagonist rips out a criminal's guts through his butthole. Dinklage plays Winston Gooze, a widower and broke janitor who works at Kevin Bacon's factory, which purports to make health supplements but is actually a toxic waste depository that has obliterated the surrounding landscape. Gooze develops a rare form of brain cancer, but his health insurance won't pay for the treatments. So he concocts a pathetic plan that ends with some henchmen shooting him in the head and dumping him in a vat of toxic waste. He emerges as ""Toxie,"" a disgusting superhero with blue blood that heals. He wields a radioactive mop that obliterates everything it touches. Obviously, this is not a movie that takes itself very seriously, and director Macon Blair clearly loves the source material. The problem is that the source material is a 1984 piece of middle-finger shlock that was clearly reacting to the bloat of 1980s film, and it's now 40 years later. When the original Toxic Avenger came out, superheroes were still anti-culture, and The Toxic Avenger fit into the cultural pantheon alongside other fuck-off cultural phenomenon like Spawn and Howard the Duck. But in our superhero-saturated age, we already have our gory, reactionary superhero property, The Boys, which has been doing the eviscerating and cutting off people's dicks and head exploding quite effectively for several seasons. The satire in The Boys is sharper, the writing is better and tighter and vaster, and the action is bigger-budgeted and more exciting. By comparison, The Toxic Avenger feels like a hard-R episode of Power Rangers or Ninja Turtles. That said, The Toxic Avenger has a sweet emotional core because of Toxie's love for his teenage stepson, played by the not-annoying former child star Jacob Tremblay. He also has a nice relationship with an investigative reporter who's out to expose Kevin Bacon's evil mob days and corporate rapaciousness. And while the superhero satire doesn't land, at all, the movie has an effective left-wing populist tone. Corporations are screwing us over and poisoning us. The health-care system is broken. And, in the movie's most effective set piece,"

Filmmaker and actor Macon Blair brings his own affection for the scrappy storytelling that delights itself in comedic distastefulness and shock value in the form of a reboot that reimagines the story at its core. Janitor Winston Gooze (Peter Dinklage) keeps his head down at work and against local baddies, while trying to form a bond with his step-son, Wade (Jacob Tremblay). When he's diagnosed with a terminal illness, he seeks help from his power-hungry BTH employer, Bob Garbinger (Kevin Bacon), who refuses to help pay for the expensive treatments. Winston's plan to rob the company backfires, resulting in his submersion in a vat of toxic waste, transforming him into a deformed creature with superhuman abilities. He decides to use them to fight back against corruption and evil. Blair's screenplay changes the point-of-view from an adolescent one to that of a full-grown man, abandoning Melvin's (Mark Torgl) yearning for attention from the cruel popular girls. He approaches The Toxic Avenger with an additional layer of commentary on capitalism, consumerism, and corruption, with a soft father-son story at its core. There are only a few of these scenes to develop their detached connection after the death of Wade's mother, which isn't enough time to develop the emotional connection it seeks to achieve. Alongside a familial story and a crime-fighting narrative is an investigative one. J.J. Doherty (Taylour Paige) seeks to put together the evidence to take down BTH, which Bob is willing to do anything to stop. Winston and J.J. are the central duo, traveling through the film's most absurd set pieces together. Together, they share the script's best gags, aside from the frequent use of off-screen ADR and minor jokes that actually warrant the biggest laughs. The Toxic Avenger tones down the derogatory humor a bit, but it still goes hard on the violence. There's a blend of practical effects and CGI to bring these scenes to life, spreading plenty of gore and guts across the screen. The hero carries a toxic mop with an upgrade from the original, serving as the primary weapon of destruction. Blair brings a star-studded cast aboard, who deliver personality to the remake. Dinklage is a solid Winston, navigating the tone quite well. Paige is The Toxic Avenger's secret weapon, playing the humor with a deadpan delivery that simply works. Bacon embraces the story's ludicrousness with glee. However, Tremblay and Elijah Wood are wasted talent on the screen. The Toxic Avenger is a remake that foolishly tries to reimagine Toxie's story by grounding the story's ridiculousness in an underbaked father-son story, while concocting lesser versions of scenes from the original. Blair clearly has a passion for the IP, as well as filmmaking as a whole, but this interpretation of the mop-wielding hero is lacking."

That film is The Toxic Avenger, and it's here to give all your favorite MCU and DC denizens a radioactive kick to the nuts. The Toxic Avenger reimagines independent film company Troma Entertainment's ultra-campy, ultra-violent 1984 cult classic of the same name. The original film sent up superhero tropes with mean-spirited glee, especially when it came to its protagonist: a nerdy janitor-turned-toxic monster. Now, director Macon Blair (I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore) looks to do something similar with his take on The Toxic Avenger  albeit in a very different media landscape. Despite slowly increasing fatigue from audiences, there's no doubt that superhero movies are a dominant culture force. And given that it is, by nature, a superhero movie, The Toxic Avenger inevitably finds itself walking the line between the big comic book films of today and its own countercultural roots. That tension is evident throughout the movie, right down to its production companies: Legendary Entertainment (which brought us The Dark Knight trilogy, the MonsterVerse, and Dune) and Troma itself. So what happens when you push the rebellious, bonkers, and often offensive energy of the original Toxic Avenger into a 2023 studio superhero flick? Gloriously bloody mayhem, for starters. Yet there is also the sense that The Toxic Avenger is holding itself back  and while that thankfully doesn't last too long, it recalls the restraint of other modern-day superhero films in a way that feels antithetical to The Toxic Avenger's madcap project. The Toxic Avenger's backstory hits some familiar beats before letting loose. Most of this restraint occurs in the first third of the movie as we first get to know the Toxic Avenger himself, aka Winston Gooze (Peter Dinklage). He's a down-on-his-luck janitor trying to connect with his stepson, Wade (Jacob Tremblay), who recently lost his mother to cancer. When Winston discovers he has a terminal illness and that his health insurance won't cover a crucial experimental treatment, he appeals directly to his boss, Bob Garbinger (Kevin Bacon), for help. The only problem? As his last name suggests, Bob is a garbage person. He heads up the sinister BTH corporation, which pollutes the town of St. Roma's Village with toxic waste and peddles carcinogenic wellness products to its customers. So, no, he has no desire to help a dying, low-level employee. A desperate Winston attempts to take matters into his own hands with a BTH robbery, but an unfortunate chemical accident at the factory leads to a toxic makeover. Armed with his hideous new looks and staggering new super strength, Winston teams up with investigative reporter J.J. Doherty (Taylour Paige) to destroy BTH once and for all. Between the evil boss, the father-son bonding, and the corporate vigilantism, The Toxic Avenger treads well-worn ground here. While these elements do provide higher emotional stakes for Winston, they also fit snugly"

Kabukiman NYPD, and its cracked crown jewel, The Toxic Avenger. But once in a while, the independent film distributor still strikes gold. While the latest version of The Toxic Avenger  made in partnership with Dune and MonsterVerse studio Legendary and dubbed ""not a remake"" by star Peter Dinklage  isn't in the same league of modern-day Troma triumph as 2018's delightfully weird Mutant Blast, there are still some quality ingredients in its radioactive sludge. The new film follows Dinklage's Winston, who struggles to be a supportive stepfather to young Wade, played by Jacob Tremblay. Winston's life outside the house is pretty simple on the face of things: He's a janitor at mega-company BTH, just trying to keep his nose clean and maintain order in his corner of the world following the loss of Wade's mother. Everything changes when Winston discovers he has an undetermined brain problem that will lead to his own death in less than a year. If that feels like a lot of exposition for a film that eventually transforms Winston into a mutant who smashes his way through wrongdoers, that's because it is. And, unfortunately, it isn't even all of it: The Toxic Avenger takes a considerable amount of time to get rolling. To say it starts to fire on all cylinders once it gets there would be too kind, but it does, at the very least, improve. When the film is relying on practical bloodshed and mutilation, it's quite fun! The Toxic Avenger  affectionately referred to by fans as ""Toxie""  rips through bad guys in an attempt to win his son over, but quickly finds himself wrapped up in a larger conspiracy between BTH, the mob, and BTH whistleblower/budding vigilante J.J. Doherty (Taylour Paige). As the stakes rise, so does the body count, but there's a misguided decision to use CGI blood in some pivotal scenes. And here's the thing: CGI blood never looks good, but it looks downright awful compared to The Toxic Avenger's otherwise-practical mayhem. The move is especially confusing given that it costs more  and it feels impossible that the majority of the film's budget wasn't spent on its surprisingly stacked cast. J.J. and Wade are welcome additions to Toxie's world, playing the proverbial straight men amidst the tutu-clad, mop-swinging crime fighter and Kevin Bacon's evil CEO Bob Garbinger. The hero and villain play off of each other wonderfully, and Dinklage and Bacon clearly had a blast with writer-director Macon Blair's shenanigan-filled script. They're also joined by Elijah Wood in the role of Bob's little brother Fritz  a henchman who looks like something between The Penguin and Gollum. There's even a cameo from Jane Lynch, Wood's co-star in Blair's previous feature, I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore. Memorable faces can be a welcome change when making the shift from Troma's typically DIY productions, but sometimes that extra"

Macon Blair (I Don't Feel At Home in This World Anymore, Hold the Dark) took on both writing and directing duties to reimagine the cult classic 80's film originally conceived by Lloyd Kaufman and Joe Ritter. In Blair's rendition, a janitor trying to make ends meet working for a corrupt pharmaceutical company while being the sole caregiver for his step-son finds himself in a difficult situation that lands him in a pool of toxic waste. Lucky for the janitor, instead of killing him the waste transforms him into a grotesque, super-human hero for the working man able to seek vengeance on those who have wronged him. I must first be up-front and let you all know I have not seen the original 1984 version of The Toxic Avenger, therefore I have no basis for comparison while discussing Blair's version. That being said, I had an absolute blast with Blair's The Toxic Avenger. It manages to perfectly balance so many different, often opposing elements in a cohesive and entertaining way. At the core of this film is the story of a man simply trying to do the right thing for the son of the woman he loved, who tragically died. Because this teenage boy isn't his son, or even technically his step-son, the relationship is often awkward, but there is also clearly a strong bond. There is also a story of corporate corruption and greed. Our protagonist works for this corporation as a janitor, making almost no money and having the worst health insurance while the CEO lives a lavish lifestyle that quite literally costs the lives of his employees and customers. These two themes make it apparent to the audience that the stakes are high and that the story is heart-felt, relatable, and relevant to today's world. What gives The Toxic Avenger its signature Troma Entertainment flair is the absolutely outrageous humor. It's a type of humor that won't appeal to all audiences, but it definitely tickled this film critic's funny bone. The humor is goofy, silly, and could even be described as infantile. Yet because this type of humor is combined with the more heartfelt and serious themes previously mentioned, it strikes a nice balance that works well with the plot. Some minor plot points and characters might not make the most sense, creating more than a few ""wtf"" moments, but because the entire film is pure insanity these points are easy to laugh off. In some of the previous Troma films I've seen, I often feel that the humor goes a bit too far. This is not the case with The Toxic Avenger, which goes to some pretty crazy places, but never to a place that comes across as offensive, and this is likely due to Blair's skills both as a writer and a director. Another aspect of The Toxic Avenger that makes it feel very much like"
221,UUT_Doc1_Equilibrium,UUT_Doc1_Equilibrium,UUT,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"Since originally debuting at the 2022 SXSW Film Festival back in March, Everything Everywhere All at Once has become one of the most anticipated films of the first half of this year. Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, better known simply as ""Daniels"", made their big-screen debut six years ago with the Daniel Radcliffe comedy Swiss Army Man, a movie overlooked by many viewers. Personally, I was fascinated by the strangely captivating mix of a flatulent corpse and the emotional aspects of the screenplay. Since then, the bizarre duo hasn't made a new feature film, until now... I hope we don't have to wait another six years for their third flick because Everything Everywhere deserves all the hype its generated over the last month. From the premise involving hundreds of multiverses and different versions of the protagonist, Evelyn Wang, to the overwhelming editing and visuals, this movie shouldn't work as well as it does. Conceptually it should be confusing, too complex, and challenging for viewers to form a strong bond with the main character and her family. However, The Daniels demonstrate their immense talent as writer-directors in preventing any of this from happening. Not only do they never lose focus on narrative, but they also embrace chaos as the engine of the whole film. One of the most surprising aspects of the script is linked to the film's exposition. Everything Everywhere has an extremely relevant set of rules, technology, and small details that need to be simplified into understandable explanations for the public. With tremendous creativity and assertiveness, The Daniels put viewers on the same page as the protagonist, with every question and revelation about the multiverse and everything it entails being interpreted by the character in the same manner as the audience. Without an exceptionally effective first act, the entire story of this movie would fall into an endless spiral of narrative doubts and frustrations, negatively affecting the overall entertainment value. Witty comedy is another vital characteristic of Everything Everywhere that helps viewers stay captivated throughout the runtime. Whether in family interactions, with store customers, or blended with the insane action, the humor results in numerous burst-out-laughing moments. In this regard, Asian-American viewers will be able to find even more details worthy of a good laugh or smile as The Daniels depict the immigrant family's life with great pride and authenticity. Michelle Yeoh contributes significantly to this last point, playing the dozens  or even hundreds  of Evelyns impressively. Everything Everywhere also ends up becoming a meaningful tribute to the actress. Yeoh's facial and body expressiveness elevate every line of dialogue, but honestly, it's her physical prowess that will leave viewers in absolute awe. At nearly 60 years old, the actress manages to perform most of her own stunts, all with shocking elegance and dedication. And it's not simple choreography, with only one or two fighting partners. These are excruciatingly long sequences, with outstanding execution of intricate, violent attack-defense movements. In fact, action is yet another area where The"

While juggling a tax audit, a visiting judgmental father and multiple family crises around the Lunar New Year, Evelyn discovers that she is the savior of the multiverse. Writers and directors the Daniels' surreal sophomore feature following 2016's ""Swiss Army Man"" succeeds in blending sci-fi, action, horror and comedy without neglecting the heart of the story: finding meaning in life through love and kindness to others. The immigrant, the laundry lady, the bureaucrat and the desexualized Asian man often appear in the margins of other films. The Daniels' elevation of them is a beautiful way to honor unsung pillars of society. They turned their moms and dads into flawed heroes, while the audit and the threat to the multiverse serve the same function of forcing Evelyn to assess her life and decide if she wants to stay the course, change or give up. It creates the possibility of redemption and renewal for her as an individual and as the family's hand, a part of the sandwich generation. By healing herself in this epic journey, she can heal generational trauma. Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, ""The Goonies""), Evelyn's husband and the heart of the family, complains that Evelyn's attention gets pulled to other tasks before they can connect. The movie depicts Evelyn as being yanked out of her 'verse and into other Evelyns, unable to engage without distractions. Depending on the universe she visits, Waymond can be a seductive Wong Kar-wai leading man or an action hero. The Daniels' countercultural depiction of gentle masculinity ranks up there with Mister Rogers, but even in his silliest incarnation, Waymond holds the key to helping Evelyn become the hero and stopping the Big Bad, Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu). The genre mashup provides a fuller insight into the characters' personalities than a straight independent film could depict. The multiverse is a metaphor for the different facets of peoples' potential and makes their internal lives literal. Even though Jobu Tupaki is this film's Thanos, the real villain is despair in the face of nihilism. If Evelyn represents failed hopes and dreams, Jobu Tupaki is the consummate success, given her seamless navigation of each 'verse  a gift from a genius scientist that also breaks her mind and spirit. Even abuse with good intentions is too high a cost for omnipotence, and the Daniels convey that achieving perfection should never be prioritized over nurturing, which is a theme that should strike a chord with first-generation Americans with immigrant parents who prioritized survival at a high psychological cost. The film models how to begin to mend broken souls and relationships; thus, saving the world. The Daniels use bleak, bland office spaces as the backdrop for tense, epic battles, reminiscent of films such as ""Mayhem"" (2017) and ""The Belko Experiment"" (2016).

However, when you picture the vast creativity that the concept of numerous spawning dimensions crossing a singular reality can inspire, few films are as successful or are as joyous as the emotionally poignant A24 movie  Everything Everywhere All at Once. Directed and written by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film that can only really be described as bizarrely perfect. It is an action movie with clever and charming writing, stunning visuals, tongue and cheek jokes, and impressive performances from a talented cast that includes the likes of Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. Following a Chinese immigrant Evelyn (Yeoh), and her family, the movie disguises itself as a normal drama in its opening sequences, before thrusting audiences into a spectacular sci-fi adventure. Evelyn is a woman who is dissatisfied; she has a strained relationship with her sweet husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), struggles to communicate with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), and her laundromat is on the verge of bankruptcy. In the first 20 minutes of the film, we see Evelyn disillusioned and unhappy with her life. However, soon we witness the character's mental state shift to pure confusion once her husband starts acting like a different person and declares that she is in danger. Here the film immediately shifts tone as we witness a scenario that feels reminiscent of classic science fiction movies, such as Sarah Connor in The Terminator or Neo in The Matrix. In short, Evelyn is revealed to be somewhat of a 'chosen one'. She must learn to connect with multiple universes, harnessing the skills that 'other Evelyns' have gained in their worlds to help save her family and the fabric of reality itself.Everything Everywhere All at Once knows how to craft an entertaining journey through its exhilarating cinematography, choreographed fight sequences, and shocking creativity. As we see unthought-of universes through Evelyn's adventures, such as one where everyone has hotdog fingers, you can see that Kwan and Scheinert had fun with and subsequently put a lot of effort into the multiverse concept of the movie.Each new addition, each new Evelyn that we meet, perfectly fits into the comedic and surreal atmosphere of the film. The flick isn't afraid to lean into pop culture, self-referential callbacks, or the camp of its otherworldly and random scenarios, making it enduring and just plain fun at times. You can never predict what will happen next in this movie, and as time goes on, you also can't help but appreciate how the fun narrative becomes more existential and nihilistic in its message.At the heart of this bizarre and gloriously messy adventure is a simple story about familial relationships and dealing with the boredom of reality vs the dreams and expectations you once had when you were younger.

How about a middle-aged Asian-American woman failing as a wife and mother? Her name is Evelyn, and she's the unlikely hero of Everything Everywhere All at Once, the mind-bending action-comedy written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinerts, collectively known as the Daniels. Heavily influenced by The Matrix, Kill Bill and the films of Wong Kar-Wai, and with enough exposition to put Christopher Nolan to shame, the Daniels have created a subversive take on the chosen-one narrative that takes place across an infinite expanse of parallel universes. In a hilarious bit of bad timing, while Evelyn and her husband Waymond are at an IRS office trying to negotiate their way out of legal jeopardy, Waymond is abruptly taken over by Alpha-Waymond. Alpha-Waymond is from the Alphaverse, so named because it's the first 'verse to create 'verse-jumping technology, which allow its inhabitants to move between parallel realities by temporarily taking over the bodies of their alternate universe counterparts. Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn how wise choices act like the cosmic equivalent of compounding interest, leading to rich and fulfilling lives. In Evelyn's case, poor choices at every important juncture have made her the worst possible version of all of her multidimensional selves. But that's precisely why Alpha-Waymond contacted her; as a complete failure, Evelyn has the greatest amount of potential, so he believes only she can stop Jobu Tupaki, an Alphaverse renegade seemingly bent on destroying the entire multiverse. In order to combat Jobu Tupaki and legions of 'verse-jumping warriors, Alpha-Waymond gives Evelyn a pair of earbuds that provide access to whatever skills she might need from her infinite number of parallel selves. The hyperkinetic transitions depicting a kaleidoscope of alternate universes deserve to have seizure warnings, but the Daniels do a commendable job of balancing mayhem with tender moments. Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan as Evelyn and Waymond, along with Stephanie Hsu as their estranged young adult daughter Joy, give whirlwind performances that cycle between intricate martial arts choreography and tear-jerking family drama, often while in service of absurdist comedy. To give you an idea of just how absurd, their family name of Wang foreshadows one of the film's most outrageous set pieces  a battle involving giant rubber dildos. Such irreverence should come as no surprise considering the Daniels' debut feature, Swiss Army Man, has a plot that revolves around a flatulating corpse. But with a runtime that approaches two and a half hours, the unbridled craziness and visual fireworks can be exhausting, especially the dragged-out climax where the Daniels struggle to resolve no less than six alternate universe plot threads. At press time, Everything Everywhere All at Once has pretty much won everything everywhere, from Writer, Director, Producer and Screen Actor Guild awards to the Independent Spirit Awards, and it looks poised to win tons of gold statuettes at the 95th Academy Awards.

With the onslaught of Marvel films, various franchises, and sequels abound...it isn't everyday that we bear witness to a truly eccentric masterpiece of cinema. And yet, even set against a backdrop of box office failures and very little surprises in 2022, audiences have been given a gift of triumphant proportions in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once."" Early in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" we meet laundromat owner Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) who is seemingly down on her luck as she prepares for an audit of her taxes with the IRS. We are introduced to a cast of characters that includes Evelyn's husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), elderly father Gong Gong (James Hong), as well as patrons of their failing establishment. Evelyn's husband doesn't take life too seriously, while her daughter is a disappointment in Evelyn's eyes. At the IRS, Evelyn is confronted with a sudden change in her husband's demeanor, as he quickly walks her through steps to take in order to change her perception of the events that will soon occur. Gifted with these written instructions, Evelyn decides what to do as she is presented with dire consequences from the IRS Agent (Jamie Lee Curtis) that is assigned to her case. Reviewing the strange instructions once more, she switches her shoes to the wrong feet, imagines that she's in the IRS janitor's closet, then presses the green button on a bluetooth-like device her ""husband"" gave her to wear in her ears. Here's where the fun begins. Evelyn suddenly jumps into the janitor's closet, the first of many jumps she will take for the better part of the day. A newer version of Waymond joins her in the closet, and he describes the multiverse in great detail. There are other versions of Evelyn that exist in other universes, including a fighter, a famous singer, and an actress. She is presented with the idea that every distraction, every disappointment has led these versions to where they are in their lives. Everyone Evelyn loves is in danger from a malevolent force named Jobu Tupaki, and it's up to Evelyn to save the world by traversing the other universes that are joining with the lives she could have led. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is stunningly original, funny, thought-provoking and incredibly effective. Every character that is introduced by writer/directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively named ""The Daniels"") in the first twenty minutes of the film has a purpose to Evelyn's mission, which is often demonstrated by their ability to jump from one universe to the next. There are also ridiculous situations that every character finds themselves in, which includes butt plugs, dildos, hot dogs for fingers, kung fu fighting, orange soda, bug sniffing, and bagels.

At one point, she tries to offer her daughter a few loving words. She stammers for a moment. 'You need to eat healthier food,' she says at last. 'You're getting fat.' But while Evelyn is on her way to meet with the IRS, she receives an urgent message from another reality. The multiverse is in danger: a great evil is spreading from world to world, destroying everything it touches, and only she can stop it. Why? Because she has failed to fulfil her dreams more times than anyone else in any universe. Which means there are more alternate versions of her than anyone else, living better lives she never lived  which means she can travel to their universes, absorb their powers, and save the infinite worlds. This is a fun idea, and it sets up some entertaining comedy kung fu set pieces, but it feels uncomfortable. This film can't quite commit to its interdimensional-war gimmick; it's an appendage, mostly played for laughs, to the real story, which I kept waiting to arrive  and when it did, I wished it hadn't. We end up spending very little time exploring these alternate Evelyns, or the spectral sadness of what could have been, or even the full imaginative potential of the multiverse. Instead, if you strip away the sci-fi elements and cut the film down to its narrative core, this is a story about a repressed, neurotic woman who finally learns to open up emotionally to her family. In Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon writes, basically apropos of nothing, that 'there is nothing so loathsome as a sentimental surrealist.' He wasn't wrong. Everyone knows that mass culture is out of ideas: the cinemas are crawling with sequels, franchises, cinematic universes; the same warmed-over crap, over and over again. No wonder studios are turning to the multiverse: the concept is a ready-made stand-in for having lots of interesting new ideas. But the idea of an idea isn't enough. Without any actual creative substance, we end up falling back on family-values schlock. There are exceptions, but they're brief. Possibly the best scene in Everything Everywhere All At Once takes Evelyn to a universe where life never emerged on our planet, where she is a rock on the edge of a barren cliff. The scene is slow and quiet and genuinely very funny."
227,UUT_Doc7_Equilibrium,UUT_Doc7_Equilibrium,UUT,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"Oh man. I love splashy, willfully bizarre movies where people's emotional state is signified by the color of their feather boas. I am extremely down for pastiche, and for stories of racial and sexual minorities. I loved the acting, esp Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, and even Stephanie Hsu despite the fact that she's given exactly one lugubrious note to play. A lot of the ingredients of this film should have worked for me. Instead I just think it is not good. You know how with Losing Ground I was like, ""You might vibe with it though,"" and I know that sounded like a cop-out, but actually I did mean that other people might see things in the movie that I missed? Intellectually I know that might also be true of EEAAO but in my heart, I know I'm right: no. There are basically three problems here imho, and all of them are huge. The thing I noticed first is that every single emotion and thought gets explained. It is all talked out! And in the most prosaic terms. It's like one of those awful contemporary musicals where the lyrics are like, ""When you ignore me/Then I get mad!/Because anger is my coping mechanism/When I feel sad."" Justin Chang says the movie ""practically does all your emoting for you,"" and even that understates what happens here. We're never given a chance to intuit the plot elements, just told, ""I think when she does something strange, she can jump to another universe!"" (or whatever the line is, I didn't take notes.) We're never given a chance to intuit relationships and emotions, just told, ""You made your daughter into your enemy by putting too much pressure on her."" Shut up and let your story breathe!!! The second thing is that the film tells so many stories that it often ends up gesturing at emotional resonancecreating a resolution that should make me feel something, so I try to feel the thing, but I'm just not there because these specific characters have speed-walked through the outline of a story rather than telling a story. The rescue of Raccacoonie, the love between the hot-dog finger ladies, these are not stories but synopses; and so what I feel is not the real emotion but a memory of feeling this emotion in response to other, better movies. And the third thing is that the movie explains its philosophy at length and it is, ""Nothing matters so be kind."" Like... okay. I've spent a fair amount of time on internet forums where sad lonely people try to understand how to keep going when they don't believe that life has meaning, and I know that many things that aren't persuasive to me can be life-saving insights for someone else. But the philosophy in EEAAO struck me as noticeably more banal than anything people on these forums have said to one another in encouragement. Maybe because EEAAO doesn't really grapple with the problem that lots of people have tried"

First, to rewind, digest, get one's head around the whole whirlwind absurdist world of it. EEAAO is, at its core, two tales  an immigrant's tale and a coming out story, merging into one  the story of an outsider finding solace in the imaginal  as the banality of the real is so tremendously soul-crushing. Evelyn Wang, acted with perfect-pitch by the excellent Michelle Yeoh, left China for America a few decades ago, and is running a laundromat business that is slowly going under. Mostly, due to her messy bookkeeping practices and a doggedly no-nonsense IRS agent, called Deidre (a hilariously believable Jamie Lee Curtis), who aims to get to the bottom of the haphazard pile of receipts, and penalise the flakey Evelyn. A woman who deducts as expenses her many 'hobbies', all under the umbrella of her business, subconsciously keeping afloat and alive the many possible paths in life she would have wanted to have experienced, but never did. Evelyn's loyal husband, Waymond Wang, played by the bubbly Ke Huy Quan, whom she eloped to the US with, is on the verge of divorcing her, his own visions of the future dashed, as he is no longer (if he ever was) her romantic leading man. Evelyn's daughter, Joy (an earnest Stephanie Hsu), never feeling good enough for her over-critical mom, and knowing that being gay will possibly always be a problem in her traditional family, tries to find ways to merge her worlds, without much luck, and with growing heartbreak. There is also the visiting grandad (acting legend James Hong), almost as an ancestor spirit, omnipresent in judgment, but lacking in any kind of constructive agency. And then, a strange thing happens on the way to the the tax office. Universes collide, alternate identities are revealed, Waymond becomes Alpha-Waymond from the Alphaverse (kudos for the alpha pun), and Evelyn learns of her exceptional destiny as the One who will defeat darkness, presently spreading throughout all levels of existence, all at once. Problem is, this evil has taken the form of her own estranged daughter, who the Alpha-Evelyn in the Alphaverse pushed too hard to jump verses. Lost in sorrow, Joy has now become not only joy-less, but the key agent of chaos in the entire Multiverse, constructing a black hole of nothingness, out of a sesame-poppy-seed-everything bagel, no less, after filling it with a ratatouille of earthly existence. In order to save Joy (exorcise her, really), and remove the threat of the now alpha grandad eliminating her, Evelyn needs to gather the strength and knowhow of all the roads she never took, the lives she never"
229,UUT_Doc9_Equilibrium,UUT_Doc9_Equilibrium,UUT,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"These days, it seems, Everything Everywhere All at Once is everywhere  and all at once. The sci-fi juggernaut about a laundromat owner who learns she has countless other selves existing in an infinite number of parallel universes has racked up a Titanic-class boatload of awards and is on track to be an Oscars night behemoth. I kind of hate it. Smugly proud of its in-your-face cleverness; poundingly frenetic in its storytelling; the film keeps applying defibrillator paddles to its exhausted narrative when, in reality, it has no heart to begin with. I know it's kind of late to be weighing in on the movie that, in a few days, may well sweep the Oscars (It's got 11 nominations, including Best Picture). Everything Everywhere All at Once premiered way back in April 2022  and as such is an Oscars rarity: A movie that opened early in the year yet kept its bandwagon rolling all the way into the Awards Season. That week, I chose to review Aline  a spectacularly quirky Canadian musical/biography of Celine Dion  simply because I liked it better, and I've always felt the valuable real estate of this column is best-used pointing readers to movies they will actually enjoy. I stand by that editorial choice: I'm not sure I'd want to sit through Aline a second time, but I do know I'm sorry I'll never get back the 2 hours and 19 minutes I spent enduring Everything Everywhere All at Once. For one thing, can we all agree the Parallel Universe Genre is played out? Frank Capra got away with it in It's a Wonderful Life, it was cute in Sliding Doors, but then The Butterfly Effect started taking it seriously, and before long TV's Rick and Morty was making it a weekly thing. Enough already. Like time travel, parallel universes have become the refuge of uninspired screenwriters. The parlor trick of parallel universe movies is to make all the loose ends meet up for the finale. That can be readily accomplished, I can tell you as a writer, by constructing the whole thing backwards  knowing where you are going to end up and then sending your various threads of reality hurtling off into disparate beginnings. That's the easy part. Once you've created all those incarnations of a character, the challenge is in making your audience actually care about them. And this is where Everything Everywhere All at Once comes up short. Michelle Yeoh is remarkable as Evelyn Wang  and all her variations  but once the film establishes that there are infinite versions of Evelyn, it's tough to become attached to any of them. After all, one Evelyn is just as good as any other; just different. As an IRS auditor who is also a monster from another dimension, Jamie Lee Curtis gives the film's most gratifying performance, skillfully revealing the soft side of an initially caustic character  offering the charming possibility that there may be infinite versions of each"
230,UUT_Doc10_Equilibrium,UUT_Doc10_Equilibrium,UUT,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"The enthusiasm for A24's latest ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" has been deafening, with early reactions ranging from high praise to full-blown hyperbole. Admittedly, that has made keeping my own personal expectations in check a little difficult. On one hand A24 is a distributor with a tremendous track record when it comes to releasing bold original independent movies. On the other hand, first-takes can be a hard thing to gauge, and they can sometimes resemble trendy groupthink rather than original reactions. After some initial worry, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" has finally made its way to our market. And while I appreciate much of what it's going for, the movie ended up being a tough sit. Without question, the film is an ambitious undertaking for the co-writing and co-directing duo of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (who collectively refer to themselves as ""Daniels""). Unfortunately their ambition often gives way to overindulgence making this overlong and overstuffed genre stew a well-meaning but exhausting experience. The film's biggest plus is easily Michelle Yeoh. She's long been a terrific actress and here she fully commits 110%. She truly is the movie's anchor and her role demands a ton emotionally, physically, and even comedically. It's pretty amazing watching Yeoh tie all of those threads together especially considering how erratic the movie can get at times. Blunt stylistic choices and some particularly wild attempts at humor make things needlessly messy, yet Yeoh never misses a beat.Yeoh's character Evelyn is the story's centerpiece. When she was young, Evelyn ran off and married Waymond (Key Huy Quan) much to the chagrin of her disapproving parents. These days the couple own and run a neighborhood laundromat and live in small apartment right above it. The movie begins with Evelyn chugging through her hectic yet mundane existence. ""Laundry and taxes"" is her life in a nutshell as she and Waymond struggle to keep their laundromat afloat while preparing for an audit by the IRS. Meanwhile Evelyn's elderly father (James Hong) is set to pay a visit and her rebellious daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) wants to introduce him to her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel). But knowing what her old-fashioned father's reaction will be, Evelyn hides it, souring her relationship with her daughter even more. This forms one of the movie's central themes  a mother reconnecting with her daughter after bucking her 'old ways' of thinking. It's all pretty on-the-nose and it's not hard to figure out how things are going to play out. The only real suspense is in how chaotic things will get in between. The craziness kicks in when Evelyn is contacted by a Waymond from another universe. Call him Alpha Waymond and through a string of long never-ending exposition drops he explains to Evelyn (and us) the rules of this movie's world. Over time Alpha Waymond rattles on about ""infinite multiverses"", ""bringing balance"", and even a line about Evelyn being ""the One"" (all obvious nods to ""Star Wars"", ""The Matrix"", and the MCU).

Even passages of his very first Evil Dead were informed as much by the Three Stooges as by George A. Romero, and his approach to the tenets of screen fear have only become more playful with time. So his latest is not the ultimate experience in grueling terror that some might be expecting or hoping forbut it is a Hell of a lot of fun.You can see a bit of the Stooges here in several moments of cranial abuse with assorted found objects, and one key sequence is so Evil Dead II that it only lacks someone screeching, ""I'll swallow your soul!"" In fact, Raimi gleefully mixes influences from throughout horror history, juxtaposing shadow-on-the-wall creepiness of the type dating back to the original Nosferatu with up-to-the-minute gross-outs that assure this PG-13 release will still satisfy his staunchest devotees. The director's old motto of ""The gore the merrier"" may not be strictly followed, but ""Slime's no crime"" is very much in evidence.The bulk of that effluvia is spewed from the mouth etc. of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an elderly gypsy woman who puts a whammy on bank worker Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) after Christine denies her a third extension on her mortgage payment. Christine's been trying to impress her pitiless boss, Jim Jacks (played by David Paymer and evidently named after Raimi's A Simple Plan and The Gift producer, for reasons that will probably have to wait for the audio commentary), by showing that she can harden her heart and make the tough decisions too, but this one turns out to be tougher than she thought. After a subsequent encounter with Mrs. Ganush in a parking garage that requires her to make inappropriate use of a stapler, Christine learns that she has been cursed, and is fated to experience horrible apparitions and violent assaults for three days before being conveyed to the hot place.The setup thus set up, Raimi (who scripted with his brother Ivan) uses it as a jumping-off point to subject his heroine to all sorts of torment, with tongue firmly in cheek when it's not slobbering all over poor Christine. Her fiance Clay (Justin Long) tries to be supportive but doesn't quite believe and isn't much help, so she seeks assistance from fortune teller Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), who might be able to assist her as long as she's got the cash. Neither a helpless damsel in distress nor an exaggerated tough chick, Christine, as played very well by Lohman, is a sympathetic heroine and viewer surrogate, a vessel for anyone's worries about worst-case scenarios after slighting the wrong stranger. (The fact that the movie's instigating incident is well-timed to the current housing crisis seems more like a happy accident.)Of course, it's unlikely that much of what transpires in Drag Me to Hell"
232,XYW_Doc2_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW_Doc2_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW,Horror,Positive,Drag_me_to_hell,"Though he's commonly cited for his alleged overabundance of technique and whirly-twirly flourishes, as a filmmaker Sam Raimi is for the most part anything but excessive, as Drag Me to Hell proves time and again. Especially in light of the sadistic strain of American horror films in recent years, which latch onto a concept or even just an image, and hit it over and over again with dull defeatism (Hostel, 28 Weeks Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake, The Strangers) Raimi's new movie seems particularly elegant, tight, and as consistent in its own logic as these sorts of things can be. Nearly everything in Drag, save some awkwardly jutting dream sequences, just fitseven its many jokey asides act not as non sequiturs but as fully integrated responses to plot points. As many might say, this is a ""lean, mean scream machine,"" and though that term connotes mechanical precision (and it's something you could never call the Evil Dead films, which were made up of random parts sticking out at weird angles, with Bruce Campbell's Monty Python deadpan only serving to create bigger gaps between its laughs and its scares), in this film's case such fastidiousness serves a purpose. Unlike his earlier trilogywhose portal-to-another-world hokum was just one generation more coherent than Dario Argento's extra-cruddy witch-book narratives in Suspiria and InfernoDrag Me to Hell functions on the level of an EC Comics morality tale from the crypt: character-fueled, cause-and-effect, and glib. As such, it requires a steadier hand, and with his career-honed skills, Raimi is now able to remind us of the pleasures of classical horror. Where with the Evil Dead films, for all their ingenuity and visual imagination, Raimi often came across as a kid hyperactively showing you his collection of rubber skeletons and monster-movie memorabilia, now he provides the right emotional context for his gallery of grotesqueswithout sacrificing the humor. Also crucial to the success of Drag Me to Hell is Alison Lohman, who as deceptively docile protagonist Christine Brown, is onscreen for nearly the entire running time, all of which she invests with palpable desperation, terror, and just the right dollop of knowing absurdity (a Bruce Campbell type, with his detached bemusement, is unthinkable here). A plausible human being in a genre that too often merely sets up characters for the butcher block, the perfectly but unpretentiously primped Christine is a loan officer gritting her teeth as she waits out a significant promotion at the bank. (Any critic susceptible to the folly of trying to locate ""relevant"" contemporary fears in every horror film that comes down the pike can read what they will into such serendipitous subject matter, and make whatever connections they want to the mortgage crisis, but the realities of Christine's work can only earn an appreciate shrug before we move on to grottier matters.) In angling for a new title and pay raiseand looking out for her main competition, Stu, played by Reggie Lee with just enough corporate unctuousnessChristine needs to prove her mettle"

And while Evil Dead II remains one of my all time favorite movies, the magic just isn't there for Drag Me to Hell. I watched these scenes play out with masterful execution, but instead of laughing or smiling I just rolled my eyes. And, I hate to say it, but I almost think I would have liked Drag Me to Hell a lot more if it played more of its moments straight or even (God I hate to say this) more conventionally. I don't know. I really don't. I'm at a loss with this movie. And to make matters worse, the film's premise all but guarantees the stock scene that I absolutely despise. The one where Character A (Christine, in this case) attends a social gathering and is aware of something no other character is receptive to (in this case, the Lamia spirit screwing with her mind.) Every single genre calls upon this scene, but horror and comedy draw from this well every chance it can cram one in. And I'm hard-pressed to think of many instances where it A. did not reek of artificiality B. served any purpose beyond getting all the actors to make funny faces. If you're going to shatter the walls of believability, fine. But, for God's sake, do it over something interesting to watch. Blow something up. Stab something. I don't care. There's better reasons to have actors raise their eyebrows. So, I watched this dinner scene with no investment while Christine tries to ignore the loud noises she hears, the blood and eyeballs she sees in her cake, until the inevitable breakdown when she throws her glass and screams atop her lungs and everyone else stares at her. And like every other instance, while the weirdness escalates I think to myself, ""You know, I've used the 'I have a headache; I need to go lay down' excuse for much, much, much less than that."" Why doesn't anyone ever make up BS excuses and excuse themselves? And, again, Raimi does what he can to inject freshness into this overused scene. Most directors are content to leave the weirdness at the eyeball and blood oozing from the cake, but Raimi goes the step further and has the cake swallow up Christine's fork. And there is something charming about how Christine looks down, then at the other people at the table, and actually laughs. A subtle crazy ""someone just shoot me now"" laugh. And when Christine sees and hears the Lamia on the verge of breaking the door down, as Raimi rapidly cuts to crazy tilted angles and ever moving cameras, I dare you to find a more energized sequence in your average summer blockbuster. And there's the dilemma. Drag Me to Hell does what it does well. Damn well. It knows it's poking fun at crappy movie conventions; it indulges in cliches to take aim at them and mock"
234,XYW_Doc4_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW_Doc4_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW,Horror,Positive,Drag_me_to_hell,"Sam Raimi is one of those directors with a very distinctive style. At his best, whether working on big-budget spectaculars like Spider Man 2 or tiny cult films like Evil Dead II, his movies give off a high-octane kinetic vibe. Even his worst movies are wall-to-wall energy, that breeze by regardless of the running time. You can complain about too many villains, too much going on, and downright stupid decision in, say, Spider Man 3, but one thing even a bad Raimi movies does not have is dead weights and dull moments. In Drag Me to Hell, Sam Raimi and Peter Deming provide great interesting images which are fun, even mesmerizing, to look at. Bob Murawski's dynamic editing matches the energy that Deming's camera infuses in the frame. Between Raimi's directing, Deming's photography, and Murawski's editing, Drag Me to Hell has an absolutely flawless rhythm. Action sequences breeze by with remarkable clarity that Michael Bay's Transformers series can only dream about. When Christine stabs the Gypsy in the mouth with the nearest weapon (a ruler), it goes to a medium shot and lingers just long enough for the horror and comedy to sink in, and then the fight resumes with an adrenal vengeance. They say good editing is editing that you don't notice (because you don't want it to draw attention to itself and get in the way of the story.) Towards the end of the film in the cemetery, after Christine has given the curse to a soul who already passed on, she turns to climb out of the open grave and we see the same turn three times at different distances ... and somehow (I'll be damned if I can say how) this stylish decision felt so natural, so organic, I didn't even notice it until trying to grab a frame. And the musichow I adore the musicChristopher Young is a composer I've long admired. Over the opening credits we here a violin concerto that sounds like it's spinning an intricate melodic web; Christine receives a simple but heart-melting piano theme that breathes the very essence of innocence and sweetness, and evolves to soul-wrenching sadness later on in the film as the Lamia closes in on Christine's soul. And, Young, no stranger to horror scores, unsettles those creepy scenes of empty garages, dark houses, with typical long dissonant notes from the Strings section of the orchestra, and I particularly liked the gypsy undertones and creative use of ambient sounds. Horror scores rarely provide ""casual listening"" music as they're designed to put people on edge, but the better ones are often fascinating to listen to from a technical point of view (in a music theory sense). Drag Me to Hell contains the best of both worlds. Lastly, the actors, their characters, and their chemistry. Central to a movie of this nature is the sympathies for the protagonist, and Christine Brown is one of the most sympathetic character I've seen on film. We meet her as she drives to work,"
235,XYW_Doc5_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW_Doc5_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW,Horror,Positive,Drag_me_to_hell,"With the new Evil Dead almost upon us, I figured I would post my old review of one of the best horror films of recent years, Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell. I loved this film when it came out and continue to do so. My best recommendation, by the way, is to watch the PG-13 cut as opposed to the unrated, as it is surprisingly better. Regardless, this movie is a blast to watch, especially for Sam Raimi-style horror fans. An old fashioned, original horror movie from director Sam ""blame the studios, not me, for Venom"" Raimi. This movie was a fucking blast. Its incredibly entertaining, managing to actually be scary as well as provide plenty of offbeat humor for which the man behind Evil Dead has been known for. Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a loan officer at a bank, hoping for an assistant manager position, as long as the pesky brown noser Stu (Reggie Lee) doesn't get in the way. She has her chance to prove herself when a gypsy women enters the bank requesting a third extension on her loan. Christine denies the gypsy women a bank loan, which becomes the biggest mistake of her life. After a parking lot brawl pitting a young woman against an old one (with many creative ways for them to one-up each other), Christine soon finds that she has been cursed, with three days of torment to deal with before finally being dragged down to hell. Of course, if she can find anyway to stop this, she will go for it. With the help of her loving yet skeptical boyfriend, played by a straight-man version of Justin Long, and a couple of psychics, Christine has to get through all of her suffering before she can hopefully find a way to rid herself of the curse. If one thinks about the Evil Dead films, than saying that this is an original film may be a term used a little more relatively. This is the closest we may ever be to seeing Evil Dead 4. Every trademark that Raimi built himself up with in that horror trilogy is present here. The manic camera work, tilted angles, whiplash inducing editing, creeks & bumps and other oddities created through sound effects, buckets of different disgusting types of liquids, and of course the physical punishment of the lead character. While Bruce Campbell may not be present this time around, Alison Lohman is more than game to set herself into the punishing world of a Raimi protagonist. She is doused with all kinds of stuff, enduring all kinds of beatings, as well as delivering so many wonderful lines of offbeat, funny, and satisfying dialogue. It takes a special kind of talent to put up with what is being dealt to someone in these kind of films and Lohman is great for entering that realm. The rest of the cast is effective enough as well. Everyone is essentially a caricature, but that is exactly what is"
236,XYW_Doc6_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW_Doc6_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW,Horror,Positive,Drag_me_to_hell,"The pulp-fiction title provides one clue, the quite literal visual depiction of said title one more. And sure enough, Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell is to horror films what the spring's Taken was to action movies: a satisfying, straightforward, well-made example of its genre, smart enough not to take itself too seriously, but self-possessed enough to avoid smug camp. Such films become rarer and rarer as Hollywood finds itself torn between high-profile (though not necessarily highbrow) adaptations and lowest-common denominator schlock, usually with a self-consciously ""ironic"" edge. For relief, there's the occasional clever, high-concept movie, but pure genre films - which satisfy an itch, do so with great skill and craft, and don't feel it's necessary to saturate themselves in a jokey postmodernism - have largely fallen by the wayside in the 00s. Yet one of Drag Me to Hell's virtues is that it feels so unpretentious: the concept is more or less summed up by the title (we begin with one unlucky victim literally being dragged down to hell; for the rest of the film our heroine will try to avoid the same fate), and the execution is an exercise in evoking good, solid, jumpy thrills. After the 1960s prologue in which a young Hispanic boy is sucked through the earth by demons, we settle on the initially mundane life of our protagonist, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer gunning for promotion, while trying to avoid insecurity in her relationship with hotshot academic Clay Dalton (Justin Long). Her well-ordered life spins out of control when she denies a demonic old gypsy woman an extension on her mortgage; furious that she will be losing her home, the hag attacks Christine in the office and then jumps her in the parking lot, initiating one of the scariest/funniest carjackings in recent memory. Christine quickly comes to realize that the gypsy has cursed her - in three days she will be going to hell unless she finds some way out of the curse. With the help of a psychic, her freaked-out boyfriend, and eventually a talking goat, she tries to do just that. The plot is rather ridiculous, but rather than try to complexify or satirize their storyline, the writers (Raimi and his brother Ivan) just run with it. Although she won't be pleasing any real-life gypsies with this portrayal, Lorna Raver is suitably horrific as the old hag (at one point, her dentures dispensed, she gums her victims' chin with ferocious gusto). Raver's performance, both disturbing and darkly amusing, sets the tone for the movie: acknowledging the inherent campiness of the material, but quickly moving on to more important matters, like grossing us out and occasionally giving us the creeps. (The old lady is not terrifying so much as revolting, but in a very fun way.) Raimi, who pioneered a new form of horror/comedy with his iconic Evil Dead trilogy, is certainly no genre naif. That he largely chooses to play it straight is a testament both to his faith"
237,XYW_Doc7_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW_Doc7_Drag_me_to_hell,XYW,Horror,Negative,Drag_me_to_hell,"A simple, standard set up, to be sure  nothing exceptionally clever, but all the better to be a spring board for the unhinged lunacy one expects to follow. (Much like the isolated cabin in the woods in Evil Dead, Drag Me to Hell's ""gypsy cure"" trope is meta, but never gratingly so. Raimi has always been able to balance on the homage/parody line of horror/comedy perfectly, probably because he invented a good portion of it). Too bad it never fully arrives. Things move in fits and starts, but never rev up as they should there are moments that seem to be careening along to the sort of nutso set pieces of Evil Dead, only to come to a screeching halt. The film is hesitant, unsure, never quite knowing what direction to push things, or what it wants to push  our funny bone, our guts? It tries to split the difference, and comes up short on both ends. When the invisible demon knocks out the power in Christine's house, and starts banging things around, we expect some sort of crescendo involving inanimate objects coming alive, a cyclone erupting in the living room. Instead, things just stop, dead. Blood spurts out of every orifice in Christine's face, coming out in a quick jet, when it should be huge sheets, a tidal wave  and just as suddenly the well runs dry and she's running in tears out the door of the bank. And even the climactic seance  involving the spiritualist from the opening, the big musty old house, and a demonically possessed goat  seems tentative, never quite crazy enough after its set up. Maybe I'm just expecting too much. Maybe I've seen it all before, and better. Maybe I'm missing the joke. Maybe I'm missing what Raimi is trying to do here. But I don't think so  I am generally one to cheer maximalism in every form, especially in B-movies/genre films  I celebrate their abandonment of subtly and grace, revel in their nihilistic excesses. More, always more, and more of it. And Drag Me to Hell is simply not ""more"" enough. Like I said, it does have its moments. The hollowing spirit of Mrs. Ganush puking a torrent of maggots into Christine's mouth  yes please! Or ramming her arm up to the elbow down Christine's throat? Sure! And my favorite moment of all was the very loony appearance and then deployment of a conveniently suspended anvil in a garage (because we all have occasion to have a strung up anvil in our garage, right?). But the total package is less than the sum of its parts. In the end, I wish Drag Me to Hell had focused more on the ""Hell"" part of things, and less on the actual ""dragging"", which it tended to do in between its sporadic bursts of gore and mayhem. I should never be looking at my watch, not for films like this. Even at a lean 90 minutes the film"

I just got back from the cinema after watching this crap and I expected the IMDb rating to be 5 or lower. Imagine my surprise when it has 8/10! This film is all too predictable. Think of Stephen King's Thinner meets The Haunting In Connecticut. I walk into the cinema and there is NO ONE else there. The film starts with some Mexican boy being possessed and I thought the film was going to be one of those spoof horror-comedies when I saw over-the-top creepy shadow hands crawling over the ceiling. He gets dragged off to hell because he was cursed by a gypsy whose necklace he stole. Some Mexican woman looks on and promises to get revenge on the spirit that did it. When that scene finished we're taken to the life of Christine Brown, a loan officer for Wilshire Pacific Bank. She's after a promotion to position of Assistant Manager but so is her rival - the Asian Company Agent from Prison Break season 2. She's day dreaming when some old gypsy woman starts asking her if the bank could give her more time on a mortgage repayment she missed. Christine, wanting to impress the boss, says no and so the gypsy then begs her, lunges at her and is then dragged out kicking and screaming. To be honest I thought that was simply horrible and I thought immediately that she deserved what happens but then we cut to a spooky underground car park (a setting used far too much for suspense and cheap scares) where the gypsy is waiting in Christine's car. Now here is the only time in the film where I WAS surprised. I thought the gypsy would curse her like in Thinner but instead starts attacking her with great strength and agility and it was quite funny to watch. One bit that was funny was when the gypsy's false teeth smash and she tries biting Christine with gums. Anyway, the whole fight seemed pointless as all she did was take a button from Christine's coat, curse it and give it back and THEN the predictability starts. Christine and her boyfriend drive home where she starts getting creeped out with noises and seeing scary things with sharp teeth. Before she goes home she sees an Indian fortune teller who just happens to know EVERYTHING about the curse and was luckily just next to her boyfriend's parked car. He says she's cursed and makes no attempt to help her. After a half hour of miscellaneous scares and going to see the gypsy to retract the curse again just like in Thinner (I KNEW the old bag would be dead), she sees Indian man again. He says make a sacrifice so she kills her pet cat instead of finding a stray and I KNEW it wouldn't work. Meanwhile at work, she has a nose bleed so intense that she sprays blood everywhere and"

I don't understand the positive reviews and praise? This movie was terrible disgusting schlock. Also, a complete rip-off of Stephen King's Thinner which also a shitty movie. This was supposed to be a horror comedy? First of all this movie is neither scary or funny. They might as well called this jump scare the movie. Take a drink every time there a loud jump scare scene. There's an unnecessary scene where the main character stabs and kills her cat. She got what she deserved when she was dragged to hell at the end. Good riddance! The acting is horrible and dry. Alison Lohman is an awful actress. No wonder her acting career ended after she did this movie. Her line delivery is horrid. You never believe anything coming out of her mouth especially when she tries to act angry or swears. She sounds like she's reading off cue cards. She also lacks reaction to anything crazy going on around her. She pretty much ruined this movie for me with her bland emotionless performance. She had that same stupid blank worried face the entire movie. I just wanted to punch her in the face! I was rooting for the gypsy woman to kill her! Justin Long and Alison Lohman have zero chemistry and make for boring leads. I felt like they were both miscast. Justin Long felt outta place in this movie. He looked like belonged on set of Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer. He pretty much phoned in his performance as he slept walked all his scenes. The gypsy came off more hilarious than scary. Every scene with her was a joke! This movie is way over the top and just plain old disgusting. They're replacing suspense and horror with blood, guts, and potty humor. This movie basically Alison Lohman getting attack absurdly and nastily every 5 minutes. This movie is full of gross. Burping up a fly, dentures flying out of mouths, old lady sucking on people's chins, vomiting bugs and maggots in somebody's mouth, bloody nose squirting blood everywhere, shoving arms don people's throats, possessed talking goat spouting profanities, spooky flying handkerchief's. None of this is scary or funny. Just childish, cheesy and stupid. If this wasn't made by Sam Raimi it would have gotten negative reviews and trashed by fans and critics. This movie sucked! Forgettable characters you don't care about, not scary, not funny, bad acting, dull plot, repetitive fake out scenes, gross out humor, lack of a musical score. It's is one of the most overrated horror films in the last couple of years. Sorry fans, this crap has nothing the on Evil Dead films. Those films were classics.

Is that supposed to be original in some way? Why is it that gypsies always have the power to kill people and curse people to death but can't seem to pay their bills on time or go to the dentist? This movie made me realize that Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time. He's made one half-decent movie, The Evil Dead. The other two in the Evil Dead series were totally stupid, with a couple of funny lines that caught on in the cult film world. Evil Dead 3 was total garbage. People want to make the Evil Dead series more than what it is, which is just plain bad. Spiderman sucked as well. Anyway, back to this piece of crap. So this gypsy lady with a very fake accent can't pay her bills, even though she has a clan of relatives who appear later on at her house having a party. Her false teeth fall out, but when she goes to put them back in, you can see the actress's REAL TEETH right before the cut. Then, after stealing a bowl of candy, she begs for a break on her loan even though she's already proved herself to be a deadbeat and an actress with a really terrible fake accent. So who's fault is that? The loan officer, of course. And she deserves to die for doing the right thing! And this is basically the outline for this horrible pathetic excuse for a horror movie. Then, the Mexican lady wants a shot at the demon. She's been waiting to confront it for many many years. It's been her life long goal to confront the demon that is now after the loan officer. She will risk her life to get this demon, and wants to be paid 10,000 dollars to do it! What? If she wanted the demon so bad why not do it for free? This sets up the totally stupid and done a thousand times holding hands around a table and then the floating dancing guy during comedic music (evil dead crap.) So that doesn't work and suddenly the Indian guy tells her to give the button to someone else. Why NOW? Why not when he first found out about the stupid button curse did he not reveal this tidbit of info and save a few lives in the process? And what happened during the nose bleed scene? When blood shoots 30 feet out someone's nose, coating the room and a few people in blood, do you call an ambulance or act like the person had a paper cut? Oh, let's not forget the constant shooting of various liquids into the loan officer's mouth. Constantly. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE!

When it's bad it is, indeed, painful, but even third-rate Will Ferrell + John C. Reilly is more inspired than the noisy contraptions on either side of it in the multiplex. The twist is to make Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle's pillar of 19th-century rationalism, into the latest of Ferrell's posturing child-men, another symbol of the patriarchy's dimming light. After being tricked by grade-school classmates into kissing the arse of an ass when he thought he'd be kissing a girl, Holmes purges himself of emotion and becomes a giant brain doling out punishments to those who would underestimate his powers of ratiocination. Those powers in Holmes & Watson are rather elastic. Where the trend in modern Holmesiana has been to show the great detective as a stunted giant, Ferrell stunts the stuntedness, playing Holmes as a prissy drama queen who's at least half idiot and always  even when brilliant  a fount of chaos. He and his schoolmate, Dr. John Watson (Reilly), have never really left the playground. The rub is not that Ferrell and Reilly act like overgrown 11-year-olds  that was the hook in Adam McKay's Step Brothers, a high-water mark in modern infantile comedy. It's that Ferrell's brand of low comedy is best executed with high instincts  i.e., without the nudge-nudges and wink-winks. Watch Ferrell and Reilly make the breathless case to Richard Jenkins's exasperated father/stepfather in Step Brothers that they should be allowed to create a bunk bed by setting one twin bed atop another: Their enthusiasm is contagious. Watch the pair's Funny or Die line-for-line reenactment of the unintentionally surreal duet between Bing Crosby at death's door and a joyless David Bowie: so subtle, so sublime. Holmes & Watson, on the other hand, is camp. Worse: rhythmless camp. It has been consistently misdirected by its screenwriter, Etan Coen (no ""h,"" different guy), whose idea of editing is to make throwaway jokes broad and broad jokes bludgeoning. As a director, Coen commits comedy's most cardinal sin: He gets between us and the performers. (To see how central rhythm is, watch Reilly and Steve Coogan's delicate work in Stan and Ollie: The beats  and micro-beats  are exquisite.) The first 15 minutes or so of Holmes & Watson made me doubt I'd last the next 90, an impulse to flee that I also detected, with Holmesian sensitivity, in Ralph Fiennes, who's stuck playing Dr. Moriarty and/or a look-alike. You can read his frozen face: What did I get myself into?

Admittedly, it's no Step Brothers, and I can't help wishing for a more bizarre cut of the film (there's an undercurrent of weirdness to the whole affair that feels somehow tempered), but if it feels a little elementary compared to the best of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's work (the aforementioned Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, etc.), that's not necessarily a damning distinction. That Ferrell and Reilly should take on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, feels like a logical next step for the comedy duo, as they've made something of a speciality out of two-handers featuring Ferrell as the bright star and Reilly as the yearning sidekick. Granted, their particular spin on Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creations paints his legendarily brilliant pair as emotionally stunted morons, but the point still stands: There's an archetype that the story fulfills that's a perfect match. What makes the film more than a retread, however, is also what makes it so unwieldy. As the detective and doctor work toward foiling an assassination attempt on the Queen (Pam Ferris) by none other than Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), the situations they find themselves in become increasingly bizarre. Part of it is to do with the fact that cracking the case is secondary to cracking open their hearts, and part of it is a seeming indecision as to exactly what Holmes and Watson is meant to be.It's not quite the absurdist art that Step Brothers is, nor entirely the political commentary of Talladega Nights (a sharper look at the Bush years than this year's Vice, with all due apologies to Adam McKay); instead, it falls halfway in between, failing to make a completely coherent meal out of either approach. That said, if I had to wager (with the full acknowledgment that such speculation is meaningless), I would say that director Etan Cohen was trying for something more in line with the former, as there are bizarre interludes scattered throughout that suggest a much stranger film.The best word to describe those moments is ""grotesque,"" as the film's sense of humor goes beyond the usual scatological jokes  plus the requisite period comedy jabs at modern culture and technological advancements, and some laughs at the expense of previous iterations of Holmes and Watson  and ventures into genuinely strange territory. One scene, doubling down on Watson's status as a sidekick rather than an equal, introduces something called the ""companions' room."" The roster of characters introduced there is so strange that their split-second appearance, a far cry from the triter set pieces that populate the rest of the film, is deeply jarring. Another gag spins fun out of the effects of poison, while the film's opening sequence alone involves not only turtle rehabilitation but the coining of the term ""un-crying."" It's that weirdness that makes the film's big emotional payoff  which,"

Reilly, involves a boy kissing a donkey's rear end. Believe it or not, the movie, directed by Etan Cohen, then goes even more lowbrow. Its script is replete with masturbation jokes, a lengthy vomit scene and a bizarrely sensual chess match. So the critical rejection of this film, which reimagines Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and his compadre, Dr. Watson (Reilly), from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books, as dundering fools, might have been expected. (It didn't have advance screenings for critics, which is usually Hollywood code for ""This isn't one of our finest."") The initial reviews were not kind. Neither were subsequent ones. As of Sunday, Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 9 percent fresh, up from 0 percent from the initial batch. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that ""smuggling in booze to dispel the sense of dull routine could only help."" Released on Christmas, the film took in $7.3 million over the weekend for an estimated total of $19.7 million in ticket sales. The movie's budget was $42 million.And yet, in spite of the terrible reviews, there I was on a rainy Friday in a Manhattan theater with about 20 other people waiting for the movie to start. But I went in with a different attitude from critics': What if the movie was so terrible that it's actually a great theatrical experience, a la Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room""? [Read our review of ""Holmes & Watson""] Here's the thing: I've always loved bad movies. Really, loved them. But for a bad movie to be so terrible it's redeemable, it must have certain characteristics, like unrealistic dialogue and canyon-size plot holes. The first ""Mortal Kombat"" movie? Good, even with the campy action scenes. ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation""? Even better  poor Johnny Cage! ""Star Trek Generations"" is one of my favorites of the franchise, even though it nonsensically left Kirk to die under a bridge. The telltale sign of a good bad movie: Do you find yourself laughing at all, and especially when you're not supposed to? Every gruesome scene from ""Street Fighter"" is comical to me. If you're scrolling through channels and the movie is on, would you stop and ironically watch it? If I come across 1993's ""Super Mario Bros.,"" I'm hoping to catch the scene of Goombas appearing in an elevator. (Yes, there's a trend with movies based on video games.) And a good bad movie must not take itself too seriously. On that front, ""The Godfather: Part III"" fails. The gold standard for bad movies that became good is ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" directed by Edward D. Wood Jr in 1959. Its star, Gregory Walcott, said that the script, about aliens attacking Earth by resurrecting the dead, ""made no sense."" The film was to feature Bela Lugosi, but he died before shooting began, so Wood used unrelated footage he'd shot of the horror star  and a noticeably"

Reilly doing the Conan Doyle duo, which I watched three times in as many days last week, laughing all the harder with each viewing. I peed my pants a little during one vocal eruption, but this was due in part to prostate hysteria, an engrossing topic in and of itself, but for another time. Inasmuch as Holmes & Watson is the only movie I believe I've ever watched so many times in such close proximityexcept possibly The Big LebowskiI went online to see if the critics were as enchanted as I. They were not. The professional ""experts"" were virtually unanimous in their disgust: ""So painfully unfunny we're not sure it can legally be called a comedy,"" bawled David Fear in Rolling Stone. Common Sense Media pronounced it a ""shockingly misguided assault of repetitive bad slapstick and sexual innuendo,"" while Sandy Schaefer of Screen Rant, (no doubt predictably) slammed it as ""a lazy comedy that wastes a fun premise and talented cast on tired jokes, tasteless gags, and sometimes bafflingly outdated humor."" It was after scanning these and other critics' takes on Holmes & Watson that I went to Google's audience reviews section, where I perked up a tad seeing the nachos/cheese affirmation posted by ""alexander greene."" Reading a little further, unfortunately, I soon recognized the clotted sarcasm dripping from his smartphone's miniature keyboard. I scrolled down and scanned several more of the 1,361 posted amateur reactions, none of which proffered enough insight to stem the rush of abnegation swarming my aesthetic equilibrium. I was floundering. This was the ""two"" of the ""one-two"" punch combination boxers try to deliver rather than receive. The ""one"" had come a couple of months ago as a light jab to the heart by a social media ""friend"" peremptorily advising me she wanted no ""idiot bullshit"" posted in her domain. My response was sensitive and insouciant in that I withheld defensive inquiry while assuring her all idiot bullshit I posted would be restricted to my domain. I took heart from what I deemed my gentlemanly response, yet felt the sting that any friend, even a virtual one, would regard me so suspiciously. Her admonition continued to fester, like a stubborn bruise refusing to heal, as a questioning reminder that maybe, just maybe, my notions of humor could use a little update of wokeness, or at least a brushing of mindful scrutiny. Now this. The funniest movie I've seen since Spike Jones's Fireman, Save My Child, and I'm the only one saluting it with full-throttle eruptions of howling, honest, primal appreciation.

The abomination so unholy that Netflix allegedly doused holy water on it in rejection. The massive miscalculation that, at least for a time, registered a giant goose egg on Rotten Tomatoes. Bound for box-office ignominy and an inevitable rout of its 2018 Razzie contenders, Holmes & Watson is the fourth* collaboration between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, playing the title characters in that order. And it would certainly seem to be an unmitigated disaster. If only the results were so elementary. Sure, Holmes & Watson mines familiar ground, opening on yet another purposefully misattributed quote a la Ferrell and Reilly's main works, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers. It's also a bountiful orchard of low-hanging fruit by way of anachronistic jokes that pad the movie to a commercially acceptable feature-length. Some are amusing, such as the continued presumption of cocaine, heroin and opiates as a pinnacle of medical treatment or an ""intoxigram"" as the drunk-text antecedent. Some are anemic, like the ""platypus-faced self-photograph"" preceding the duck-lips selfie. But the film is a far sight funnier than writer-director Etan Cohen's first outing with Ferrell (the witless prison comedy Get Hard). And even as Holmes & Watson never rises to Brothers' sublimely absurd skewering of male maturity, it's a brainier blunderbuss of buffoonish satire than Talladega. (Quite tough to hoist a convincingly rigid middle finger at NASCAR culture when your other hand's fist-bumping the top brass to gain organizational support.) Holmes & Watson presupposes that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's standard-bearers for seamless logic are instead both utter dimwits dining out on long-faded success. Exuding even more fey-dandy energy than he did as Mugatu, Ferrell envisions Sherlock Holmes as an impudent man-baby as reliant on drugs to keep going as he is the codependency of his relationship with Dr. John Watson. Reilly indulges in spikier slapstick than usual to make Watson a trigger-happy dunce whose mantle of authority seems honorary at best. We first meet Sherlock in his school days, bullied by his peers into kissing a donkey's ass. After learning to ""uncry"" and lock away his emotions, Sherlock gets the entirety of his school expelled (leaving the teachers to focus solely on his intellect) and takes as his only friend a young John. It's no accident that the opening credits breeze through the pair's salad days of criminal investigation. Holmes & Watson wants us to consider them as morons obsessed with public adulation and elevated perception of past glories that are, in all likelihood, more exaggerated than we've been led to believe. Sound like anyone we've heard from a lot for the last few years? Sure, Cohen goes mallet-on-the-head about it with a couple of obvious verbal / sight gags, but it's a winking dig at the continued selfish supremacy of the male ego. These are men who have utterly lost what little step they might have had in the first place and are, at least initially,"

Or any day, for that matter. If you missed the Christmas Day arrival of Holmes & Watson on the big screen, consider yourself forgiven: the film wasn't screened for critics and received scant promotion in advance of its release. Consider yourself lucky, too, because if you were planning on seeing the movie based on the kinds of Will Ferrell-John C. Reilly zingers that peppered Talladega Nights and Step Brothers, be assured that there are almost none to be had in this third pairing of the comic duo. Ferrell's Get Hard writer-director Etan Cohen does double duty again here, but fails to coax his two stars into any kind of comic rhythm. Credit the script, which is a clunky mix of ancient jokes, pratfalls and geriatric gags designed to distract us from the fact that there is no story here at all, just the lame and slightly sad sight of grown actors peeing themselves when they're worried the laughs have run dry. Sherlock Holmes has been done to death in recent years by the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Jonny Lee Miller, Ian McKellen, Benedict Cumberbatch, an animated Johnny Depp, and Canada's own Matt Frewer, to name a few. But this is not a ""new spin"" on an old character: here Holmes has been so stripped of any literary reference it's a wonder they bothered with it at all. Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and Dr. John Watson (Reilly) are pressed into service after a murder at Buckingham Palace. A calling card is left by the scheming Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes, what were you thinking?) who declares that he will kill the queen in four days' time if the first murder goes unsolved. Holmes alternates between genius and dum-dum. Watson is dissatisfied as Holmes' sidekick, though the doctor's offers of ""heroin or cocaine?"" seem to be his chief medical qualification and means of advancement. Neither actor looks like they're having any fun, regardless of the calibre of the jokes.In addition to Fiennes, given only a few lines, a standout supporting cast is criminally underused. ""Lady doctor"" Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her mute companion Millicent (Lauren Lapkus) serve as love interests for the clueless sleuths. Rob Brydon (The Trip) plays the much-maligned Scotland Yard Inspector Lestrade, and frequent collaborator Steve Coogan makes an appearance as a tattooist. Kelly McDonald plays Holmes' horny housekeeper; Hugh Laurie plays Holmes' smarter brother (and yes, we've seen that movie before, too). The jokes rely heavily on anachronism (MAGA-inspired hats... in Victorian England! Duck-faced selfies with an antique camera!) and masturbation, which, to be fair, was believed to be the cause of many a Victorian-era affliction. This may be the first Sherlock film in which our literary wunderkind pees his pants, so there's that. It's lazy, it's unfunny and it's a good thing critics didn't get"

Reilly), apparently fed up of his life, is about to launch himself from the roof of Sherlock Holmes's flat building onto his prized plant, which Holmes (Will Ferrell) doesn't want him to. ""Fall over there!"" he says, because a human life is less important than a plant's, according to the film. Cynical, because of that. Inexplicable, because the two for some reason become friends right after. HOLES AND WATSON The basic premise of the film is this: Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) has apparently fled to America to avoid arrest, and used a lookalike to take the fall. Lestrade (Rob Bydon) doesn't believe him, but Holmes runs with the theory regardless. Meanwhile, people are still being murdered, and the question that keeps being asked is, ""if the criminal who can outsmart Holmes isn't Moriarty,then who is it?"". It all culminates into some half-baked mystery about someone wanting to kill the Queen of England (Pam Ferris).Holmes & Watson's main downfall is that it doesn't make sense on any account. If Moriarty is clever enough to avoid being captured by Sherlock Holmes, why would he have fled to America to begin with? Why does he send a dead body in a cake to Buckingham Palace? To send a message? Surely, if you're going to commit such a high-profile murder you wouldn't want anyone to know you were planning it, even if you were Moriarty. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING The fallacies don't end there. Writer/director Etan Cohen couldn't have understood what film he was making, because conceptually Holmes and Watson is all over the place. At the beginning of the film, Holmes is portrayed as someone who only thinks he's hyper-intelligent, but is actually more incompetent than the people around him. But a couple of scenes later, Holmes will actually be intelligent, and then the comedy will stem from the fact that the people surrounding him are portrayed as idiots. The film is lazily written, too. It's very difficult to tell whether it was supposed to be some kind of referential humour, but there's a boxing scene which plays out almost exactly like a scene from one of the earlier Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films (of which I wasn't a fan, but compared to this one, they're like Citizen Kane). The joke is, of course, that the method of taking out his foe doesn't work, and he almost gets pummelled. But the film has no sense of comic timing, and by that point, the joke has already been used a couple of times, and just feels exhausting. The same is true of almost the entire script. There are chuckles here and there, but nowhere near enough to build a feature film on.

After a couple of cast changes, the project was shot in 2017 and delayed twice before appearing as one of the least-merry films that could possibly have opened on Christmas Day, 2018. That decade weighs heavily on it; it feels years past its freshness date, and while I think most of what's objectionable about the movie would have been objectionable regardless of the release date, it could only possibly have helped to get it crapped out when its references felt only mildly dated. The film isn't just a buddy comedy about the famous detective Sherlock Holmes (Will Ferrell) and his chronicler, friend, and assistant Dr. John Watson (John C. Reilly); it's also a direct parody of the 2009 Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law and its 2011 sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Big enough hits in their day, to be sure, but I think nobody will disagree too much if I suggest that they've left very little mark on the pop culture landscape. Even so, both are scintillating, classical works compared to Holmes & Watson, which reteams Ferrell and Reilly 12 years after Talladega Nights and ten years after Step Brothers to stiffly play at the same busy comedy of loudness. I didn't find it funny then, and I find it positively embarrassing now, particularly with Holmes & Watson handing duties from Adam McKay to Etan Cohen, whose solitary previous work in that capacity was 2015's Get Hard, one of the most broadly-hated Ferrell starring vehicles.If I were to say ""Sherlock Holmes parody made in the 2010s"", I imagine you could get most of the way through the script on your own, but for form's sake: the film opens with what will, retrospectively, turn out to be one of its best scenes, as working-class schoolboy Sherlock (Hector Bateman-Harden) arrives at boarding school, only to find that his earnestness and romanticism make him an easy target for bullies. Vowing to never feel a human emotion ever again, he turns himself into an observational genius who discovers the secret crimes of all his classmates and has, eventually, the entire student body expelled, allowing him years of honing his intellect until he becomes the genius known and beloved throughout all England. Flash-forward to 1896, and the master detective is faced with a crime so devious it taxes even his skills: someone is impersonating Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) while making threats against the life of Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) and while Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon) of Scotland Yard is insistent on finding that legendary criminal, Holmes is confident that Moriarty is being used as a ruse by someone else to distract everyone, himself included, from the truth. So he and Watson bumble their way across London, making frenemies of an American woman, Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall), whom they simply cannot believe is actually a medical professional.

Reilly. Making their previous vehicles Step Brothers and Talladega Nights seem the height of comic sophistication by comparison, Holmes & Watson features the duo parodying Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters to devastatingly unfunny effect. Numerous talented British thespians are wasted in supporting roles in this Christmas turkey that, not surprisingly, wasn't screened in advance for critics. Although making them troop out to theaters Christmas morning is something of which even Ebenezer Scrooge wouldn't have approved.Written and directed by Etan Cohen (previously responsible for the similarly witless Ferrell comedy Get Hard), the film begins with a prologue featuring a schoolboy Holmes being bullied by his boarding school classmates. The humiliation drives young Sherlock to suppress his emotions in favor of cold, calculating logic, which, as origin stories go, won't cause Spider-Man to lose any sleep.Cut to the grown Holmes and Watson attempting to thwart their nemesis Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes, mainly letting his beard do the acting) and solving crimes. When a dead body is found inside a giant birthday cake at Buckingham Palace, the duo is charged by Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) with the task of investigating the case. Assisting them in their efforts are the American Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her mute assistant Millicent (a very funny Lauren Lapkus, practically stealing the film), who was ""raised by cats."" The two women become love interests for the bachelor duo, with Watson and Grace bonding while performing an autopsy to the strains of ""Unchained Melody"" and Holmes becoming enchanted by the daffy Millicent. There's at least one scene that proves mildly amusing, when Holmes silently communicates with his brother Mycroft (Hugh Laurie, who had the good sense to go uncredited) via their shared ability to ""brainspeak."" It's a slyly witty moment that contrasts with the otherwise lame slapstick permeating the frenetic proceedings. A gag involving the eating of raw onions isn't so much running as limping. And there's a strange amount of anachronistic Donald Trump-related humor, including bits about fake news and red MAGA hats (here reading ""Make England Great Again"") that fall utterly flat in this context.But those are certainly preferable to the laborious scene in which Holmes and Watson desperately try to hide the body of the apparently dead queen, or the Disney-style musical number performed by Ferrell and Reilly that at least sounds authentic thanks to having been composed by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. A subplot involving the Titanic seems mainly designed to showcase a cameo by one of the stars of James Cameron's film about the doomed ship, which presumably played funnier in the writers' room than it does onscreen.Ferrell and Reilly flounder in their titular roles, and when Steve Coogan makes a brief appearance, it only serves to remind you of the sublime work he and Reilly do in the upcoming Stan & Ollie.

Reilly's third feature pairing, the fact that critics weren't invited, and the faint odor of horse manure emanating from the theater on Christmas morning, one doesn't need to be a master detective to deduce that ""Holmes & Watson"" is a dud  not that the packed house for a 9 a.m. opening-day show seemed to mind. As far as Ferrell and Reilly are concerned, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's unstumpable sleuth and the thankless sidekick who recorded his every exploit are not just a great crime-solving duo but one of the great bromances of English literature  and therefore a natural target for the two actors' ongoing exploration of dysfunctional friendships. The trouble is, Sherlock Holmes exists so large in audiences' minds already that the pair's uninspired take feels neither definitive nor especially fresh  just an off-brand, garden-variety parody.Is it funny, for instance, to spend an entire movie watching Ferrell's Holmes try on various hats, knowing that eventually Reilly, as Watson, is bound to steer him toward his trademark deerstalker? And what's the point in teasing the elaborate mental calculations needed to disable a boxing adversary when that particular device was treated with tongue in cheek nine short years ago, when Guy Ritchie concocted it for his own ""Sherlock Holmes"" reboot? At least in that case, the casting of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson felt risky, whereas in writer-director Etan Cohen's version, the joke begins and ends with the concept of Ferrell and Reilly as these two characters.The film's most inspired scene occurs before either actor appears, opening with an origin-story flashback to Holmes' boarding school past: It's elementary where he meets his dear Watson. This is also where Sherlock learns to suppress his emotions after being humiliated by a gang of cruel classmates, literally forcing the tears back up his cheeks.How many of the world's great minds were motivated by bullies? It would have been smart to explore what makes Holmes tick (in the books, he's so often portrayed as a one-dimensional savant), but that's as far as the movie takes the idea. Instead of further investigating Holmes' gift for logic as an especially extreme case of over-compensation, the script settles for feel-good buddy-movie treacle, suggesting that shutting down his feelings as a child later causes him to take his closest friend for granted (allowing Reilly to play a version of the same slighted-bestie dynamic in the Laurel and Hardy biopic ""Stan & Ollie"").While Ferrell and Reilly are riffing on their usual routine, alternating between slapstick (trying to kill a mosquito before unleashing a case of killer bees) and silly improv (as in a long string of faux-19th-century synonyms for ""onanism""), Cohen has assembled an impressive cast of British thespians whose only requirement appears to be keeping straight faces while the co-stars cut up.

This latest Batman tale is grounded, noir and detective based, and a highly realistic entry into the movie mythos of the caped crusader. Audiences will undoubtedly compare Nolan's trilogy and Snyder's recent iterations, both of which are worth reconsidering. And though audiences should feel a pressure to compare them, Reeve's Batman film stands on its own legs 100 % of the time. There are healthy callbacks to the comics and previous movies, but The Batman is definitive and one of the few recent movies that audiences should see as soon as possible, in Dolby Digital or IMAX at that. The premise of the film finds Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) has been Batman for around two years after losing his parents twenty years prior; he notes that crime should have quieted down, but is actually on the rise. He blames himself for the rise because of overlooked layers of mob activity, dirty police, and shady politicians. When a high-profile politician is dramatically murdered, he teams up with Lt Jim Gordon to peel back the lies that hide a crucial mystery before its too late. Famed Batman characters such as Alfred, Detective Gordon, Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Carmine Falcone, Oswald Cobblepot, and the Riddler play key roles in the aftermath of the fall of the Maroni crime syndicate. And Reeves uses them to good effect in adding texture to a gritty mystery that Batman has to tease details from to solve. Even though the detective angle is new for the genre on film, the most impressive aspects of the film are the pacing, the score, the sound design, and the cinematography. For a three hour movie, almost every scene and cut feels necessary. If the film must be compared to Nolan's trilogy, which will definitely be an argument for eons, Reeves' avoidance of grandiose spectacle makes the moments where he does use CGI a little obvious. Nolan handled practical effects better, but both films had issues with the CGI when it was necessary. We've never had this Batman on screen in live action before. The way he moves and talks, thinks and fights is completely different from anything audiences have seen before and it's done extremely well. The most notable scene for is a car chase that's the centerpiece of the trailer, but even better in the movie and five times as long. It felt like a love child of Baby Driver and Mad Max: Fury Road but even that does n't really put it into perspective. This"
252,MEM_Doc2_The_Batman,MEM_Doc2_The_Batman,MEM,Sci-Fi,Positive,The_Batman,"The Batman begins unlike most superhero films. We're thrust into the point-of-view of someone looking through binoculars to spy on a powerful political figure. No context is provided, it's plain voyeurism and foreboding all at once. What immediately comes to mind is the eerie suspense of Rear Window or Jake Gittes' own binocular surveillance in Chinatown. Shortly after, we're introduced to an unhinged and demented Riddler (played maniacally by Paul Dano, who is not a stranger to psychotic performances, i.e., Prisoners) in one of the most chilling Batman scenes to date. Later on, a narration is heard from a rugged and tempest-tossed voice that seems familiar yet nothing like we've heard before. It's the Caped Crusader we've known for many years (played with care and vindictiveness by Robert Pattinson), but there's a gruffness to his cadence and a timbre of anxiety that places him closer to a neo-noir protagonist than a crime-fighting hero. The femme fatale, Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman (played by the wonderful Zoe Kravitz), acts as both ally and foil to the bat while wrestling with her own demons. Both leads have a more than satisfying rapport together, but the film glosses over the part where their professional relationship becomes a more intimate one (Also like noir, which usually fast-tracks this part). Oswald Cobblepot (played by Colin Farrell in near-indistinguishable makeup), the gentlemanly club owner and friend of mobsters better known as Penguin, is plucked straight from the bat's colorful rogues gallery. Alongside him is Carmine Falcone (played by the raffish John Turturro), the infamous crime boss who has a stranglehold on every nook and cranny of Gotham City's political systems. These noir elements certainly belong to a Batman film, but they play out in numerous genres to create a grimy and desolate environment that inhales fear and exhales vengeance. Despite the disparity in genre interests, director Matt Reeves strikes a worthy balance. It's a part-serial killer mystery, part-superhero adventure, and part-crime drama stuffed in a 3-hour runtime that can feel loaded but never dull. Gone are the otherworldly features, intergalactic warlords, and flying mosquito aliens. The Batman harshly rips off the bandaid, and in its place are spreads of duct tape along with their uneven textures and angular divides. It's grounded in realism but leveled with sharp reds and oranges as well as harsh shadows that viciously saturate the screen. It's a beautiful-looking film and, without a doubt, the most visually arresting Batman film to date. The mystery simmering underneath the dark underbelly of Gotham centers on cryptic messages and methodical murders. James Gordon (played by Jeffrey"

In May 1939, one of the best superheroes of all time (if not ""the"" best) was created. Thanks to Bill Finger and Bob Kane: the caped crusader, Batman, was born. Ever since, there have been multiple reiterations of the classic hero, each having its own signature style and atmosphere. Like everything in life, there's the good (""Batman Begins,"" 2005) and the bad (the pantomime ""Batman and Robin,"" 1997), albeit it's always exciting to see a new movie about him. What's most interesting about the various reincarnations is how they tackle the different moralities and concepts, as well as the exploration of duality within Bruce Wayne (light and darkness) thanks to the villains attached. Each villain brings a particular conviction to the table; Scarecrow is n't going to allude (or be intrigued) by the same factors of Batman as The Penguin or Joker does. Instead, they have retained their own scrutiny and things to pick apart in wicked ways, some more than others. It has been almost ten years without a solo movie of the Dark Knight (""Dark Knight Rises""), but the time has come at last. Matt Reeves' rendition, ""The Batman,"" has arrived, and it was truly worth the wait. Reeves' picture revolves around Gotham City's underworld, where crime and drug use are at an all-time high since the death of a big crime boss, Salvatore Maroni. However, things take a turn for the worse when corrupt members of the government and the police department are killed by a sadistic killer, The Riddler (Paul Dano). He leaves a trail of cryptic clues addressed to the one called'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson). As the evidence begins to reveal that it is close to homeand the scale of the perpetrator's plans becomes ""crystal clear,"" Bruce Wayne must build new relationships, like Selina Kyle, aka. Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz), to try and unmask the culprit of these murders and injustices. In addition, he wants to take down the abuse of power and corruption that has plagued the slick and grimy streets of Gotham. This version of the caped crusader does not begin with the origin story that we have seen before multiple timesthe assassination of the Thomas and Martha Wayne, pearls from Martha's necklace falling as a young Bruce is watching, blase blase. None of that is in the"
254,MEM_Doc4_The_Batman,MEM_Doc4_The_Batman,MEM,Sci-Fi,Positive,The_Batman,"Throughout the evolution of the Batman character, we've had incarnations in comics, television, film, and various other mediums. We've watched West, Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney, Bale, Affleck, and a host of others embody the essence of the caped crusader. Each of them fighting adversaries seemingly worthy of their (and our) attention. Now, it's Robert Pattinson's turn to convince audiences that he can save the day. And it's a wild ride to hell and back. Our newest dark knight is a self-described ""nocturnal animal,"" narrating a story in'The Batman' that drips of allegory and intrigue. Presented by director Matt Reeves as a neo-noir, we are quickly introduced to old friends James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), as well as possible adversaries like Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Oswald Cobblepot (Colin Farrell), and Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). This newest film version could have fallen into tired tropes and, with a running time of nearly three hours, easily relied on fandom to carry it over the finish line. But Reeves has more up his sleeves when it comes to investing in an interesting story. This comes in the form of The Riddler, masterfully played by Paul Dano. The Riddler is a sadistic killer who targets Gotham's powerful figures using puzzles and manipulation. He does this from a distance, bringing Batman into the mix by devising clues that he must solve in order to save the day. It's this version of The Riddler that makes one's skin crawl, and leaves very little room for error. The Riddler is played not only as a supervillain, but also as a device to keep the story moving. Every clue that Batman tries to solve uncovers more truths of the past that continue to haunt the characters of the present. We are left to question who is really villainous, and who is impersonating the role of a hero all along. It is clear that Reeves was heavily influenced by detective fiction to craft a very dark and stormy plot. Reeves' version is more moody than Nolan's, more emo than Burton's, less cartoonish than Schumacher's, and possibly influenced by David Fincher. I could n't help but think about some of Fincher's films ('seven', 'Zodiac', 'Gone Girl') where a tortured main character is tasked to solve riddles, created by a worthy opponent, in a race against time. It's an incredibly effective subgenre for a Batman film, and everyone involved plays an integral role in making this film a success. With an incredible score"
255,MEM_Doc5_The_Batman,MEM_Doc5_The_Batman,MEM,Sci-Fi,Positive,The_Batman,"Matt Reeves' The Batman is a meticulously crafted film that takes the character back to his pulpier, noir-driven roots to delightful results. It's a genuine detective story that embraces the genre wholeheartedly and the nasty details inherent to it, meaning that Reeves gets to deliver not only riveting action set pieces but also truly unnerving horror set pieces along the way. One such moment is the film's opening sequence. It is a disturbing tone-setter for the film that Reeves packs to the brim with visual references and homages, not just to Batman stories, but to the classic films whose influence only grows more palpable as The Batman goes on. On paper, this is a pretty straightforward scene. The Riddler infiltrates the home of Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell Jr. and murders him before beginning to deface his body with duct tape. But the true ingenuity of the work comes in how Reeves and Academy Award-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser stage and photograph the sequence. The Batman opens on a long shot, peering through a scope into Mitchell's home. Though the audience is initially unaware of whose point of view this is, the agile movement of the camera, the visual artifice of the scope's lens and the audible deep breathing all convey that this is distinctly putting viewers in someone's shoes. Brilliantly, Reeves keeps viewers here for an extended period of time, forcing the audience to become voyeurs themselves, observing the internal lives of the Mitchell family. This sustained long-distance shot and foregrounding of voyeurism is directly reminiscent of the titular shot of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, in which a surveillance expert is hired to record a mysterious conversation happening in a public place from a great distance. With The Conversation itself, Coppola was pulling from similarly themed voyeuristic works such as Powell's Peeping Tom and Antonioni's Blowup. Years later, both Blowup and The Conversation would go on to serve as noted influences on De Palma's Blow Out. Thus, through directly visually quoting this film, The Batman is aligning itself with a long lineage of films exploring voyeurism, a theme that will go on to become integral to its story. Also, within this first shot, Mitchell and his wife are seen playing with their son, who is dressed up as a ninja for Halloween. Upon first viewing, without any narrative context yet established, this martial arts-infatuated child with wealthy parents immediately conjures thoughts of a young Bruce Wayne. But Reeves utilizes this to subvert expectations in very much the same way Burton does in his 1989 Batman. That film similarly opens with wealthy parents and a young boy (who the audience initially assume is Bruce Wayne) being the victims of a"

To the bat poles to see Matthew Reeves' The Batman! Batman. Who he is ? And how did he come to be ? Since 1986, a primary goal of DC Comics, and by extension, Warner Media, has been to create new stories of Batman's early years, and then capitalize on them. Director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig have crafted a tale that sets out to do exactly that. Effectively serving as ""Year Two,"" The Batman depicts the title character (Robert Pattinson) waging a war on crime in the bleakest of terms. Halloween approaches and foul play is afoot. Something is most definitely rotten, even per Gotham City standards. A ""truth"" seeker and self-ordained righter of wrongs calling himself The Riddler lays out his intentions to unearth the city's darkest secrets and eliminate all who are connected. His latest victim is Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. (Rupert Penry-Jones). Armed with a cipher, a sophomoric understanding of crime fighting, a bullet-proof costume and a fast car, Gotham's self-appointed right hand of vengeance, Batman, embarks on a crime odyssey the likes of which do not typically transcend the pages of detective comics annuals. It is n't long before more rogues come out of the woodwork. These nefarious characters include crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro) and his right-hand man, or rather Penguin (Colin Farrell), along with various Gotham notables. Revelations of various truths pose a threat to even the likes of Bruce Wayne. A trusted ally, Commissioner Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), and a faithful butler, Alfred (Andy Serkis), press on to keep Bruce from blinking into the abyss of self-doubt and inner turmoil. Batman's bravery, determination and prowess are matched by Selina Kyle aka Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz), whose family and friends are intertwined in the Gotham vice. Over the last two years, Reeves and WarnerMedia have been selling the world on the following elevator pitch which the filmmaker delivered during DC FanDome 2020. ""I wanted to get into the mindset of the character, and I wanted to think of the psychology. For me, I think, one of the cool deep dive (comics) was Darwyn Cooke's Ego. He's confronting the beast that is Batman, and there's a kind of duality ."" Reeves delivers upon this promise in The Batman.

Those include Kanye West saying or doing something totally outrageous, Donald Trump calling the 2020 presidential election rigged and an egotistical Bruce Wayne basking in his obscene wealth and heroism in equal measure. And now, writer-director Matt Reeves ""The Batman"" has eviscerated that third bullet point. But who is The Caped Crusader without all the flair, duality and unsettling humanity that has made him so fascinating to watch on the big screen all these years ? The short answer from the new film could also be determined after shaking a magic eight ball once: ""Reply hazy, try again ."" This irresolute reaction comes not just because ""The Batman"" is a stark departure from what we've seen before theatrically. (Honestly, it would have to be different in order to justify its existence just shy of a decade after Christopher Nolan's superb ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy). It's that ""The Batman"" reaches for an ingenious and compelling new way to tell a story about the thin lines between corruption, greed and nobility but ever so limply and always just out of its grasp. That's a bit jarring to witness after decades of watching the masked vigilante, played before by a bevy of actors like Adam West and Ben Affleck, navigate these muddy waters with sleek confidence even while making questionable choices in the most dangerous situations. With Robert Pattison in the role, ""The Batman"" character is considerably precarious and apprehensive. However, he seems to also have a big heart and wants to be part of the change for reasons not based on pride or rage but something else he ca n't quite put his finger on (and the movie, frustratingly, never tells us). Part of that pathos is due to age. We meet Bruce Wayne younger than we've seen him previously and in an earlier era of Gotham City. It's about 20 years after the brutal murder of his billionaire parents, which puts him at around 30 years old. He's alone and mopey, though evidently not without hope that he can clean up the streets simply because he feels he must. That timid faith compels him to blindly align with law enforcers, even though we know their system to be contributing to the corruption, like lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), presumably because it's the right thing an orphaned child should do to exact what he calls ""vengeance ."" But that's a word repeated often in ""The Batman"" without any real heft to it. In fact, much of how Batman operates is mechanical. Not yet inhabiting his"

There's a category of movie that used to be the Hollywood stock in trade, which a dear departed relative used to call ""brain cleansers"" one kicks back, the time passes with some rooting interest, some excitement, some curiosity about what's coming next. For its first two hours or so, ""The Batman"" largely fulfills the commitment to be engaging and clever; its deftly inventive director, Matt Reeves (who co-wrote the script with Peter Craig), conveys the impression of substance where it's hardly to be found. The movie is good with an asteriskan asterisk the size of the financial interests at stake in the franchise's intellectual property. As free as Reeves may have been to make the film according to his lights, he displays an element of custodial, even fiduciary, responsibility. It may well win him favor with the studio, with the ticket-buying public, and with critics who calibrate their enthusiasm to box-office success, but it gets in the way of the kinds of transformative interpretations of the characters that would make the difference between a baseline movie and an authentically free and original one. The Batman is a vigilante who works with the cooperation of the police, who project a bat-sign into the sky, with a bright light, as a call to him and a warning to evildoers who anticipate him swooping in. Yet, as he lands on a subway platform and lays low a gang of young miscreants, made up Joker-style, who are assaulting an Asian man, the victim is also struck with fear and pleads with the Batman not to hurt him. The Batman describes his uneasy role as an avengerindeed, he says, as vengeance itselfin a voice-over that holds out hope that the superhero will be endowed with at least an average level of subjectivity and mental activity. No such luck: that voice-over might as well be a part of the explanatory press notes for all the insight it offers into the protagonist's thoughts. Yet his haphazard thwarting of random street crime in the chaos of Gotham City gets sharply focussed on one criminal, the Riddler (Paul Dano), who, in the opening act of his crime spree, virtually summons him. The Riddler gruesomely murders the mayor of Gotham and tapes to the victim's body a greeting card for the Batman and other clues to his motives and to his next victimto the conspiracy that he has discovered and the perpetrators he's targeting.

Clocking in at three hours or so, it packs in enough plot for a trilogy, as though all concerned fretted that this might be their only shot at the rebooted DC franchise. Fear not, though. There is a teaser for a sequel, just in case this midnight black interpretation catches on with fans. This Batman, or rather, The Batman, is Robert Pattinson, an emo superhero with a pinched and pained look while out of the mask as Bruce Wayne. This scion of the uber-wealthy Wayne family is, as those familiar with story know, still haunted by the murder of his parents, who were gunned down right before his eyes. As a result, he has channeled his angst into his alter ego, The Batman, who administers his own brand of vigilante justice with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and Gordon's ability to walk the masked one into crime scenes when needed, or just y flicking on the Bat Signal to let the Dark Knight know trouble is afoot. The latest crime scene is of that of Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr (Rupert Penry-Jones), running for re-election on a family values platform that comes unraveled when his killer, The Riddler (Paul Dano), arranges for surveillance photos of Mitchell and his side-squeeze, desperate Russian emigree Annika (Hana Hrzic), to be emailed to all available media outlets there in Gotham City. The hunt for that side-squeeze, as well as The Riddler himself, leads The Batman to the sort of mob-controlled club where the elite can mix with the dregs and everyone has a good, felonious time. There he meets Selena (Zoe Kravitz), a waitress in iconic boots who is also searching for that side-squeeze because she was not only her roommate, but also her best friend. At least. In no time at all, The Batman has discovered that Selena is a fellow vigilante, unnamed but the owner of many cats and a disguise that includes a pussy hat. They seem destined for each other, and not just because they both prefer getting around the mean streets of Gotham on motorcycles. Also in play are family secrets, political corruption, the inherent violence of the class system, and a drug trade of epic proportions. Rather than neatly folding these elements into a tidy plot, we get them sequentially, but not artfully. There is also a hint about just how unlimited the Wayne family fortune is and is the one element that is dropped almost as soon as it appears that should have been explored"

Unfortunately, director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig gorged themselves on the Batman mythos and wound up creating a sluggish, over-stuffed draft of a mini-series awkwardly crammed into movie form. Falling in love with Gotham itself, they spend a lot of time presenting an interminable link-footage travelogue of characters driving to and fro, forgetting that Gotham on film has always been'70s-'80s post-bankruptcy New York City, the most over-exposed cityscape in film history. The last thing anyone needs is an extensive tour of such a standard-issue backdrop. During the film's production, its creators also appear to have lost interest in their genuinely compelling central storyline, leading them to drown it in an indigestible gooey topping of expendable sub-plots. It's as if they were thinking, ""We need to wedge in an emotional context involving a loyal family retainer here but get it over in as little time as possible! Can we unnecessarily flag biographical connections between characters, please ? Oh, do n't forget to shoehorn in the irrelevant late cameo for a popular character! We need urban blight cliches on set, please! Can someone make up a new drug for no reason ? Give Wayne a secretary but only give her 20 words. Where are the sad orphans and pitiful drug users I ordered ?"" The reasons for The Penguin to even be in this film are tenuous at best while most other side-plots never even rise to the level of red herrings. However, very early in the film's interminable running time was a scene that stunned me. Unfortunately, that scene was when Robert Pattinson's Batman (aka Bruce Wayne) spies on Zoe Kravitz's Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) as she undresses. It's a well-worn cliche that has always been tone-deaf to the fact that in real life even if it was Pattinson himself ogling a woman through binoculars it would still be creepy, disturbing, and gross. Miraculously, there are still film executives who feel that it is unrealistic, nay impossible, not to include footage dwelling on a hot female body in a way that does n't advance the plot, develop a relationship, or add any crucial subtext. Batman's presence occurs while looking for a woman, Annika Koslov (Hana Hrzic), who it turns out is hiding at Kyle's apartment. While failing the Bechdel Test by permitting only the most stunted communication between the two women, the film prioritizes cramming in an insinuation that Kyle is bisexual.
