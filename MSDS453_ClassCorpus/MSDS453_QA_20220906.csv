160,ARE_Doc1_Taxi,"Jimmy Fallon's big screen career may be over before it even gets started if his complete lack of screen presence inÊTaxiÊis any indication. The comedian, who was a hoot as Tina Fey's news co-anchor on ""Saturday Night Live"" but left the sketch show this season to pursue movie stardom, is virtually invisible next to the charismatic Queen Latifah, Ann-Margret and Jennifer Esposito in this low-watt action-comedy -- and when he's alone in the frame, you may find yourself just looking at the scenery. Fallon plays a wholly inept cop with such a bad record of wrecking cars that his frustrated lieutenant (Esposito) takes away his driver's license. Desperate to prove himself when he hears a bank heist reported over his police radio, he commandeers a taxi driven by takes-no-sass Latifah -- who, it just so happens, has customized her seemingly average cab into a presto-change-o supercharged street rod. It's the perfect car, with the perfect daredevil driver, for chasing down the crooks -- who are, purely for the sake of selling tickets to 13-year-old boys, leggy Brazilian models in a souped-up BMW. None of these asinine plot devices (which are just the tip of the iceberg) would matter if the film embraced its own absurdity, focusing on irony and over-the-top action. But the stunt-driving is almost as lackluster as the picture's star (and over-edited to hide this fact), and director Tim Story (Barbershop) stops the plot dead in its tracks for comedy set pieces, as when Fallon sings along in a falsetto to Natalie Cole's ""This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)."" Based on a French action-comedy from writer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element,ÊThe Transporter), who also produced this remake,ÊTaxiÊis so weakly scripted that it gives us no reason to invest in Fallon's redemption for his complete failure as a cop, or to care about Latifah's cursory attempts at explaining to her pouting hunk of a boyfriend why she hasn't come home for the fancy dinner he's cooked. And Story apparently cares little about suspension of disbelief because the film is plagued by distractingly obvious blue-screen effects and nearly as obvious stunt doubles. The guy (I'm reasonably sure it's a guy) who is supposed to be Latifah during the opening scene, in which she supposedly bicycles through Manhattan traffic at break-neck speeds, is at least 30 pounds lighter than the zaftig actress. Not needing a double for the humor, Latifah becomes the film's lead by default, with her spitfire sense of tough-girl comedy timing. ButÊTaxi's scene-stealer (if not its saving grace) is Ann-Margret, hilariously loopy as Fallon's sweet but permanently buzzed, margarita-mixing mother, whose apron strings he still clings to rather pathetically. As for the fledgling star, he's not a complete failure as an actor -- in fact he was terrific in his small role as a corporate-stooge band manager in Cameron Crowe'sÊAlmost Famous.ÊBut whileÊTaxiÊis certainly full of faults that would be hard for most good actors to overcome, Fallon provides the fatal blow himself by being the least interesting part of a pretty paltry movie. Then again, at least it's not the kind of over-extended sketch movie usually used to launch the failing film careers of ""SNL"" alumni.",ARE_Doc1_Taxi,ARE,Action,Negative,Taxi
161,ARE_Doc2_Taxi,"After getting nominated for ""Chicago"" and making a box-office splash with ""Bringing Down the House"" a year and a half ago, the sun was shining hot for Queen Latifah. She then turned up in a few films (Scary Movie 3, Barbershop 2, and The Cookout, which she also produced) in cameo roles. Now she's back in a star vehicle along with a comedian ready to break out on his own. Jimmy Fallon has been known to many as a member of NBC's Saturday Night Live and now he's starring with a well known actor/comedian/singer. Together, the two of them star in ""Taxi"", a film that has plenty of action, laughs, and sex appeal. While the film has the look of a clich buddy movie, Latifah and Fallon bring in their own flair of comedic skills to make a difference and take you on a New York joyride. Set in New York City, Belle (Queen Latifah) is a speed freak, in the vehicle sense. Initially a bike messenger, she takes pride in that she can run her errands in record fashion. When her time comes, she quits that job and gets her taxi driver license. On the eve of her first day of work, she fixes her yellow cab with some installments rather than spend time with her boyfriend (Simmons). Andy Washburn (Fallon) is a bumbling cop trying to make a big case stick. He's also a terrible driver. When his skills behind the wheel crashes into a food market and lets some criminals escape, his boss, Lt. Marta Robbins (Esposito) isn't pleased as she confiscates his license to drive. When some models from Brazil, led by Vanessa (Bundchen), fly into the city begin robbing banks, Andy sees this as his opportunity to redeem himself. Convincing Belle to help him out, Andy has no idea what he's in stored when he gets in her car. Belle can get anywhere in record time, but sometimes that works against her when dealing with beautiful criminals. While some of the jokes don't make everyone laugh, there are enough to keep you entertained. Queen Latifah takes the lead and flies with it. Her chemistry with Fallon isn't always on point but as the film moves on, it develops. Fallon, in his lead role, is somewhat bland as a comic. Some of his humor works and some don't. The clich scene were the two of them start talking about their lives is dull and has no pay off. What works are the action scenes involving the cars. Let's face it, when the film is called Taxi, and plot involves a heist, folks want to see more action than drama. In her first film as an Gisele Bundchen is adequate portraying a model from Brazil. Not a big stretch here, but at least she didn't foolish. If the film is a success, maybe more demanding role are forthcoming. Director Tim Story has thrown some clever stunts for all to enjoy. The scene-stealer of the film would have to be Ann-Margaret. Who knew this actress has comedic chops within her acting skills. Henry Simmons, in trying to create a name for himself since NYPD Blue will end next year, is okay as the boyfriend. It's a useless role, but a good one for him. Taxi works when the film focuses on the action and less on the drama.",ARE_Doc2_Taxi,ARE,Action,Positive,Taxi
162,ARE_Doc3_Taxi,"Queen Latifah handily walked away with the show inÊChicago. She enlivened the unevenÊBringing Down the House. Her scenes inÊBarbershop 2Êwere among the filmÕs highlights. So what is it with her and these steaming piles of donkey crap likeÊThe CookoutÊand the dreadfully unfunny, unexciting, uninspired and occasionally offensiveÊTaxi? I have to confess that I took a little nap during the middle stretch of the film, but that may be the only reason IÕm willing to give it a half-star edge over Hilary DuffÕs vehicle of destruction,ÊRaise Your Voice.ÊTaxiÊwas at least more restful, but in its own way, it may actually be a worse movie, since it wastes not only Queen Latifah, but also the rightly legendary Ann-Margret. If youÕve seen the filmÕs lackluster trailer Ñ complete with the bewhiskered tag line, ÒHeÕs armed, but sheÕs dangerousÓ Ñ youÕve seen the film. All youÕve missed is 95 minutes of padding. IÕve never seen the original French film (also produced by Luc Besson), but IÕm hard-pressed to imagine that this three-course turkey dinner isnÕt considerably worse. And if the U.S. version spawns two sequels (as its French counterpart did), itÕll be proof that Hollywood filmmaking has sunk to new levels of desperation. The story line is weak to start with. Fallon stars as the worldÕs stupidest cop, who also happens to also be the worldÕs worst driver. So when his driverÕs license is snatched (why not his badge?), he finds himself taking newbie taxi driver Queen LatifahÕs improbably souped-up cab to a robbery. We already know what a badass of the road the Queen is. SheÕs even hell on wheels with a bicycle, suggests the movie, which opens with her Ñ or, more correctly, her 30-pounds-lighter stunt double Ñ zipping through Manhattan on her last day as a bike messenger. Soon after that, we see her scaring the life out of a hapless passenger in one of her first taxi jobs. ÒBuckle up for safety, motherÉÓ she tells the client Ñ interrupted by a quick cut to squealing tires so as to keep that PG-13 rating. Not surprisingly, once she hooks up with the blander than bland Fallon, Latifa proves to be a better detective than he is. One of those improbable odd-couple buddy-bondings ensues (you wonder why I nodded off?). I suppose this kind of bubble-headed froth could have been mildly entertaining, but absolutely none of it works, thanks in no small part to Fallon and the character heÕs been given. Beyond being unfunny and unappealing, heÕs so lame and stupid that heÕs actively annoying. And I donÕt see him as much of a box-office draw. More than two or three ÒhotÓÊSaturday Night LiveÊveterans have learned the hard way that what Ñ and who Ñ people will watch for free at home doesnÕt translate into what Ñ and who Ñ they will actually pay money to see. Based on this film, IÕd say Fallon is not likely to become the next Chevy Chase or Bill Murray, and probably not even the next Dana Carvey. The next Julia Sweeney might be nearer the mark.ÊTaxiÊmight not quite be in theÊItÕs PatÊleague of awfulness, but when it calls on Fallon to do a Natalie Cole impression, itÕs not too far off. Fallon is not the only fly in the ointment, though. Latifah simply coasts on her personality, and while director Tim Story may have scored big withÊBarbershop, heÕs utterly off-key here. Even though IÕd readily concede that no one much cares about chase/crash action scenes anymore Ñ what can possibly be shown that hasnÕt been shown by now? Ñ the ones inÊTaxiÊare among the most inept IÕve ever seen. The ridiculous and badly done pileup featured in the trailer is typical of the action scenes throughout the entire movie. The blame for this could perhaps fall on the shoulders of second-unit director Brian Smrz, but considering that his credits in this capacity includeÊX 2, there must be some other hand at work, too. The real kicker is the screenplay by Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon (both of TVÕsÊReno 911!) and Jim Kouf (Snow Dogs). It is not only unfunny, itÕs generally dreadful. Guys, this is 2004, and by now we ought to be way past the idea that alcoholism is a laff riot. In addition, itÕs utterly degrading have an actress of Ann-MargretÕs caliber play a ÒfunnyÓ alcoholic. Everyone involved in this movie seems in need of a lesson in when to stop.ÊTaxiÊreaches its predictable climax a good five minutes before the movie finally takes pity on the audience and ends, thanks to an interminable scene of Latifah as a fledgling NASCAR driver (complete with a cameo by Jeff Gordon, who shows all the acting skills he brings to his Coca-Cola ads). If you absolutelyÊmustÊsee this movie, be sure you follow it up with another look atÊChicagoÊand remind yourself what Queen Latifah can do.",ARE_Doc3_Taxi,ARE,Action,Negative,Taxi
163,ARE_Doc4_Taxi,"So Jimmy Fallon leaves ÒSaturday Night LiveÓ and immediately starts making bad movies. And the circle of life continues. ÒTaxiÓ is the sort of bad movie that any hack director with a big budget, willing actors, and a shortage of good ideas can make. Like most action-comedies of recent years, it believes Òloud and fastÓ are the same thing as Òfunny,Ó and also that African-Americans being loose and sassy while their white counterparts are bumbling and squeamish is sure-fire comedy. On that skeleton of a concept the film hangs its flimsy plot. A New York City bike messenger named Belle (Queen Latifah) has just achieved her goal of becoming a cab driver, and she comes to the job prepared: She has spent the last five years pimping out her vehicle with various turbo boosters and other ÒFast and the FuriousÓ-style paraphernalia. How she obtained a New York City yellow cab to work on in her garage all that time is anybodyÕs guess, as is the question of how she convinced her new cabbie bosses to let her drive it, especially with all its illegal alterations, rather than a company-issued vehicle. At any rate, thanks to her hair-raising driving and maneuvering skills, she can now make it from midtown to JFK in less than 15 minutes. This makes her the perfect accomplice when an on-foot police officer named Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) hops into her cab one day and orders her to proceed to a nearby bank where there is a robbery in progress. Washburn is a terrible driver and previously was relieved of his license by his impossibly hot lieutenant (Jennifer Esposito). The robbers barely escape after a chase through Manhattan, but the cops figure out itÕs part of a string of robberies, which means Washburn and his new buddy Belle will get to pursue them some more. The movie, based loosely on a French film, was written by Ben Garant (of TVÕs heavily improvised ÒReno 911,Ó suggesting his skills are in improv, not writing) and directed by Tim Story (ÒBarbershopÓ). Its action sequences are competently shot and edited, but its comedy is a lame assemblage of old jokes and awkward punchlines, a typical cop comedy where the police never call for backup and are always shooting things. I give it credit for this, though: At least the Òodd coupleÓ angle between Belle and Washburn isnÕt overplayed. They work more as partners than as adversaries, which is a welcome relief. Latifah and Fallon are both funny people, and you can see them occasionally straining to break free of the mediocre scriptÕs confines. Spiced up a bit more, this would be a fine role for LatifahÕs sensibilities. I wish I could say the same for Fallon, but the baby-faced man with the dorm-slacker demeanor looks like anything BUT a police officer, and he makes no attempts to, you know, maybe ACT like one. He acts like himself, a move that might work in some circumstances but that absolutely fails when heÕs playing as specific a character as a New York City police officer. Maybe Fallon is a good actor, but weÕll have to wait for another movie to find out.",ARE_Doc4_Taxi,ARE,Action,Negative,Taxi
164,ARE_Doc5_Taxi,"TaxiÊcasts JimmyÊFallon as Officer Andy Washburn, a bumbling cop who loses his drivers license after causing thousands of dollars worth of damage while in pursuit of a suspect. En route to a bank robbery, Washburn hails a cab driven by Belle (Queen Latifah) - where the two encounter four criminals that just happen to look like supermodels. Washburn, unable to drive himself to various crime scenes, enlists Belle's help in pursuing the perps - despite the protests of Washburn's Lieutenant (played by Jennifer Esposito). It's clear thatÊTaxiÊis going for aÊStakeoutÊsort of vibe, mixing action sequences with wacky hijinks. And though it'd seem all the right ingredients are in place - aside from Fallon, Latifah can be funny when given the right material - there's virtually nothing here that works. Director Tim Story - whose most notable directorial effort thus far is the Ice Cube comedyÊBarbershopÊ- quickly proves to be the absolute wrong choice for this material, infusing the film with incredibly obvious choices and a sense of style that's beyond bland. Example: in the sequence where we first see the models, the soundtrack blares Tone Loc'sÊWild ThingÊwhile Story's camera lingers on their bodies (in slow motion, no less!) That sort of thing is indicative of Story's astounding lack of imagination, with the filmmaker, time and again, taking the safest route possible (though, to be fair, this isn't exactly cutting edge material). Unbelievably, it took three people to write this mess - Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon, and Jim Kouf - and their script is peppered with dialogue that seems to exist only to further the tired storyline. Washburn perfectly exemplifies this, as it's impossible to believe a police officer could be this inept and keep his job for more than a few days out of the academy. Rather than use any actual police work to solve the case, Washburn instead relies on tips and suggestions garnered from friends and family (Columbo this guy isn't). And let's not even get into the plausibility of Belle, with her tricked-out taxicab (how on earth could a delivery person afford such a vehicle?) and ability toÊalwaysÊbe in the exact right place at the right time. Then again, it'd be easy enough to overlook such flaws if the film contained evenÊoneÊdecent character (which it doesn't). The performances are generally of the sort of caliber one might expect from a movie of this sort, with Fallon delivering a grating, over-the-top performance that's absolutely devoid of charisma. (Latifah, on the other hand, isn't bad and deserves much, much better than this.)ÊTaxiÊis, without a doubt, one of the worst films of the year and a disastrous start to Jimmy Fallon's movie stardom. If he's hoping for a career along the lines of Bill Murray rather than Chevy Chase, he'd better be a little more choosy in the future.",ARE_Doc5_Taxi,ARE,Action,Negative,Taxi
165,ARE_Doc6_Taxi,"Jimmy Fallon needs to call Tina Fey and beg her to write a movie for him half as good as the one she wrote for Lindsay Lohan, or half as good as the stuff they used to do onÊSaturday Night Live. Then, I will laugh at his jokes, because they will be her funny, intelligent jokes instead of his moronic behavior passed off as funny. Fallon stars as Andy Washburn - the worst and dumbest detective in the history of the NYPD. He's a menace on two feet, but even worse when he gets behind the wheel of a car. After crashing his vehicle into a bodega, Washburn is busted back down to beat cop, but that doesn't stop him from commandeering Belle's (Queen Latifah) tricked out, souped up taxi to chase after some sexy, scantily clad, Brazilian models (led by Giselle ""The Body"" Bundchen) who have robbed a bank. The chase goes badly, Belle's cab is impounded, and Washburn gets fired, but the two team up in an attempt to catch the models so she can get her cab back, and he can prove he's a good cop. Can they catch the robbers before they strike again? Will we get to see the models in bikinis? Somewhere, someplace, someone is yelling at me, ""just lighten up Waffle! It's a comedy."" WRONG! It's a comedy thriller, and the comedy is so stupid, you can't believe the thriller part. Sadly, the thriller part might have worked, but someone thoughtÊTaxiÊcould be funny, and stuffed it full of idiocy instead of hilarity. Director Tim Story tries to make a decent movie, butÊTaxiÊis a flop. He is left to beat some jokes to death, like Washburn's driving difficulties. Then, he constantly gives us leering camera shots of the models every time they step out of a car. With a crummy script from Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon and Jim Kouf (based on a French movie, again proving the French haven't given us anything good since The Statue of Liberty or French Toast), Story is left to go for flashy action over plot development or establishment of a complex mystery to solve. To pad the movie when the story is overly simple, he gives us two introduction scenes for Belle, when one will do, and had to throw in some meaningless scenes and characters like Belle going to the DMV, an FBI Agent (Chistian Kane) whose whole role consists of growling about his investigation, and Washburn's Mother (Ann Margaret) who is in the movie to convince us alcoholism is funny. Story doesn't make it farcical enough to be funny, and, because it's so stupid for 90% of the movie, he can't get us to feel sympathy for characters in the right moments or take the movie seriously when it becomes about fighting crime. Additionally, Story over sanitizesÊTaxiÊto the point you never believe anyone is in danger, which takes away from the drama. Latifah does as best she can with horrible dialogue and baseless comedy, but it's Fallon who suffers the most. He is left acting dumb and outrageous as if this unto itself is funny. Some of it works, most of it made me cringe. Washburn is made to look so dumb, you can't believe he could ever be admitted to the police academy let alone solve a well-planned series of bank robberies by highly trained, amazingly skilled and deadly perpetrators, so Fallon is left to give it the old college try and hope we don't remember the early part of the movie where the audience is left to wonder if this guy is smart enough to remember how to breathe.

166,ARE_Doc7_Taxi,"How one likes ""Taxi"" has everything to do with how one responds to the hapless cop character, played by Jimmy Fallon. If this action comedy has any spark of originality, it's contained in that character, who's an idiot, but not the usual kind of idiot. He's not a lovable idiot, or a funny idiot, but an idiot as one might find in life -- struggling to assert himself and swinging wildly from diffidence to dangerous decisiveness without a moment's warning. It's a role that could make Fallon come across, in the eyes of some viewers, as a little on the irritating side, but still, the character is interesting and believable as more than a comic construction. Real laughs come in pairing this hapless but determined fellow with Queen Latifah, who brings to ""Taxi"" her usual warmth and brass and skepticism. This time, Latifah plays the comic straight man, and she's good at it. In comic terms, she's much better cast as the immovable object than as the irresistible impulse (""Bringing Down the House""). She plays Belle, the fastest taxi driver in New York City, who has equipped her cab with the kind of accessories that Vin Diesel made famous in ""The Fast and the Furious."" Washburn (Fallon) is an undercover cop whose career has been hampered by the fact that he's a terrible driver. Chasing crooks in an early scene, he leaves his car in reverse and takes out a building. The inevitable meeting comes when the cop, relieved of his driver's license, hears a police call for a bank robbery only two blocks away. He hops into Belle's cab and has her drive him to the scene. After the robbers get away, circumstances throw the cop and the cabdriver together, and they start trying to find the bank robbers, independent of a police and FBI investigation. Things go by so quickly in ""Taxi"" that it's almost possible not to notice that Belle really has no compelling reason to pursue the bank robbers or spend time with our hero. But inevitably one does notice this, and from then on one can't stop noticing. Likewise, the viewer will notice that, even though the movie is about driving, the car chases (of which there are several) are lackluster and fairly unconvincing. In a few shots, theÊcars don't even seem to be going fast, and the driving moves are prosaic. However, there may be a good side to this. Director Tim Story's heart is not in the chase scenes. He is much more interested in conversation scenes that showcase extreme personalities. In one of those, the cop takes the driver to his mother's house -- and the mother (Ann-Margret) turns out to be a cheerful, eccentric, raging drunk. The scene matches the tone of Story's film ""Barbershop,"" where the peripheral characters are parodies or distortions of recognizable archetypes. But ""Barbershop"" had a wonderful touch of madness to it. ""Taxi"" has only a sense of fun. It's a formula picture, with enough laughs to get by. I particularly liked Fallon in his first minutes onscreen, trying extravagantly to convince a Cuban gang that he is from Cuba, too.Ê",ARE_Doc7_Taxi,ARE,Action,Positive,Taxi
167,ARE_Doc8_Taxi,"ChicagoÕs Queen Latifah andÊSaturday Night LiveÕs Jimmy Fallon team up in this non-stop action-comedy. Latifah is New YorkÕs fastest cabbie whose skills behind the wheel and souped-up car help an overeager undercover cop (Fallon) pursue a gang of female bank robbers. Sometimes the collective opinions of movie critics can be overwhelming. Considering the merciless shredding that Jimmy Fallon's filmÊTaxiÊhas received, it's a wonder whyÊanyoneÊhas seen it. But, out of sheer curiousity and the desire to go to the movies for some lighthearted fare, I'm happy to say I ignored such popular opinion. TaxiÊis Saturday Night Live alumni Jimmy Fallon's theatrical debut. Now, the thing about Fallon is I've learned that his schtick is more than just the usual acquired taste. SNL fans usually can tolerate Fallon amongst the cast, but most people seem to have a low tolerance for Fallon's tendency to break character on the show and fight back laughter. Personally, I often enjoyed Fallon's contributions. And while SNL's often raunchy material is seldom funny anymore, I found Fallon at his best when surrounded by the best talent to bring out his. TaxiÊpairs Fallon up with award winning rapper-turned-actress Queen Latifah. Latifah seems to be more careful in recent years of what projects she chooses and it honestly surprises me to see her choose such a risky flick asÊTaxi. But what seems like one of the oddest possible pairups for a buddy comedy (although whoÊreallyÊknew teaming Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan would be gold?), actually works for much of the film and I found it fun to watch them play off of each other. But when I say I enjoyed much of whatÊTaxiÊhad to offer, I will admit it's not the funniest film, nor the most action-packed, nor the most creatively written film to ever grace the silver screen. While it definitely warrants bad reviews from some, I'm actually surprised, after seeing it for myself, that it got such a negative reception. The movie is a remake of a 1998 French film from Luc Besson that sparked a couple sequels. Now whether French cinema is an ideal place to pull ideas from for Hollywood remains to be seen, but I foundÊTaxiÊgood for what it was intended for -- entertainment. While a number of the jokes weren't really that funny, I didn't find anything wincingly bad (like I regretfully did inÊSurviving Christmas).ÊTaxiÊis not a film that takes itself seriously and it reminds the viewer of this throughout its duration. Fallon's comedic approach is a mixed bag of Jerry Lewis meets Mike Myers meets Adam Sandler. He's not quite as appealing as any of those celebrities but decent in his own right. What I liked about the movie is I just found it pretty fun overall. I went in expecting slop scraped from the bottom of the cinematic barrel but, instead, my wife and I left pretty satisfied. Content-wise, the film has its doses of profanity, sensuality, and violence, but is surprisingly light on all of it considering its potential. Some sexual-related dialog is present, but nothing especially graphic. And with the film's villains comprised of four gorgeous supermodels, cleavage and leg are shown aplenty. The girls wield their looks almost as dangerously as their firearms but the filmmakers do hold back from going a bit too far. Violence is surprisingly limited to mostly nongraphic encounters with just a brief glimpse at some blood on a person's shirt after being shot. Despite popular negative opinions offered onÊTaxi, I was pleasantly surprised with its outcome. Not brilliantly acted, directed, or written by any means,ÊTaxiÊis clearly not meant to be taken seriously. We're only asked that we sit back, buckle our seatbelts for safety and enjoy an hour and a half of lighthearted entertainment. But keep in mind this film -- like most PG-13 rated films -- is not squeaky clean and therefore should be carefully looked at before viewed.",ARE_Doc8_Taxi,ARE,Action,Positive,Taxi
168,ARE_Doc9_Taxi,"After five years of waiting, Belle Williams (Queen Latifah) is finally getting her hack license, and New York City had better watch out, because she makes the typical New York cabbie look like a driver's ed poster child. At the same time, Washburn (Jimmy Fallon), a bumbling New York City policeman, has just had his license taken away after totaling his third police car. When Washburn hears of a nearby bank robbery over his radio while walking a beat, he commandeers Belle's cab, and a new, extremely reckless partnership is born. Surely, something bizarre is going on with the mainstream public opinion about this film as of this writing. While I can understand someone not thinking that Taxi is the best thing since sliced bread, it's unconscionable to give this film a 1 or 2. Anyone rating this film so low can't possibly be looking at the ""whole picture"", so to speak, or they must be watching with a ridiculous set of preconceptions/expectations. When you rate a film, you have to consider the whole package, as an artwork. There's a lot more to it than whether you like the story or not, whether you thought it was funny or not, or whether you think it's realistic or not. For example, the cinematography in Taxi is incredible. Just the opening sequence alone, featuring ""Belle"" on a high speed, stunt-filled messenger bike ride through New York City makes the film worth a few points. The camera work and staging are stunning. There are all kinds of unique, subtle touches in the scene, like the shot of traffic where only the cabs are in color at first. It seems that a lot of people don't like the film just because it's a remake of Gerard Pires' 1998 French film of the same name, or just because it's a Hollywood film, or just because they've changed the gender or dispositions of the characters, or because they're misunderstanding the idea of comedy and expecting realism. None of those facts make this an inherently bad film. The idea is that you're rating/reviewing a film, as an artwork, not making a political statement or rating cultural facts that have nothing to do with what's on the screen. I disagree that fiction is necessarily making claims about how the actual world happens to be. Especially comedy cannot be just realistic and still be funny. To be comedy, something has to be absurd, exaggerated, made ironic, and so on. In general, I'm not looking for realism in films, even though Taxi has some very interesting and funny jabs at the real New York City. There are people like Belle and Washburn here, even if less comically exaggerated. There are cabbies who drive like Belle--I had the misfortune of riding home from the Newark airport with one who was going 100 mph (160 kph) while weaving in and out of traffic, often straddling two lanes. I've seen a number of people use Washburn's method of parallel parking (that's one of the reasons I pay for a garage instead). A lot of people here live in converted warehouses, industrial spaces, and so on, often ""illegally"". Apartments are so expensive that this is often the only alternative. So it's not only funny and in character that Belle sleeps right next to her car, which she would rather work on in the middle of the night before she attends to her boyfriend, it's not that far removed from reality. If you did happen to be looking for realism, the film has plenty. But Taxi is fiction, after all, and often cartoonish fiction at that. That's to be expected in much comedy. The opening bicycle ride isn't only amazing technically, it's funny _because_ it's supposed to be Queen Latifah on that bike! Jimmy Fallon's character was hilarious to me. He's a Clouseau-like bumbling nincompoop, but with a different kind of self-awareness that he's trying to veil with that special New York City ""street tough"" veneer. It perfectly skewers the public face that most people put on in the city. Latifah and Fallon complement each other in many ways. It was a pairing that I would have never thought of, but it is brilliant. There are a large number of scenes that will stand out in my mind for a long time. And as good as Fallon and Latifah are, Ann Margaret, as Washburn's mother, nearly steals the scene every time she appears. She's a lovable drunk with an amicable, libertine outlook. Her apartment is a delight of tacky 1970s fashion, which brings up another exemplary technical aspect of the film--the production design. But Taxi is also an exciting action/crime/thriller. The car chases often come close to those of another fantastic, unjustly underrated film--The Fast and The Furious (2001). The stunt driving is amazing. While the crime plot certainly isn't the focus of Taxi, it's more than just a throwaway device to propel our protagonists through their character development. I'm not arguing that everyone should come away from Taxi believing that it's a 10 as I do. Tastes differ, and these characters, or these actors, in these kinds of situations with these personalities, as well as this kind of pacing, fancy camera work, etc., could be not quite to your taste. But the extremely low scores from some only show that those reviewers aren't taking their assumed role as film critics seriously (this is even true of some professionals--just read Roger Ebert's review of this film), and if they're not giving that much respect to the artform they're engaging with, it's difficult to see why anyone should give much respect or consideration to their views. To say that a film like Taxi is anywhere near the technical incompetence of a film like Back Woods (2001) or The Black (not Blair) Witch Project (2001), which is implied when you rate the film a 1 or 2, is beyond reproach.",ARE_Doc9_Taxi,ARE,Action,Positive,Taxi

180,HLU_Doc1_US,"For those of you uninterested in a deep dive into the sophomore film by burgeoning auteur Jordan Peele, I’ll say this: “Us” hits all the horror buttons for fair-weather viewers looking for a spook or a creep, a twist, and a gasp. The wild-eyed visages of people matching in ruby jumpsuits gripping shimmering gold scissors are enough to scratch the itch for two hours of goosebumps running up you are stiffened back. Like “Get Out”, Peele’s 2017 directorial debut, ""Us"" has all the elements we expect from a modern horror film. Seemingly supernatural characters in ominous garb and freaky masks. A mysterious wall of bunnies trapped in wire cages. A chase. Kill or be killed. If you want to get your kicks, “Us” delivers. It’ll kick the crap out of you. Deeper than that, it is a multi-layered web, a deep-dive look at and social commentary on the current state of America – or perhaps where it’s always been. Like his first, this film, beneath its metaphors and allegories, has something to say. The Wilsons are your all-American family. Comprised of mom Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), dad Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex), the Wilsons are heading out to their vacation home near Santa Cruz, a sleepy beach town up the California coast known for its laid-back surfer attitude and eccentric boardwalk filled with games and rides. Like “The Lost Boys”, Santa Cruz is the perfect setting for Peele to unleash his monsters. The Tethers live underground, exact replicas of their human counterparts above and forced to mirror their movements through life. As a child, Adelaide has a close run-in with her Tether, Red, in a Funhouse on the boardwalk, which also serves as a gateway to their lair. It haunts her into adulthood, and when weird coincidences begin to happen, she feels the onset of a bloody uprising, a revolution 30 years in the making. I won’t expand on the plot beyond that because the surprise is in the details, but suffice it to say Peele has a way with images. He isn’t afraid to linger for a minute – or more, in the case of the opening sequence – to build the mood. His leisure is our pleasure, in this case, and much of the runtime is spent analyzing what he chooses to show us. The cast has their work cut out for them. The dual-task of embodying both their human and Tether characters is physically and emotionally rigorous, but everyone shines, particularly our heroine/villain, played emphatically by Nyong’o. Her talent is profound in these roles, and, just like in the film, she is the heartbeat of the story. But what sets “Us” apart from others in the genre, and likewise Peele apart from his contemporaries is the voice that whispers a warning in every scene, a foreboding that follows you out of the theater and into your sleeping subconscious. The film makes a stark statement on the way we view what it means to be American. There is the commercial, sterilized misconception that Americans come together, and stand hand in hand (literally) in solidarity when the going gets tough. But underneath every American is a Tether, a soulless creature fighting to rip and claw to the top. If that doesn’t pique your interest, I’m not sure what will.",HLU_Doc1_US,HLU,Horror,Positive,US
181,HLU_Doc2_US,"Lupita Nyong’o stars in Jordan Peele’s newest horror-thriller depicting a family’s chaos when a group of doppelgängers begins to terrorize them. Pam says:   “Us” starts off strong, but becomes a typical slasher film with gruesome brutality.  Thankfully, Peele’s sense of humor is a constant throughout the movie lightening these gory scenes.  Strong performances elevate the film, but Peele seems to focus too much on outdoing the last feature that he forgets to focus on the story at hand.  The plot twists don’t always add up and there are too many red herrings that create a sense of disappointment as Peele doesn’t follow through.  It’s a strong second feature, but doesn’t live up to the creativity and storytelling of “Get Out.” Chuck says:  Combining horror with humor is no easy feat and Peele does this with aplomb here as he did in “Get Out.”  It’s this film’s strongest suit as he expertly manipulates us to drop our guard only to have us lurching back in our seats throughout. The movie’s first two acts are very strong, setting up a sense of dread that promises a big payoff.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t come as the third act is overlong and the explanation for all that we’ve seen just doesn’t add up.  Without question, Peele has a great deal to say about the world we live in and gets some of his points across but in the end, “Us” ends up being a film that aspires to greatness but ultimately falls short. When Get Out was released in 2017, it became a phenomenon due, in large part, to writer and director Jordan Peele’s clever take on both horror movie tropes and racial issues. The success of that film put huge expectations on whatever he decided to do next, which just so happens to be another whirl in the horror-Esque zone with Us. The film centers on Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong’o), who experienced trauma as a young girl that has haunted her into adulthood. She and her family – husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex) – have returned to her childhood home in California for vacation, an ill-fated trip if ever there was one. That’s because, on their first night there, they’re confronted with a group of doppelgängers, four people who look exactly like them but whose mannerisms are completely different. The violent threat they demonstrate is just the tip of the iceberg in this perplexing film that offers both surface-level thrills and an obvious attempt at deeper-level thinking. Just like Get Out, Us is not a straightforward horror film. There are sections containing some intense and bloody scenes, but Peele is not interested in just making a slasher movie. He uses the character of Gabe to bring in a lot more humor this time around, and he also plays with the emotions of the four main characters, subverting expectations of “natural” reactions to traumatic situations. Peele’s vision is aided in a big way by cinematographer Mike Giolaukis and composer Michael Abels. The imagery of the film is stunning, with Peele and Giolaukis working together to produce some instantly iconic scenes. And the foreboding and highly memorable score by Abel enhances the film at every turn, especially when he uses a certain four-note sequence. The subliminal messaging that Peele employs will likely require two or more viewings to fully understand. He trots out a multitude of references and imagery that can be both easy and difficult to unpack. An allusion to a Bible verse about God bringing a disaster to Earth is simple enough, but the central idea of doppelgängers, along with imagery of rabbits and talk of consumerism, among other things, provides no easy answers. Thankfully, the confounding nature of the film’s symbolism does nothing to detract from the performances. Front and center are Nyong’o, who makes the most of her first starring role. She is heroic and ferocious as Adelaide, and creepy as hell as her double, Red. Duke is a lot of fun, giving a completely different look than his turn in Black Panther. And Joseph, ahead of her role as Young Nala in The Lion King, steals a lot of scenes with her dual parts. While imperfect, Peele and his team get enough right with Us to make it a worthy follow-up to Get Out. Combining popcorn thrills with thoughtful commentary is Peele’s calling card, something that should make him a director to watch for years to come.",HLU_Doc2_US,HLU,Horror,Positive,US
182,HLU_Doc3_US,"An idyllic vacation turns into a living nightmare when a family comes face to face with murderous versions of themselves. The highly anticipated follow-up from getting Out mastermind Jordan Peele delivers more of his now signature style but also flips a switch on something you’d never expect. His ability to create another flawless and compelling story truly cements him as a true Master of Horror. Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong’o) and her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) travel to their family beach home with their two children, hoping for a relaxing time together. Adelaide isn’t too keen on the idea of the trip, especially spending the day at the beach with their insufferable friends (played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss). Their trip will soon take a frightening turn as a creepy family stalks them from outside their home. However, it’s not just any family, but an exact copy of each of them. Adelaide will do whatever she can to save her loved ones from the demented doppelgänger hellbent on killing them off. While Get Out was boasted as a social thriller due to its apparent racial tones and overall theme, Us removes itself from that. Director and writer Jordan Peele stated that he wanted to make a film about a black family, simply just existing, without their race being the focus. The film does however have a subtle dissection of our county as a whole, but it’s much more subconscious – you’ll have to get a little philosophical with it. Peele also steps a bit outside of the psychological aspects of his previous film, and into a more gruesome concept. It’s a twisted story with a lot more chaos… and blood. But Peele wouldn’t be great at what he does if it weren’t for his ability to balance humor in there as well, timing things for levity that is just too perfect. Some of the most fun moments coming out of the impeccable musical cues (there’s an N.W.A “Fuck Tha Police” drop that is pure brilliance). What I appreciated most about this story, was the focus on the lead female character – a mother who can handle her own in a badass fashion. It was refreshing to see a family dynamic where the husband didn’t try to be the savior and instead trusted in her instincts. Nyong’o excelled in the role in every aspect, she was a force to watch. US brought to the screen a completely unique story that was constant fun, thrills, and beauty. Peele’s work is inspiring as he creates a perfect film with fantastic collaborators, like Michael Abels who creates a stellar score for our ears. It’s truly one of those films that is a must-see. With 2017’s breakout horror hit Get Out, Jordan Peele cemented himself as the writer/director to watch, his acerbic wit and mind for brilliant visual metaphors combining to make the world love smart, social horror once more—even while it’s telling us to look in the mirror. With his sophomore film Us, Peele once more raises the looking glass to our eyes, this time inviting us to pass through it and discover a netherworld we’ve long tried to ignore. Part home-invasion horror, part Twilight Zone mystery-thriller, Us follows Adelaide Wilson (a remarkable Lupita Nyong’o) as she returns to the seaside town where she suffered a traumatic event as a child. Soon after she and her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) arrive with their children Jason (Evan Alex) and Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), their summer home is besieged by vengeful, jumpsuit-wearing doppelgangers. Unfortunately, the film that follows is not as clear or incisive as Get Out—it introduces so many ideas that it can be difficult to focus. But it’s fascinating to watch those ideas emerge, contort and dance around on screen, even if they don’t always come together to form a cohesive story. Like its predecessor, Us makes you laugh and ruminate more than scream, but that’s certainly Peele’s point. When you’re not marveling at the acting abilities of Nyong’o, you’ll be spinning your wheels trying to put together a puzzle that can’t be solved. Watch it at Assembly Row, Boston Common, Coolidge Corner, Fenway, Seaport, Somerville, South Bay and in the suburbs.",HLU_Doc3_US,HLU,Horror,Positive,US
183,HLU_Doc4_US,"We can probably all agree that looking at your phone or talking during a movie is rude. But something we don’t really think about and ought to recognize is that these are anxiety-reducing activities. That’s not an excuse, you still shouldn’t do it, but knowing this kept me from being surprised to see so many little screens lighting up and a group of people talking throughout a recent showing of Jordan Peele’s horror-thriller Us. I do NOT blame these people for needing to reduce their anxiety. In Us, Lupita Nyong’o plays the mother in a family of four on vacation at a beach house. One night, the family wakes up to find four shadowy figures standing in their driveway, and, not long after, this becomes a terrifying home invasion. Far more disturbing than even that is the fact that the mysterious invaders look essentially exactly like Nyong’o and her family, except that there is something very, drastically wrong with them. Beyond that, it’s best I don’t say, because you should know as little as possible going in. But I can say that between this and 2017’s Oscar-winning Get Out, Peele has shown himself to be an expert director of horror and suspense. He plays within the genre while avoiding clichés, his shot compositions are both beautiful and designed to make us uneasy, and he knows where to place a few well timed jokes so the extreme tension of the movie is maintained without making the whole thing feel oppressively punishing. Peele understands what scares us on a visceral level, and he knows it’s not just gore or silly surprises—often, what really scares us already lies within us. If Us contains a subtext of social commentary, it’s far less overt than it was in Get Out. In fact, I’ve read at least half a dozen reasonably compelling theories of what Peele is saying with this movie, including relating it to Jungian psychology, our current political climate, and seeing it as an indictment of Reagan-era social policies. I won’t tell you what I think, because part of the importance here is thinking through it yourself, but the movie is wide open to interpretation, and any one of the many theories could be true. Or, none of them could be true. Us works incredibly well just as a horror movie: it’s genuinely frightening and has images that will burn themselves into your brain. The movie’s not without its flaws—it’s not particularly internally consistent, and one twist was a bridge too far for me, but none of this detracts from the full experience, and besides, the best advice I got before heading to the theater was just not to think too hard about it. And though horror, as a genre, is shamefully overlooked when it comes to awards season, one exception for this movie may be Lupita Nyong’o, who has every chance at an Oscar nomination for Us. She’s extraordinary in her dual role as both the mother and her terrifying doppelganger, expressing resolve and vulnerability alongside searing homicidal anger and traumatic distress. Us is an intense, powerful, and unsettling ordeal that will not lead you by the hand to any conclusions, but will force you to take a very hard look at who we really are.",HLU_Doc4_US,HLU,Horror,Positive,US
184,HLU_Doc5_US,"Jordan Peele’s 2017 thriller Get Out turned one half of sketch comedy duo Key & Peele into one of Hollywood’s hottest filmmakers, earning the first-time director an Academy Award and prompting the inevitable question of how anyone could follow up on success on that level. So it’s with no small amount of anticipation — and high expectations — that Peele’s latest film, simply titled Us, arrives in theaters. Although it doesn’t pack the psychological punch that Get Out did, Us confirms that Peele’s phenomenally successful debut was no fluke — and that the praise he’s been given is indeed well deserved. Written, produced, and directed by Peele, Us follows a family whose beach vacation is interrupted one night by a vicious group of home invaders. The terror of the encounter is amplified by the discovery that the assailants are twisted versions of each member of the family — and they’re forced to fend off their murderous counterparts if they have any hope of surviving the night. Get Out initially showed Peele’s talent at not only casting the right actors, but drawing performances out of them that are full of surprises. His skill at assembling and utilizing a talented cast shines again in Us, which reunites Black Panther actors Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke as Adelaide and Gabe Wilson, a married couple on vacation with their son Jason and daughter Zora, played by Evan Alex and Shahadi Wright Joseph, respectively. All four of the primary cast members bring an impressive level of depth to characters that could have easily slipped into typically forgettable victim roles, pausing when they should be running, or screaming when they should be hiding. They’re a smart bunch, even when they make head-shakingly bad decisions that put them in peril, and their chemistry as a family unit goes a long way toward creating an emotional investment in their fates. Portraying both the victim and the villain in a story is a tall order for any actor, but the cast of Us makes it look effortless. The performances of the four leads as the Winston family members are impressive on their own, but Us reaches even higher by having the four actors also play their psychopathic duplicates. Portraying both the victim and the villain in a story is a tall order for any actor, but the cast of Us makes it look effortless, adding depth to both roles where appropriate and selling the audience on both the terrorized family’s strength of will and their mirror images’ remorseless, unpredictable deadly intent. Nyong’o in particular is fascinating to watch, and she goes above and beyond simple good and evil representation by giving each character their own, unique way of walking, talking, and carrying themselves. The extra effort that Nyong’o and her castmates put into their two-part performances pays off with some genuinely disturbing juxtapositions of the characters and their twins, who are eerily similar on the surface despite being completely different in every other way. Not everything about Us is a paired set, though — particularly when it comes to the film’s similarities (or lack thereof) with Get Out. Although Us confirms that Peele’s knack for horror wasn’t a one-trick act, those expecting a film that mines the same fright material as Get Out won’t find much in common with that film. Where Get Out relied heavily on psychological terrors and a creeping sense of dread in a relatively bloodless — right up until its third act, at least — mind-bending scary story, Us is a more straightforward horror film. The eerie mystery of the doppelgangers’ existence is secondary to the blunt terror of their home invasion and pursuit of the Wilson family, and there’s little question about exactly what kind of film Us really is. To Peele’s credit as a writer, he does an admirable job of streamlining the narrative to move past the story’s big questions in relatively quick, semi-satisfying ways, but his focus on making the film a more straightforward experience than Get Out could still leave some audiences wanting more answers when it comes to the more complicated plot points he introduces. Us is a slasher movie first and foremost, after all, even if it does have some narrative (and socially relevant) layers to unpack for audiences interested in going down that road. It’s not likely to receive the level of critical acclaim as its predecessor, but Us still manages to carve out an impressive niche for itself in the horror genre. Subversive, scary, and fantastically well acted, Us is the sort of film that can be enjoyed on one level as an entertaining, satisfying slasher film, while also offering something for audiences who want more than just a family being terrorized by a group of psychotic killers. What it occasionally lacks in satisfying answers, it more than makes up for in ambition and cinematic execution, thanks to the film’s talented cast and filmmaker. Us probably won’t bring Peele another Academy Award, but if the film’s intent is to be the sort of movie that sticks with you long after the credits roll, and that fuels a nightmare or two, it’s already a winner.",HLU_Doc5_US,HLU,Horror,Positive,US
185,HLU_Doc6_US,"They say lightning doesn’t strike twice, but sometimes it does with hit movies. Ridley Scott followed up his superb The Duellists – which won best first feature at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival – with seminal sci-fi hit Alien two years later, scoring a special effects Oscar for its chest-bursting menace. Quentin Tarantino topped Reservoir Dogs with Pulp Fiction. So I was pumped for Jordan Peele’s much-hyped sophomore feature Us about a family menaced by stab-happy doppelgangers, after his exhilarating, Oscar-winning debut Get Out smartly rewired the horror genre, lancing rampant racism and creeping white privilege. Sadly his flash of brilliance totally fizzles this time. A genuinely unnerving set up in a 1986 fairground totally gets the creak of terror lurking in these places, with a wide-eyed Madison Curry as a young girl attacked by her evil double after being lost in a funhouse mirror hall. Positing another clever metaphor, with Americans as their own worst enemy, Peele soon loses focus. Jumping to the present, a goofy but overlong section sets up Black Panther duo Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke as a married couple taking a break in their wood-surrounded holiday cabin (never a good idea in horror films) with their kids, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex. Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the family’s maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but there’s no real terror. We do get a much more brutal attack on the neighbours, including The Handmaid’s Tale’s Elisabeth Moss, but a re-run is a re-run. The film’s laborious pace is further hampered by Nyong’o’s bad reflection setting out their terms in the worst asthmatic wheezing committed to film since Tom Hardy’s much-memed Bane. Peele manages to bury the film in a turgid cement of tedious exposition while still leaving the basic world-building foundations decidedly wobbly. Get Out already joked about villains monologuing their dastardly plan. Pushing the same punchline here is just lazy. The patchy humour fares a bit better as the ‘good’ family gets increasingly violent in their fight back, but it’s so on the nose it literally references Home Alone. Yeah, we got it. Pop culture call-outs galore, including an iconic line ripped from the Star Wars saga, only serve to highlight the dearth of new ideas here. With Peele borrowing liberally from better films like The Shining, it ends up feeling like a tired rehash. Speaking of which, I’m not going to die and be resurrected on a hill claiming the probably unnecessary Pet Sematary reboot is a masterpiece, but it at least has more fun re-animating Stephen King’s zombie cat story with a zippier pace. Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, the movie doesn’t give Jason Clarke quite enough space to really work the crazed grief of a father tortured by a devastating accident, but there’s just enough here to hurt. Tinkering with the tragic 1983 novel and the 1989 movie adaptation, it delivers a couple of surprises more welcome than un-dead family members at the door. Pet Sematary is out now, and Us is in cinemas from April 4.",HLU_Doc6_US,HLU,Horror,Negative,US
186,HLU_Doc7_US,"Is my own doppelgänger going to kill me if I don’t shower Jordan Peele’s latest with praise? Am I going to rack my brain with guilt for not loving a movie I’m straining to applaud? Or is something deep inside me going to make me, against my better judgment, evade the fact that Us (2019) is not a particularly good movie? It pains me to write this. The writer/director struck gold with Get Out two years ago and deservedly so, tinging each scene with social and emotional discomfort that passed for both abject horror and pitch-black comedy. It was a sterling effort that overflowed with ideas but never tried too hard and, in a choice more admirable in theory than actuality, Peele has decided not to replicate his previous success. His latest film makes it clear off the bat that this is not a satire or a bonafide social comment. Us is psychological horror in the vein of The Twilight Zone, something that Peele has aped in the past (and is even rebooting). And this works very well at first in how he, both as a writer and a director, approaches his craft with patience—no cheap scares, no silly gimmicks. With Mike Gioulakis (Under the Silver Lake) as cinematographer and a sleeker approach to both light and dark, it’s clear this movie is going to be something nicer to behold. But then it becomes just as clear that there’s far less beneath the surface. Like when most talented filmmakers stretch themselves in too many directions, Us is full of things that just don’t cohere. We start off in 1986 Santa Cruz where young Adelaide (Madison Curry) is on a birthday trip to an oceanside amusement park with her parents (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Anna Diop). It goes well enough for a while, but something takes over her. She wanders into a hall of mirrors where she sees her doppelgänger and, upon reemerging to Mom and Dad, seems to be suffering PTSD. Fast-forward to current day and Adelaide (now played by Lupita N’yongo) is headed on a vacation with her dorky husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex). The lakeside house is nice and all, but Gabe wants to take the family to the ocean. Adelaide resists but gives in for the sake of the family and that night after returning home, they spot a family in the driveway. It’s all of their doppelgängers—seething, primal mirror versions of themselves who only seem to act on their ids. Unlike Get Out, though, Peele keeps this central conceit pretty close to the vest for a while. Us works best when it’s stylish, placing its characters on a literal coast against the unknown and capturing them with a visual style that feels on the verge of wrapping around itself. Inspirations are proud but never obvious ranging from The Shining to Night of the Living Dead to more comical revisionism like Shaun of the Dead. The film is never particularly scary past the first half or so, but it has the suspense needed to be fun. And then it decides to stretch its premise into full-on comedy. This isn’t inherently a bad thing, but Us plays both its psychological horror and slapstick comedy on full tilt to the point that respective sequences never mesh together. Some are admittedly funny, but Peele rarely finds the balance between this broad humor and the human core he sets up earlier. Scenes and set pieces begin to drag on for too long and, although they never become boring, they certainly wear thin, especially once you realize that they’re simple diversions from the themes Peele is trying to address. It’s an almost-two-hour movie that’s so frustratingly detached from itself that it falls short of coasting on its entertainment value. Peele’s script reverts to hodgepodge social commentary towards the end that, although alluded to at the beginning of the film, is neglected for long enough to deflate any true sense of tension. This is especially evident through family friends Kitty and Josh (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), a boho-chic married couple whose own scenes never amount to anything beyond a few amusing gags. Once Us unveils its deeper intentions, it doesn’t enough prove to be that deep at all. Does it stay true to its genre-based promises? Sure, but it doesn’t bend them. It pigeonholes them into a mythology too half-baked to work and the twists, while decently executed, prove to miss as often as they hit. And yet I still couldn’t bring myself to entirely discredit Peele’s attempts here. I just wish they added up to something. Even if Us has deeper meanings—and it’s clear that it does, especially given how much it telegraphs them all—I wonder if I’d be paying as much attention to them if Jordan Peele wasn’t behind them. Us is currently available on Digital and arrives on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, DVD and On Demand on June 18, 2019 from Universa Picture Home Entertainment. Special features on the releases include scene explorations [not available on the DVD], five featurettes exploring the films themes and providing behind-the-scenes looks at the production, deleted scenes, outtakes, and an extended version of the dance sequence.",HLU_Doc7_US,HLU,Horror,Negative,US
187,HLU_Doc8_US,"Few directorial debuts were as shattering as Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winning horror flick “Get Out” (2017), which not only won Best Original Screenplay, but should have won Best Picture (Rewriting Oscar History). It stands as a masterpiece of cultural significance and cinematic artistry, repaying on repeat viewings with enough double meanings to fill a film theory class. Thus, we get the eager anticipation and unrealistic expectations of “Us,” which again boasts powerful performances of tear-stained cheeks, stunning technical prowess with symbolic imagery and “sunken place” social satire. This time, however, its surface-level plot piles the “gory” on the allegory, straining its metaphors with logical inconsistencies beneath the twists. The story opens with Young Adelaide Wilson (Madison Curry) wandering off from her parents and suffering childhood trauma at a boardwalk fun house in Santa Cruz, California. Decades later, grown-up Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o) and her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), take their kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), on a return trip to Santa Cruz, but their family vacation turns chaotic when dangerous doppelgängers appear in their driveway. The dual personas provide a powerful stage for Nyong’o, who deserves Oscar consideration for Lead Actress six years after her Supporting Actress win for “12 Years a Slave” (2013). She essentially has to play two roles: one as a traumatized middle-class mother, one as a hoarse-throated shadow figure, but both with protective maternal instincts. You’ll instantly recall Daniel Kaluuya’s teacup hypnosis as Nyong’o keeps her eyes “Peeled” in bulging, teary terror. The same goes for Duke (“Black Panther”), who dons a Howard University sweatshirt and glasses to crack goofy dad jokes, then shifts to farsighted squints and primal moans as his shadow double. Most impressive are the child actors, as Joseph plays teenage innocence before shifting to a freaky frozen grin, and Alex playfully wears a plastic Halloween mask before shifting to his pyromaniac duplicate to wear a much creepier, canvas-style mask. Peele was inspired by the “Mirror Image” episode of “The Twilight Zone” (1960), which he is rebooting this spring. Cinephiles will also notice shades of Don Siegel’s “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1956), Michael Bay’s “The Island” (2005) and Charlie McDowell’s “The One I Love” (2014), which fittingly starred Elisabeth Moss (“Mad Men”) in a double role. She returns in “Us” with Tim Heidecker (“Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!”) as the wealthy parents of twins. Directing duplicates requires a carefully constructed dance of body doubles and over-the-shoulder trick shots — just ask Tatiana Maslany in BBC’s “Orphan Black” (2013) and J.K. Simmons in Starz’s “Counterpart” (2017). But it’s worth the challenge, as it provides endless possibilities for dynamic direction. In “Us,” Peele presents Nyong’o’s face pressed against her reflection in the cracking glass of a coffee table, a high-angle shot of the family on the beach with long shadows stretching across the sand, and the distorted images of funhouse mirrors. The latter-most is the most disturbing in a masterful opening boardwalk sequence, where Peele blends the whistling child danger of Fritz Lang’s “M” (1931) with the beach terror of “Jaws” (1975), right down to Jason wearing a “Jaws” T-shirt (Peele reportedly asked Spielberg for permission). The fact that Young Adelaide wears a Michael Jackson “Thriller” T-shirt is even creepier after the King of Pop’s pedophilia allegations in HBO’s “Leaving Neverland” (2019). Note the way that Peele constructs this sequence: (A) Young Adelaide’s face moves from light to dark (i.e. film noir), as she descends the stairs to the beach; (B) Lightning eerily flashes in the night sky in the distance; (C) An insert shot shows a candy apple abandoned in the sand as a few rain drops start to fall; (D) The rain lets loose in a downpour as Young Adelaide stands alone in the chiaroscuro-lit doorway of the fun house before plunging into a dark hellscape. The film’s next big set piece, the home invasion by the doppelgängers, is equally masterful, playing on the same fears of intrusion as “Night of the Living Dead” (1968), “The Evil Dead” (1981), “Scream” (1996), “Funny Games” (1997), “The Others” (2001), “The Strangers” (2008) and “The Purge” (2013). This is where you’ll clutch your date on the edge of your seat. And then, the film’s tone frustratingly starts to shift, becoming less of the slow-burn suspense we got in “Get Out” and more of the lowest-common-denominator schlock we’ve seen from zombies and vampires of monster movies past. Act 2 still offers moments of bloody delight and inspired choices, particularly a bubbly soundtrack that runs counterpoint to the grisly action, like Kubrick’s use of “Singin’ in the Rain” in “A Clockwork Orange” (1971). Here, it’s the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations,” which cuts to a hilarious Alexa joke that we refuse to spoil. Not only does the tone shift, the “rules of magic” slowly start to unravel with plot holes and logical inconsistencies that undermine the otherwise brilliant twists of Act 3. For instance, why do some dopplegangers move in unison with the humans (i.e. the son), while others are able to move freely? By the end, their exact origins remain sketchy even after the ultimate reveal. The entire construct feels half-baked and not fully formed. By the time we reach the White Swan vs. Black Swan ballerina showdown a la “Black Swan” (2010), we wish that Peele would have given the script another rewrite or two to flesh out the story logic. While “Get Out” sent us out of the theater in awe, many viewers will leave “Us” scratching their heads in confusion. Don’t worry, there are still plenty of Peele’s symbolic visual staples: reproductive rabbits, untethering scissors, the speedboat name “Craw Daddy,” toy ambulances and the numbers 11:11, including the time on digital clocks, an 11-11 baseball score and the mystery Bible verse Jeremiah 11:11: “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.” This doom exists from the opening image of a TV set (i.e. “Poltergeist”) showing a 1986 “Hands Across America” commercial, which comes full circle in the closing image as a subversive analogy for President Donald Trump’s border wall. When the shadow family is asked their identity, they simply respond, “We are Americans.” Thus, the title “Us” should be read as “U.S.” This larger social commentary is timely, exposing the class divides of two parallel worlds, one of privilege, one of plight, unfolding in simultaneous realities. And yet, like Darren Aronofsky’s “mother!” (2017), the underlying metaphors never fully gel with the surface-level A-story plot, which is what “Get Out” did so well, marrying the surface ride with the hidden symbolic layers. “Us” is more of a straight slasher genre piece, for better or worse, but it’s no sophomore slump because it proves Peele’s vocabulary of consistent auteur trademarks. If we watched it before “Get Out,” the result might have impressed us as a lowbrow horror/comedy by one half of Key & Peele. But now that we’re watching it after the elevated experience of “Get Out,” there’s a slight air of disappointment selfishly crying out, “Another masterpiece please!” Alas, you can’t hit a home run every time. “Us” is still very much worth a watch — a genius firing on most cylinders is a better use of your time than lesser filmmakers at their best. Just expect a suspenseful, nightmarish, even puzzling ride with more questions than answers. I have a hunch audience scores are going to be more mixed than the critical raves thus far. What we have here is M. Night Shyamalan after his “Sixth Sense” breakthrough akin to “Get Out.” Plenty of juicy twists await, but can anything ever match it? Either way, it’s exciting to have a new auteur in the horror genre where we can’t wait to see what he does next.",HLU_Doc8_US,HLU,Horror,Negative,US
188,HLU_Doc9_US,"Writer-director Jordan Peele’s 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he’s got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we’re stuck there with him. Lupita Nyong’o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they’re heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide’s childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of “shadow” people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth’s surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs. The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it’s impossible to address any of the movie’s larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile, “What are you people?” “We are Americans,” the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl. That’s a bright, neon-lit Author’s Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn’t necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don’t live at the same comfort level—or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movie’s threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesn’t always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isn’t always fun to watch; there are stretches where it’s plodding and dour. He’s overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you don’t know it outright, it’s the one that goes, “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.”) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, you’re not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe it’s just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because there’s a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing. One thing that’s unquestionable: Peele is a dazzling visual stylist. (Peele’s cinematographer is Mike Gioulakis, who also shot David Robert Mitchell’s It Follows, as well as M. Night Shyamalan’s Split and Glass.) The movie’s opening, which details young Adelaide’s nightmare—it takes place in a ghoulish hall of mirrors on the Santa Cruz boardwalk—is a mini-horror masterpiece by itself, an evocation of the outright weirdness of childhood rather than its wonder: As the girl wanders away from her parents, in an almost trancelike state, she clutches a candied apple so shiny it’s like blood-red crystal ball—and puts us in a trance, too. Yet the rest of Us is laden with metaphors, and they pile up so quickly that not even Peele can keep up with them. The movie repeatedly references Hands Across America, a 1986 benefit event in which some 6.5 million people joined hands along a route mapped out across the contiguous United States. (Many participants had donated $10 to reserve a space in the chain; the money was donated to local charities dedicated to fighting hunger and ending poverty.) In Us, the shadow people form a similar chain. But it’s hard to know what Peele is trying to say with that image. Are the semi-zombies of Us just less fortunate versions of us? Are they actually us and we don’t know it? Is their clumsy anger somehow superior to thought and reason? After all, it has unified them, while we aboveground humans are more divided than ever. How, in the end, are we supposed to feel about these shadow people, for so long deprived of basic human rights—including daylight—that they have become murderous clones? Sometimes great movies are ambiguous, but ambiguity resulting from unclear thinking makes nothing great. It’s one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it’s another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say.",HLU_Doc9_US,HLU,Horror,Negative,US
189,HLU_Doc10_US,"I would love to be able to say that Jordan Peele’s Us is a worthy follow-up to his fantastic directorial debut Get Out, but I’m afraid I just can’t. After a genuinely creepy first half, the film very quickly devolves into tedium and over-explanation. It feels directionless, as though Peele created a fantastic horror scenario that he didn’t know what to do with. As such, the film plods along, repeating the same beats over and over, until Peele decides somewhat arbitrarily to just get it over with. The story involves a family vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz. Endearingly-clueless father, Gabe (Winston Duke), attempts to connect with his kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), while his wife, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), becomes increasingly agitated. She has a traumatic history with the nearby beach boardwalk and doesn’t want her own children to be hurt, as well. Things quickly spiral out of control, though, as their home is invaded by another family that looks exactly like them. It is during these moments – as the family is coming to grips with the surreal situation they’re in – that the film excels. Peele shows himself more than capable of ratcheting up the tension until we just can’t take it anymore. However, as he starts to widen the scope of the story, more explanation is needed to make sense of these strange goings-on. Peele does try to keep things interesting with the occasional action set piece, but it all begins to feel perfunctory and repetitive. Eventually, I found myself losing interest to the point that I genuinely no longer cared about what I was watching. The actors are not to blame here. Every member of the cast is quite capable, though I do wish that many of them were given more to do. We get a general idea of who the kids are, but we never truly feel like we know them. And Gabe isn’t really explored beyond the superficial “dorky dad” archetype. It is only the character of Adelaide that we are allowed to get to know, and Lupita Nyong’o perfectly captures the character’s strength and emotional fragility. She is palpably frightened throughout the film, yet is able to muster up a very realistic courage that never denies that fear, but simply fights through it. Adelaide is an interesting character, and Nyong’o’s performance carries the film. With such a game cast and haunting tone, I just wish that the film had amounted to more. Being confronted with one’s own doppelgänger is a tried-and-true horror premise, and a deeply effective one, because it invites the audience to examine the darker aspects of itself. But it has to remain an intimate affair, lest it become impersonal and generic. Sadly, by broadening the story, it becomes less specific to these characters and their issues and begins to feel more like the director is pontificating, actively rejecting story in favor of theme.  It is possible to make such choices work, but I don’t think Peele quite knows how yet. Horror is a tricky genre, which can allow a filmmaker to explore all manner of cultural, psychological, and political themes. But it needs to be balanced just right, or else key elements get lost. And I think Us loses its sense of urgency the bigger it gets. Peele seems to realize this, and he decides to bring the story back to Adelaide as she grapples with her traumatic past. It’s a smart move, but one that is undercut by a reveal that is lifted straight out of Treehouse of Horror on The Simpsons, and made all the more eye-rolling because it is in no way a surprise. While Nyong’o does her best to give this moment weight, she can’t quite overcome the inherent shrug of such a non-revelation. This isn’t to say that Us is totally irredeemable. There is plenty of style and mood to suggest that Jordan Peele continues to have a bright future as a filmmaker. Unfortunately, when comparing this film to his stellar debut, I’m not quite as excited for his next film as I was for this one, and that bright future has begun to dim ever so slightly.",HLU_Doc10_US,HLU,Horror,Negative,US
170,DKX_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,"Stephen King took 1,138 pages to tell the story of It, his 1986 horror classic about an evil clown called Pennywise who torments a group of children in Maine. But director Andy Muschietti always seems pressed for time, both in his 2017 adaptation of the first quarter or so of It and now in this far more expansive sequel, which runs nearly three hours. It Chapter Two is a much grander project than the first film, for it encompasses the main characters as both children and adults. The main problem with the initial movie was that Bill Skarsgards Pennywise was too much a special effect and too little a taunting and evil human in clown makeup, but in It Chapter Two, Skarsgard is allowed to make much more of a contribution. The second half of the 1990 TV miniseries of It, which dealt with the child characters as adults, was much weaker than the first; It Chapter Two is stronger than its predecessor, partly because the adult actors give it so much emotional intensity, particularly James McAvoy as the grown-up Bill Denbrough and Jessica Chastain as the adult Beverly. It is also more impressive because Muschietti focuses more on intimate psychological horror and less on spectacle. Some very upsetting things happen in the first hour of It Chapter Two, none more so than the brutal gay-bashing and murder of the defiant Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan), which King based on the real-life hate-crime murder of Charlie Howard in Bangor, Maine, in 1984. Muschietti does not soft-pedal this sequence in any way, and he does not allow us to look away from the very abusive relationship in which Chastains adult Beverly finds herself. Kings It takes the conception of evil very seriously and follows it to the most primal conclusions. Pennywise is strong because he lives on the fear of his victims, and he plays on weaknesses without mercy, like the worst kind of bully. The evil of Pennywise is linked to the evil of the homophobic gay bashers and of Beverlys violent husband, but this is never simplistic. Dolans Mellon is not at all afraid of the bigots who kill him, while Beverly is not so much afraid of her husband as numb to him.Probably the best and the scariest sequence in It Chapter Two is also one of the simplest. Chastains Beverly goes back to her childhood home, where she is greeted by an elderly woman named Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson) who insists on inviting Beverly in for tea. Beverly looks around a bit, and when she sits down for the tea, Mrs. Kershs face seems to freeze slightly, as if she has begun to somehow malfunction. Muschietti seems to have realized that what Gregson is able to do with her face here, as a performer, is much more frightening than anything he might be able to do with a special effect. And this realization extends to what happens next, when Beverly finds herself trapped in a hallway with Skarsgards Pennywise sitting down at the end of it. Pennywise is without his usual makeup, and he wears her fathers clothes and hair. He becomes Beverlys abusive father here and speaks to her as her father until he starts to put on his clown make-up, and this is far more frightening as a visual idea than all of the other set pieces in this movie involving very elaborate and expensive-looking effects of insects with human faces and large statues that come to life. What stands out in It Chapter Two is not the clearly labored-over insect effects but that moment with Mrs. Kersh and the scene of Pennywise as Beverlys father  both reliant on actors rather than technical wizardry. The human eye can tell that there is not much in effects but effects themselves with a story like this about evil. But an actor like Gregson or Skarsgard can channel evil for us because they are human, and so therefore are presumably familiar with evil and can show it under controlled conditions to an audience. The strength of the King material is that it is without sentimentality; any bit of happiness here has to be earned through suffering and sometimes with wrenching sacrifice. King himself appears in It Chapter Two as a shop owner. He looks skinny, slightly stunned, harsh and un-smiling, a master of the macabre, and likely pleased with the success of these new It movies, financially and otherwise. If Muschiettis achievement with these two features is one more of managerial smarts and problem-solving than anything else, still his skill and control is welcome. And surely Muschiettis It and It Chapter Two will both play better when seen together with added footage for the streaming release of his directors cuts, when he wont have to worry so much about running times.",DKX_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
171,DKX_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,"It Chapter One, or whatever we must call it since it made enough millions to birth a chapter two, had its crutches. This was an adaptation of (half of) a beloved book, following in the footsteps of a so-so yet affectionately remembered TV movie, leaning heavily into the never-ending wave of 1980s nostalgia. It all seemed a little safe, never completely its own entity. Yet it overcame this. As Amblin-lite as it was, It starred a winning cast of kids and went to town with classic Stephen King explorations of domestic trauma. And while never totally terrifying, it boasted a boogeyman for the ages, Bill Skarsgard wearing Pennywise like a second skin. A horror with heart, It stormed the cinema gates, and the novels second timeline, featuring the Losers grown up and back on the clown-conquering beat, was aggressively greenlit. And now, director Andy Muschiettis shackles are off. It Chapter Two is all about crutches. A quick recap of the first films epilogue is followed by some voiceover from the adult Mike (Mustafa). Sometimes, we are what we wish we could forget, he says. Mike has remained in Derry, but in the 27 years since, the rest of the Losers have split, none of them in touch with each other, all having moved on. In some ways, at least. The adult Losers get great intros, Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman presenting distinct personalities in precise sequences: having been out of contact for three decades, Mike, obsessed with events throughout, telephones them all with grim news from Derry, resulting in puking, car-crashing and all-round panic. From Bill Haders Richie, now professionally wisecracking on comedy stages, to Jessica Chastains Beverly, still sadly suffering abuse, to James McAvoys sensitive screenwriter Bill, the success of every re-casting is immediately apparent  all of these characters feel instantly lived-in, vibrant, authentic human beings who you buy from the off. But there the comfort ends. Before we reunite with the Losers, the film itself begins in Derry with a brutal, bone-crunching homophobic attack. More disturbing than anything in chapter one, it announces at once that Muschietti is not playing it safe at all. It is decidedly adult territory, enormously troubling to witness, let alone when its married to an even more gruesome, otherworldly coda. This opening does everything horror should do, leaving you shaken mere minutes after the film has begun. Muschietti more-or-less keeps this going throughout its near three-hour runtime. Genre-wise, Chapter Two delights in itself, just as the book did. King conceived It as a final exam on horror, throwing in all the monsters people were afraid of when he was growing up. Muschietti seems equally in debt to decades of cinematic horror, 1970s and 1980s films being particular influences. There are exquisitely executed scares with the various ghouls, from unsettling background spine-chillers to full-force frightmares. It is both classy and disgusting, the creature design wonderfully inventive, all in the service of scaring you. These, though, are the sideshows. Mere supporting acts for a horrendous headliner. Pennywise is a real motherfucker in this film. An absolute horrible bastard of a clown. His first appearance is surprisingly nasty, and then so are all the others. Much of his heightened impact here is because more of Skarsgard has been allowed to shine through. This is Heath Ledger-levels of character ownership. A brilliant physical performer, he inhabits Pennywise to diabolical degrees, and the effects, both practical and computer-generated, are next-level  at one point one of his eyes is slightly off, and its creepy as hell. Yet in another sequence, he appears without any prosthetics at all, just Skarsgard in ghoulish whiteface, and its absurdly horrid. Hes just as scary laid bare. This film is not a deep psychological excavation, but thats fine  its as deep as it needs to be. Its about dealing with your shit, about confronting the things you havent let go, the things youve suppressed, avoided, run from. Pennywise preys on these personal demons, in ways that are much more elemental than before. Muschietti explored childhood fears with the first film, but the sequel steps things up  there are now years of trauma for Pennywise to poke at. There is more meanness to his tapping into the Losers troubles, and their nightmarish excursions feel much more embedded in the story. There was a disconnect to the set-pieces in the first film, but here Pennywise is more integrated, more overtly involved in it all. It all reminds you of how good Stephen King is at this stuff. As much as Muschietti comes into his own with this film, it is nevertheless constantly bubbling over with Kings DNA, and whilst Muschietti tightens the books focus, he doesnt cut corners. That threatens to derail it as things progress. With seven Losers, and two versions of each over two timelines  there are flashbacks throughout  there is a lot to wrangle. King intentionally took a kitchen-sink approach with the book, hence its 1,138 pages. Muschietti makes it work  his flashbacks complement the present day, the two periods dancing with each other, illuminating each other, beefing up the emotional resonance  but at one point the film feels like it might wear itself out a smidge. And as it heads into a more fantastical arena, it feels in danger of buckling under the weight of its own silliness. But. Then. Just as it seems it might be on the verge of losing itself, as the book dictates, it goes fabulously apeshit. What madness it brings. As the film builds towards a nutty climax, there is a whole heap of Grand Guignol insanity, with unashamedly grand, godlike images. It is glorious to see this stuff envisioned on such a huge and self-assured scale, a joy to have a film of this size trading in this sort of genre carnage with such uncompromising and unapologetic style. Confidence runs through Chapter Two. The (almost) contemporary setting means its less burdened by superficial nostalgia, allowing Muschietti to more forcefully own it, and its tonally perfect. Comedy aside  humour often undercuts the horror, mostly successfully  there is little brightness here, the film shrouded in shadow. Everything conspires to creep you out. Nothing is spared with the set design, especially as things get weird: you can taste the dankness. It is unforgivingly tense, giving you both shivers and jumps. It is spooky on a gut level. Yet for all the darkness, the sweetness survives. The film has much affection for these Losers, and as an ode to friendship  or at least to age-old bonds  it does fine work. With so many leads, the emotion is handled economically, but sincerely. Muschietti walks a constant tightrope. He never falls off.",DKX_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
172,DKX_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,"Guess whos back, back againIT Chapter One was both a box office and critical hit, quickly becoming the highest-grossing horror film of all time. Andy Muschiettis adaptation of Stephen Kings beloved novel proved a winning combination of 80s nostalgia and scares (with heart), leading to the birth of a modern horror blockbuster, winning over this absolute wimp in the process! Two years later and Muschietti is back with a brand new, star studded cast in this ambitious and highly anticipated sequel, but does the second outing successfully recapture the magic of the original, whilst simultaneously wrapping the terrifying tale up? Twenty-seven years after the horrific events that occurred in the town of Derry and children begin to mysteriously disappear again, in often gruesome circumstances. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of The Losers Club to stay in the town, instantly recognizes the spate of juvenile murders, signifying his worst nightmare  the inevitable return of Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). Armed with the knowledge of how to defeat the clown for good, he reunites the rest of the now grown-up Losers, who must overcome their greatest fears and band together to defeat the evil that reigns over the town. IT Chapter Two is a bigger, bolder and more chilling outing that delves much deeper into the horror aspects of the source material. The film features plenty of nightmare fueled visions that will definitely stick with you long after the film ends, believe me! The horror sequences were truly gripping, successfully heightening each of your senses  I was genuinely on the edge of my seat for a lot of the third act, which showcased some truly brutal visuals. There were also a number of weird and wonderful Pennywise manifestation which wildly ranged in size and creepiness; some were truly unnerving whereas others (mainly a naked Mrs. Kersh) actually made me giggle, maybe out of nervousness! Along with the scares, Muschietti continues to flesh out Kings key theme of facing your fear to overcome personal demons. It kills monster if you believe it does Beverly encouragingly tells Eddie in one touching scene, highlighting the fact that the Losers once again need each other to face Pennywise. Theres also a defining sweet melancholy to this film, highlighting the loss of childhood innocence through cleverly interwoven flashbacks in important moments of the narrative. Tonally though, its a bit of a strange combination of horror and mythology with comedy and heart, with this mismatch also reflecting in the pacing of the film. Yes Chapter Two clocks in at an impressive 2 hours and 50 minutes, and although it doesnt necessarily feel like too long a film, there was definitely a slow build up to the main action. Those that loved the brilliant chemistry of the original kids  fear not, the casting of the older Losers Club is absolutely perfect, scarily so at times! James Ransone wonderfully captures the neurotic mannerisms of Jack Dylan Grazers Eddie, once again replicating that endearing banter with Bill Haders Richie. Surprisingly though, Hader steals the majority of the scenes with his hilarious turn as the wise cracking comedian, providing some much needed comic relief to break up the tension. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain really do immerse themselves in their roles; at times I thought Chastains fear in one particular scene was genuine and McAvoys inability to forgive himself for what happened in the past was truly tragic. But the real star was Pennywise himself, Bill Skarsgard, who completely embodies the hellish being. Even without the makeup hes utterly terrifying, proving a true physical performer to rival Andy Serkis Gollum. Overall, IT Chapter 2 is a terrifying horror that genuinely gets under your skin. As previously alluded to, Im not usually one for this genre, but I found myself truly engrossed thanks to the excellent (and tender) performances from the stellar cast. Remember, youre braver than you think!",DKX_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
173,DKX_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,"Why isnt Pennywise the clown as terrifying in It Chapter Two as he was in the first half of this story? Maybe its because when Pennywise bares his teeth and zeroes in on a potential victim, its easier to feel empathy when the potential victim is a kid from Stranger Things and not Bill Hader. And I love Bill Hader. Dont get me wrong: theres still a lot of life (and death) left in the creepy-ass entity with the light-bulb-shaped head. Theres no shortage of jump-from-your-seat GOTCHA! moments in director Andy Muschiettis sequel to his 2017 horror insta-classic (both movies based on the 1986 Stephen King novel, of course). Yet for all of Muschiettis visual flourishes and with the greatly talented Bill Skarsgard again delivering a madcap, disturbingly effective, all-in performance as the dreaded Pennywise, It: Chapter Two had a relatively muted impact on me. This time around, the main storyline takes place when our beloved Losers Club are no longer kids  theyre a bunch of 40ish, neurotic, wisecracking, self-aware adults. Even as theyre fighting for their survival, they cant help but acknowledge how theres something inherently ludicrous about them facing off against a clown most people cant see. Still, this is a solid, extremely well-crafted, great-looking and occasionally quite chilling film, with terrific performances by the grown-ups as well as the returning kids. After a brutal and nasty (and narratively unnecessary) prologue, we catch up with the various members of the Losers Club some 27 years after the events of the first film. Lets take a look at your opening day roster: James McAvoy is Bill, the former leader of the Losers Club, who has become a best-selling mystery novelist  although readers (including his wife) are always telling him he doesnt know how to end a story. (Jaeden Martell returns as young Bill.) Jessica Chastain is Beverly, who was abused by her father and was the subject of hateful rumors at school. Beverly has become a successful fashion designer but has been trapped in a horrific marriage with an abusive husband. (Sophia Lillis is young Beverly.) Bill Hader as the foul-mouthed smart-aleck Richie, who has put his talents to good use as a popular stand-up comic. (Finn Wolfhard is little Richie.) Jay Ryan is the formerly overweight, picked-on Ben, who has become a hunky architect.(Jeremy Ray Taylor is younger Ben.) James Ransone is the hypochondriac Eddie (with Jack Dylan Grazer as young Eddie); Andy Bean is the reluctant Losers Club member Stanley (Wyatt Oleff is 27-years-ago Stanley); and Isaiah Mustafa is Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs in the flashback scenes), the only member of the Losers to stay in Derry. Convinced Pennywise is back, Mike calls the Losers, who have scattered far and wide, and reminds them of the blood oath they swore more than a quarter-century ago: If the clown of their childhood nightmares resurfaced, they would return to Derry to kill it. Weirdly, Mike seems to be the only one who even recalls what happened when they were kids. The rest barely even remember each other, let alone any of the details of their epic battle against the supernatural clown. That changes when they come home to Derry, and the memories grow ever more clear. The grown-up losers are quickly reminded of Pennywises powerful abilities to get inside their heads when a laugh-filled reunion dinner at a Chinese restaurant turns super-gross (and kinda funny). This scene sets the tone for a series of separate set-pieces in which adult Beverly, Bill, Richie, et al., individually experience moments of absolute terror, all courtesy of Pennywises handiwork. An impromptu knock on the door of a former childhood home, a stop in the town square where a kitschy statue looms large against the sky, the sighting of ones beloved childhood bicycle in a store window  each scene begins relatively innocently before exploding into a waking nightmare that preys on the worst fears and repressed memories of each of the Losers. All good stuff, but more often than not, director Muschietti and the first-rate special effects team deliver gross-out visuals in favor of truly chilling and tense psychological terror. I mean, the Losers have to deal with a LOT of arachnid-inspired imagery. (The scariest scene in the entire 2 hour, 49 minute film is a stand-alone interlude in which a little girl with a birthmark on her face encounters Pennywise under the bleachers at a baseball game, and feels for him because he says he, too, knows what its like to look different.) Chastain as Beverly, Hader as Richie and Mustafa as Mike create the most effective and authentic grown-up versions of the childhood characters. (This is not a knock on the other adult actors; they just feel less connected to the younger versions of themselves.) The production design is rich with detail and wonderfully forbidding. The cinematography conveys a deep and dark sense of doom  even in the bright of day, even when theres a parade or a carnival and everyone seems to be having such a wonderful time. Even as the second-best chapter in a two-part horror epic, this is a movie with enough scare power to tap you on your subconscious just before you fall asleep tonight.",DKX_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
174,DKX_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,"Its been twenty-seven years since the Losers Club thought they defeated Pennywise the clown. Now, hes back and taking children again. The friends are called back to reunite in Derry to try to stop It once again. As they remember their past, the old friends will have to face the monster head-on to break the cycle and save the children of Derry and themselves. The second half of Stephen Kings legendary novel is yet again brought to life in IT Chapter Two by screenwriter Gary Dauberman (The Nun, Annabelle Comes Home) and director Andy Muschietti (IT [2017], Mama). The film begins right where the previous film left off, with the Losers Club together in the field right after defeating Pennywise for the first time. After seeing a sign from Pennywise, the only person in the group to have stayed in Derry, Mike, calls his friends and reminds them of the promise they made all those years ago. From there the film weaves back and forth between the past and the present as each member of the group is called and brought home, then as their long-forgotten childhood memories finally come back to them. The way the plot is integrated with past and present is done perfectly in a way that still allows the film to naturally flow and move forward. Dauberman and Muschietti do a fantastic job of including the important scenes and aspects of the source material, while still giving audiences something new. It allows the filmmakers to capture the spirit and feel of the book, even if it is not an exact adaptation. In several scenes, fans of the book will recognize what is happening. Yet there are still many exciting new things that did not come from Kings novel. Some of the changes were entire scenes, while others were more subtle, but impactful changes in the characters. One specific aspect of the novel I know many people were curious to see in the film is the ritual of Chud. Without giving away too many details, they do reference the ritual and have it in the film, but it might not be quite what fans of the novel expect. The climax of the film is thrilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. It pays homage to Kings work, but changes things up in order to give fans something unexpected and new. Considering the IT Chapter Two has an almost three hour run time, somehow the film still felt like it went by very quickly. This is great because it means that, despite the long run time and everything they are able to include, the film is exciting and intriguing enough to keep the audience interested. Yet it also almost feels like many aspects of the film were simply brushed over instead of giving them the more in-depth look they deserved. Considering the length of the source material and how much the filmmakers were able to include in the film, I still applaud this cinematic achievement. Fans of the first film were likely blown away by the kids performances. The adults in IT Chapter Two are no different. Of course, everyone knew James McAvoy (Split, Dark Phoenix) and Jessica Chastain (Mama, Mollys Game) as adult Bill and Bev would be phenomenal. Jay Ryan (Beauty and the Beast, Terra Nova), who plays adult Ben, is one of the least known actors in the Losers Club. What makes his performance so great is how much he is able to convey more than words can with just a look, even when the camera is focused on other characters. James Ransone (Insidious, Generation Kill) is perfect casting as adult Eddie and comes across as the same person as the child we saw in the first film. One of the most surprising performances comes from Isaiah Mustafa (Chuck, Shadowhunters) as adult Mike. He is unrecognizeable as the Old Spice guy in this role. Not only does his character get more spotlight than his younger counterpart in the first film, but Mustafa is clearly up to the task and shines in the role. All of these actors are fantastic, but Bill Hader (Trainwreck, Barry) as adult Richie will be the one audiences remember most. Hader is absolutely hilarious, adding some great laugh out loud moments in the middle of the most tense moments. Yet what makes his performance so amazing is the emotional depth he conveys beyond the humor on the surface. Last, but not least, it is important to mention Bill Skarsgard (Castle Rock, IT [2017]) as Pennywise the clown. Just like his performance in the first film, Skarsgard manages to play what is likely the most terrifying clown in movie history. Between practical effects, CGI, sets, and Easter eggs, IT Chapter Two has many stunning visual elements. As with the first film, the many terrifying creatures and characters IT appears as are a fantastic combination of practical effects and CGI enhancement. The two modes combine seamlessly to create some of the most shocking, disgusting, and frightening imagery. The filmmakers utilize familiar sets from the first film, such as the barrens and the house on Niebolt Street, but also incorporate gorgeous new ones. Some of the most memorable sets are the elegant old inn and the place deep underground where the final showdown takes place. The film also utilizes some really fascinating transitions. These transitions allow the filmmakers to maneuver from the past to the present and back again in unique, beautiful ways. One of the most intriguing visual aspects of IT Chapter Two is the many Easter eggs hidden throughout. Some of these are characters in the film with small cameos, including Muschietti himself and the actor who played young Ben in the 1990 IT miniseries, Brandon Crane, and one cameo I will leave as a surprise. Other Easter eggs are references to the 1990 IT and other popular films from the 80s. One especially memorable moment is a creature that is a combination of practical and CGI effects that appears to be an Easter egg or homage to John Carpenters The Thing. IT Chapter Two is a thrilling and heart-felt conclusion to the story of our favorite losers that captures the feel of Kings novel while still giving us something exciting and new. Muschietti and Dauberman clearly know how to tell a compelling story that has a strong emotional core, amazing sets and effects, tons of scares, and even more laughs. They also honor Kings work by creating this cultural phenomenon of a film for horror fans and non-horror fans alike to adore. Every single actor embodies the characters they play in a way that reminds us of the children from the first film. And, of course, Skarsgard still brings the terror with his unique and terrifying portrayal of Pennywise. Purists who want an exact adaptation of the book or fans who are devoted to the miniseries may not be thrilled by the film, but this film is undoubtedly one of the horror highlights of 2019.",DKX_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
175,DKX_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,"At what point do scary things lose their power? That's a question It Chapter Two asks on a thematic level as it finishes up Stephen King's saga about a mythical beast that takes the form of a freaky clown to feed on fear. It's also a query that can be posed to the film itself, which, at nearly three hours, neuters Pennywise's terror, slogging along to a conclusion that starts to feel both inevitable and like it will never actually arrive. Once again helmed by Andy Muschietti, the second It picks up on the now forty-something members of the Losers Club 27 years after the events of the first film. When Pennywise returns to their hometown of Derry, aiding and abetting in a grisly hate crime, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the one Loser left in small-town Maine, calls up his erstwhile pals to come and fight. The trouble is, no one other than Mike remembers what befell them when they were tweens, a side effect of wrestling with It, thus forcing them all to reckon with their childhood traumas while battling the shapeshifting ""It."" It's not exactly a waltz down memory lane. Despite covering only one bit of an extremely lengthy book, the 2017 initial installment in Muschietti's saga felt strangely complete, updating the action from the 1950s to the 1980s and focusing solely on the Losers as kids, portrayed by the likes of Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, and Jaeden Martell. Chapter Two casts grown-up versions of Richie, Bev, and Bill -- played by Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, and James McAvoy, respectively -- but refuses to let childhood go completely, interspersing numerous flashbacks that seems to reiterate what was previously covered in just a slightly different manner. The caliber of the new cast is invariably the draw of the sequel. Chastain is an Oscar nominee who had demonstrable chemistry with McAvoy in the 2014 indie The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby; meanwhile, Hader's Emmy-winning work on Barry has made him one of the most exciting actors on any screen. Still, by virtue of the storytelling, the adult actors aren't really allowed the chance to gel in the way their younger counterparts are, and thus the fun of watching them all together is dulled. Among the cast additions -- which also include Jay Ryan as Ben and James Ransone as Eddie -- Hader is the standout, bringing a twitchy energy to jokester Richie, who has grown up to be a hacky stand-up, peddling other people's jokes. But even he is hamstrung by Gary Dauberman's screenplay, which awkwardly veers between thrills, laughs, and serious exploration of topics like abuse and homophobia. Whereas King's text spans the cosmos, dealing with his godlike turtle force known as Maturin, Muschietti chooses to keep the action grounded -- or at least as grounded as murderous clowns can be. The only hint of psychedelia comes in the form of the Ritual of Chüd, a way of defeating It handed down to Mike from a Native American tribe, represented in grossly stereotypical fashion. (Bizarrely, despite the fact that action now takes place in the present, the tone of Chapter Two seems grounded in the less-woke '80s.) To obliterate It, the Losers are each required to get a totem from their childhoods, leading to lengthy sequences where almost all of them come face-to-face with both the past versions of themselves and a wild monster. This time Muschietti seems intent going bigger and broader with the scares, transforming It into an oversized old woman and a black-tongued leper. But the beats are so repetitive that it's easy, as an audience member, to grown numb to the frights. There's nothing with as much ingenuity as, say, the projector sequence from the last go-around. Bill Skarsgard's utterly creepy performance as Pennywise remains unmatched, but too frequently, it's jettisoned in favor of barnstorming CGI. The oddest part of Chapter Two is that, despite its length, it fails to earn the ""epic"" status it so wishes to earn. Which isn't to say it's all bad. There are moments of icky scares, and everyone on screen at least seems to be having fun, but when it's all over you can't help thinking: Didn't we do this already?",DKX_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
176,DKX_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,"Nearly 90 years ago in Fritz Langs M, a single balloon snagged in the telephone wires high above Berlin was enough to suggest a childs murder. Audiences today wouldnt settle for such discretion, and nor are they asked to in It Chapter Two, the second half of the film version of Stephen Kings 1986 horror novel. Before the opening sequence is done, hundreds of red balloons have already drifted through the town of Derry, Maine. The message Come Home, Come Home has also been daubed in blood on a wall, which means either theres a seriously committed fan of the Manchester band James on the loose, or that Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgard) is up to his old tricks. Not that hes been honking the horn on his collapsing jalopy or squirting water from the flower in his lapel. He isnt that kind of clown. Hes more the dragging-kids-into-sewers type, the sort that tends not to get quite so much work on the birthday party circuit. A group of adolescent misfits known as the Losers Club defeated Pennywise at the end of the previous movie, promising that if he ever returned they would regroup to try again. Or, to put it another way, if the first part of It did well, theyd make another. Sure enough, $700m at the box office later and here they are as adults, including Richie (Bill Hader), who is now a stand-up comic, Beverly (Jessica Chastain), who is fleeing a violent marriage, and the novelist Bill (James McAvoy), whose brother was murdered by Pennywise. Its a shame to say goodbye for the most part to the excellent young actors from the earlier film, especially when the on-screen chemistry in the new one suggests that their older counterparts only met for the first time a moment before shooting. The gang hold their big reunion at a Chinese restaurant where an entire Pokémon deck of bizarre, gooey creatures hatches out of the fortune cookies, among them a mewling baby head attached to a crabs body, and an eyeball with slithering tentacles. Imagine the TripAdvisor reviews after that meal. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) reveals that he has been in touch with the areas Native American tribe and has the low-down on defeating Pennywise for good. Native American people are much beloved by film-makers for their connotations of mysticism, though they are not beloved enough in this case to be given speaking parts, or to be shown as anything other than spooky silhouettes in an expository montage. What they have advised is that each of the gang must delve into the past and contribute an artefact to be sacrificed in a ritual burning. Thats six gang members, each with their own flashbacks and hallucinations, plus some arbitrary murders which bear no relation to the main narrative, adding up to a running time just shy of three hours. A horror film that relies on Boo! moments and visual overkill rather than modulations in pacing or suspense has no business asking audiences to stay engaged for that long, and its only to be expected that individually eye-catching images are lost in this carnival of unvarying excess. Trying to recall the separate spectacles of the preceding hours will turn any viewer into a contestant during the conveyor belt round of The Generation Game: Haunted fortune cookies haunted skateboard severed head that sprouts legs like the one in The Thing statue of Paul Bunyan that springs to life charred ogre with pendulous breasts fondue set cuddly toy. Each new monstrosity cancels out the previous one, making the horrific merely ho-hum. It also has the effect of trivialising the needlessly graphic scenes of domestic and homophobic violence. Whats a punch to a womans face or a few kicks to a gay characters head when weve seen a zombie vomiting black goo to the tune of Angel of the Morning? But the most extreme horrors of all are confined to Gary Daubermans screenplay. Its difficult to respect any writer who opens a scene cold with the line: What do you mean youve seen all of us die? Humour in Daubermans estimation is represented by someone interrupting a sombre discussion to ask, So what did I miss? or pushing at a door when the sign reads Pull. Following a murder in a library, Richie quips: That was overdue. Entering a haunted house, he says: Love what hes done with the place. If the characters in a horror film arent going to bother to be scared, there seems little incentive for us to be frightened either. During the climax, Richie and friends are faced with three doors, one marked Scary, another Very Scary and the third Not Scary At All. The door that was chosen by the makers of It Chapter Two  Shrill, Overlong, Largely Without Merit  seems not to be an option. A sprinkling of star cameos, including the directors Peter Bogdanovich and Xavier Dolan, as well as King himself as an amiable old coot, provoke a smile but wont be enough to prevent discerning viewers from saying: It just isnt good enough. I cant take It any more. Im over It.",DKX_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
177,DKX_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,"When the seven far-flung members of the so-called Losers Club get the call to come back home to Derry, Maine, and face their fears, everyone panics. Thats childhood trauma, for you. Richie (Bill Hader), a comedian now, gets the call before he goes onstage for a set; he throws up, then bombs. Eddie (James Ransone), a high-functioning neurotic and hypochondriac, crashes his car in Manhattan. Another member of this once-teenage tribe kills himself that same night. Its a nice toucha hint at what, if anything, makes the premise of the It franchise, which resumes this week with Andy Muschiettis Chapter Two, so scary. Only when we see Pennywise the Dancing Clown in the gutters of Derry, lurking, hiding in wait to rip the arms off of children, do we get an uncanny shiver; only when he lures a young girl under the bleachers to manipulate and mutilate her, in Chapter Two, do we feel the kind of fear that would make grown men vomit and total their cars at the mere memory. But even that stuff is less effective than the grown Losers fear itself, a terror their fellow loser Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa)who never left Derry reveals to be the fear of a sublime, ancient secret. Its Pennywise, yesbut of course, neither Stephen Kings mammoth 1986 novel, a staple of my own adolescence, or 2017s It (also directed by Muschietti) leave it at that. This is a story that started in the late 80s, fashioning a humble but mighty clique of heroes out of a group of social outcasts. They were kids with problemsan abusive father, a little brother murdered by Pennywisethat the clever clown used against them. It was a 7-way haunted house of a film: each child had to survive his or her own private struggle against the grinning ghoul, with the ribs of the films plot dedicated to detailing those struggles one by one. The new movie, set 27 years later, is much the sameonly twice as crowded. Because now we have adults to deal with, on top of those distant childhood selves. Rounding the group out is Bill (James McAvoy), de facto leader of the Losers, whose brother was killed by Pennywise three decades ago; Bev (Jessica Chastain), who survived an abusive father only, it seems, to fall into the hands of an abusive husband; and the shy, handsome Ben Hansom (Jay Ryan), a former fat kid who, now as when he was a teenager, cant stop thinking about Bev. There isnt truly standout work from anyone in the cast, even if the cast is what makes the movie work when it does work. Thank God for Haders unassuming sense of humor, Ransones jitteriness, Chastains steely, intuitive resolve. Its all in service of the familiarbut if, you already know this story, isnt that the main attraction? The Losers come back to face their fears; they uncover things they didnt know about each other, to say nothing of themselves; they spark new romances and get clarity on old ones; they rely on mutual trust and sacrifice to fight a giant clown. Pennywise, pied piper of childhood nightmares, leads the Losers back to the truths of themselves like a psychoanalyst charging by the minute. Which is interesting in theory. But It is also an unwieldy and strange source text: a sensitive, impassioned study of childhood friendship and trauma wrapped in a goofy campfire tale about an age-old evil disguised as a dancing clown. Muschiettis new film sometimes translates all that well, particularly in a startling opening sequence adapted directly from the booka brutal gay bashing that unexpectedly sparks a visit from Pennywise. The incident implies that Pennywise isnt an aberration, but an extension of the violence we wreak on ourselvesnot a bad point, though Chapter Two also reminds us that violence against gay men is easier to depict onscreen than meaningful interaction between them. Overall, though, the movie is too long for a story whose structure we can predict from the outset; the only way it can play out, really, is character by character, fear by fear. But the real problem, the real catch, is that the hijinks themselves, while spooky, feel largely out of touch and beside the point. The movies special effects have a doughy, rough clumsiness thats both charminglike watching retro claymation ghouls tumble around onscreenand shoddy. Scenes of hallucinated horror over a group feast, or of a visit to a childhood home that turns into a face-to-face meeting with the undead, touch on something genuine, but the effects give you little to sink into beyond googly eyes and a dead old womans sagging body. You only shrink into your seat for as long as it takes to come to your senses and think, ...What? Thats no fault of Bill Skarsgards Pennywise, whos fun when hes having fun. In Chapter Two, he delivers another grab bag of otherworldly chaos, all clown-voiced fury and wiles. Yet over the course of its graceless 2 hour and 49-minute running time, the movie still fails. Its a gruesome, unappetizing fact, but an essential one: real child murder is more horrifying than any slobbering, psychologically suffocating clown, more damning than any mysterious, alien, age-old evil. The scenes in these films that touch on the realities of that violence stick; the rest start receding before your fingers have even scratched the bottom of the popcorn bucket. Theres a running joke in Chapter Two about a writer whos bad at endings. A brief cameo from Stephen King makes it all but impossible to miss that this is a joke about King himselfor at least the King who wrote It, creating a world so magisterially personal and strange that his less-compelling supernatural fixings had nowhere to go but toward a giant spider living out a half-baked ancient myth in a sewer. Is that why Chapter Twos numbing finale, in which the film finally wears out its welcome, is such a deadening rehash of stuff weve seen before? Theres nowhere else to go: history repeats itself, the film tells us. So does trauma. And so, apparently, do movies.",DKX_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
178,DKX_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,"Its wretched, ugly, unseemly and serves no real purpose except to unleash torment on anyone that happens to catch a glimpse. Oh, you think Im referring to Pennywise the Clown? The description also fits IT Chapter 2. Shudder. Granted, most sequels are bloated money-grabs. But this one is a special kind of awful. Perhaps because it squanders all the shagginess from the 2017 original, which was a moody nostalgia piece with fleshed-out characters and unrelenting tension. Though IT only captured the first half of the 1986 Stephen King novel, it felt complete. In a perfect world, the adolescents in the spooky small town of Derry, Maine, would have grown up and dealt with their ordeal via old-fashioned off-screen therapy. Instead, the self-dubbed Losers Club put themselves back in harms way. They suffer for this mistake, as do we. The trouble begins in Act 1, Scene 1, as were forced to watch a heinous and unnecessarily cruel present-day act of gay hate-crime violence that never ever ever should have seen the light of day. (I dont care that the sequence is lifted from the book. Its 2019, and this is not a hard-core indie drama such as Boys Dont Cry.) The only narrative takeaway is that Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) has reappeared, his thirst for blood intact. Now the pals that made that pact 27 years ago to finish IT off for good must live up to the deal. If only it were this easy. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only current Derry resident, meaning he must call all six of his former friends and explain the dire situation. He has all their cell numbers at the ready, even though were led to believe that everybody has been incommunicado with each other since 1989. Bill the stutterer (James McAvoy) is now a mildly successful screenwriter. Richie the jokester (Bill Hader) is a stand-up comic. Beverly the designated tomboy (Jessica Chastain) is stuck in an abusive marriage. The others dont have enough screen-time to warrant a mention. In fact, Mike will essentially disappear from the proceedings as soon as he finishes his phone-tree. Given that Pennywise is up to his old tricks  snatching an innocent small child, shifting his shape to resemble flesh-and-blood people, re-possessing the town bully  youd think that the gang would be in a mad rush to get down to business and defang him. Nope! With a shockingly prolonged run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes, IT Chapter 2 takes its sweet time building up to that inevitable climax. We must see each character have his/her own encounter with Pennywise, which become increasingly predictable and decreasingly frightening. (Be wary of kindly old ladies! Theyre not what you think!). Director Andy Muschietti (IT, Mama) also squeezes in a winking sequence in which Bill buys back his old bike in an antiques store and immediately rides off. With air still in its tires after some 30 years, this must be the most magical bike since the one in E.T. (This is the stuff you ponder when youre watching an overly long movie.) BTW: You may or may not recognize the store owner, depending on your familiarity with literary royalty. Pennywises evils have a numbing effect. We know hes capable of blood-curling murder and yet he lacks a truly scary boogieman appeal compared to, say, Michael Meyers in Halloween. Youve seen one shape-shifting scam, youve seen them all. By the time the adults finally enter his stomping grounds, its a matter of when and how they will destroy him  not whether this evil force will get the best of them. Too bad that he didnt. The Losers Club members are interchangeable and forgettable as grown-ups, as the stars fail to act their way out of a shoddy screenplay. Sure, Hader provides a few morsels of comic relief, but he looks ill at ease doing the oh-my-gosh-help-me! thing in front of a green screen. Chastain has little to do other than speak in hushed tones and look agonized. What a waste of top-tier talent.",DKX_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,DKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
179,DKX_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,"In 2017 Stephen King adaptations took a serious turn for the horrific with the first installment of IT. Perfectly capturing the nostalgia of 80s movies but never forsaking fear or characterization, IT became a horror movie with immense replay value. It also raised the bar high for any subsequent installment that would focus on the second half of Kings book wherein the children grew up into adulthood. Unfortunately IT: Chapter Two tries too hard to please everyone, burdened by the luminosity of its original child actors and desperate to recreate everything you loved in 2017 with everything that needs to be told now. Equal parts bloated and plodding, IT: Chapter Two ends up a disappointing misfire. Twenty-seven years after the first defeat of Pennywise the killer clown, the Losers Club must reunite to get rid of him once and for all. You wouldnt think a film with a premise that simple would command a near-three-hour Avengers-level runtime, and yet thats just the first of many miscues to be found in IT: Chapter Two. The first hour is predominately exposition, showing us what each of the Losers has been doing with themselves for 27 years. Former leader Bill (James McAvoy) is now a screenwriter with an inability to write a good ending, not unlike a particular bespectacled author whose last name rhymes with Cling. His wife is an actressand thats all you need to know about that. Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is a wealthy wife to a man as physically abusive as her father was. Eddie (James Ransone) remains a hypochondriac married to a woman that I still cant tell whether shes the same actress who played his mother or not. Ritchie (Bill Hader) is a successful comedian. Ben (Jay Ryan) is an architect with a six-pack. And Stan (Andy Bean) just wants to do a puzzle and go to Argentina. These summations might sound simplistic and thats because they are. IT: Chapter Two should be about the adult Losers but the script (credited solely to Gary Dauberman) hopes to redo as much of what worked in the original as it can, and that means a lot of flashbacks. Nearly half the movie is told with flashbacks to a brief period from the first movie, wherein the Losers drifted apart during the summer before their final fight with Pennywise at the Neibolt house. Because the kids are now older they cant be brought back to reprise their roles so they all get a healthy dose of de-aging technology applied. The results are frightening, on par with Henry Cavills mustache-free face. The gang has a waxy pallor with the uncanny valley prominent. Some performers, like Jack Dylan Grazier as young Eddie, seem to have their voice altered to sound like they did pre-puberty, giving him a voice mimicking a chipmunk. If this was just one or two scenes it wouldnt be a problem, but these are whole swaths of story were left with. If the powers that be really wanted to do another story with the children then they should have. Instead, the adult storyline in this sequel feels incredibly ancillary. Not only do the adult versions have weak backstories and little history, but their performances range in performance style from bored to completely committed. Ransone and Hader are utterly perfect, if only because they capture what audiences loved about Grazier and Finn Wolfhards performances from the first film. Hader and Ransone have a great rapport together and understand who their characters were as children and how that would apply to them 27 years later. Though it is hard not to see both actors as existing in a completely separate movie because they know their characters. Their roles are showy and flamboyant, where the rest of the cast is incredibly dour and serious. Isaiah Mustafa as Mike Hanlon is good, but his role as the historian is so insulting to see now, considering they gave that role to Ben as a child in the first film (whereas in the book Mike is the one keeping records on Derry). The script hopes you didnt actually watch the first movie as it possesses no explanation as to why Ben gave up history and Mike stayed behind short ofit is that way now. Ryan is certainly good looking but is completely dull as adult Ben. Chastain and McAvoy are both the biggest names and the biggest letdowns. Chastain is solid but her Beverly has nothing to do short of scream and relive the trauma of her youth. McAvoy is the blandest though thats more because his character is so ill-defined, so its unsurprising that his acting feels scattered and basic. If youre wondering how Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is this go-round prepare for sadness. His Pennywise is nothing more than a funhouse character who pops up here and there. The trailers play up additional backstory involving a Derry carnival, but that doesnt go beyond a single scene. Hes presented as nothing more than a kid poking at the various Losers with a stick, throwing out an insult here or there. All of the horror and manipulation is gone, if it wasnt lost in the editing. The road eventually leads to a climax thats equal parts convoluted and contrived. Kings use of Native American rituals and the mystical Negro trope (yep, you thought that was gone in 2019) return with a vengeance for a finale that just feels far too silly to make sense. If its in the book theres nothing earned nor is there groundwork laid for it not to feel like a left-field change in tone. Theres a hope that relying on nostalgia  and outright stealing a key moment from Stand By Me  will make you think it was worth it, but it wont. T: Chapter Two falls under its own weight. The script could have easily used another polish, paring down the exposition and smoothing out some of Kings more outlandish plot contrivances.

10,DRN_Doc1_EQUILIBRIUM,"A tedious rip-off sci-fi film, itching to be another Matrix (or, maybe just a bearable flick!), that brazenly steals everything from Orwell s 1984 novel and many other thinking man s films, with the same Dystopian agenda, such as Fahrenheit 451. It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I ve seen this film s theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre!

Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995- One Man s Justice ), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998- Sphere,  the 1999- The Thomas Crown Affair  and the 2003- The Recruit,  never got this  baby  off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state:  Without love, breath is just a clock ticking ), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of clich s from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It s a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression).

Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he s a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called  Gun-Kata ) going on missions to root out all rebels who haven t taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he s also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge s expected fate is as doomed as Preston s wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner  I spread my dreams under your feet. 

Before you can say  let s burn some more books  all of the following things happen to Preston: he s given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be able to read his mind, he s impressed with the unrepentant sense offender he arrested Mary O Brien (Emily Watson), and he s letting some feelings into his hard interior as he takes pity on a stray puppy. This leads him to tell his big boss, Dupont (Angus MacFadyen), he wants to go after and permanently wipe out the underground movement (those that have stopped taking their drugs and are trying to save the items that have been banned). But Preston has become converted to the rebel s side by the feelings seeping through him, and he now aims to kill his society s leader Father (another way of saying Big Brother) with the help of the underground workers, and therefore hopes by contacting the rebels it will lead to a revolution.

11,DRN_Doc2_EQUILIBRIUM,"Equilibrium doesn't so much invoke a feeling of excitement as it does deja vu. Like George Orwell's 1984, the events take place in a bleak future where emotion is forbidden, and all those who exhibit it are arrested and exterminated. Like The Matrix, there's ""Gun Fu,"" (or Gun-Kata, if you prefer) the type of gun-play ballet that displays quick-cut carnage in slow-motion, opera-like exhilaration. Like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the totalitarian government sends out specially trained agents in search of valuable works of art to be destroyed in a ""baptism of fire."" Bits and pieces of many other genres and classic films offer much of the rest, from German expressionism to martial arts to Blade Runner's claustrophobic look around the city.

The events of Equilibrium take place in a post-apocalyptic world where the human race has been reduced to living in a land called Libria. The government that is instituted is a totalitarian one, under the iron thumb of someone called the ""Father,"" (Pertwee, Formula 51) who has outlawed any form of emotion in a way to prevent war and violence. Even artifacts that might inspire emotion, such as paintings and poetry, are forbidden to own or look at. The entire population is under sedation from a drug they must take to balance their emotions, and not doing so is also cause for removal from society.
John Preston (Bale, Reign of Fire) is a Clerick, a dangerous policeman with special powers in the form of martial arts training and an ability to sense emotions. He is the best at what he does, but finds himself curious as to what emotions are, and when he meets an attractive woman who is part of the rebellion, he is conflicted where his loyalties lie.

While all of these homages make the film interesting, unfortunately the presentation offers little new. The Matrix combined many genres into a unique new hybrid, but Equilibrium only regurgitates the lifted themes without anything new to add. The result is an uneven experience, because we like the themes presented, but they are conceived in such a simplistic way that the film has little credibility as a possible vision of what an actual future might be like. The fighting is exhilarating, yet somehow feels uneven when juxtaposed with the somber mood of the rest of the story.  Yet, without it Equilibrium might feel like a two-hour long ad for Calvin Klein's ""Obsession,"" starring Dieter from SNL's ""Sprockets.""
Equilibrium might be entertaining if you've never heard of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or any of the other films which might dip from the same thematic sci-fi pool for inspiration.  However, if you are on that level already, you'd be better off watching any of the film versions of either book, as they are far better than Equilibrium all-around.  It's a film so bland, that if the nation of Librium ever were to come into existence in the future, there would be no need to destroy any copies of this film.  It's hard to evoke any emotions watching drama this disinteresting.

12,DRN_Doc3_EQUILIBRIUM,"Equilibrium is a movie in search of a plot. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer (One Tough Bastard) came up with a fascinating concept: combining martial arts with gunplay. It's pretty derivative of  and any John Woo movie, with the main difference that it incorporates guns and firing into martial arts movements. With such a good idea, he apparently felt the need to make a science fiction movie, and not thinking of anything else, came up with a highly formulaic movie reminiscent of many other films that came before. Oddly enough, Equilibrium, although nearly completely brainless, is fairly enjoyable. Wimmer may not be the best writer, but he does have a keen eye for action and fight choreography.
The concept behind Equilibrium is that emotions are considered evil. The public takes daily injections of Prozium, a drug that suppresses any and all emotion, and the Grammaton Clerics, a police force, patrol looking for 'sense offenders,' people who go off Prozium. The Clerics are masters at the aforementioned art, which uses movements based on statistical probabilities. They move their bodies into the positions least likely to be in the line of fire, and fire where they are most likely to hit targets. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the best Cleric there is, and finds himself accidentally going off Prozium. He revels in these new emotions he is feeling, and finds himself torn between these emotions and his duties as a Cleric.
His new partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) suspects that something is amiss. The rest of Equilibrium is typical science fiction/oppressed society fare (think 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 mixed together). Preston slowly realizes what is truly happening, and goes in search of a rebel movement bent on toppling the government. Emily Watson of all people even makes an appearance. Equilibrium does get better, if not more familiar, as it progresses. Part of the reason is that Wimmer needs to spend time establishing his universe. Mostly it is because as Preston rebels further, he has more opportunity to kick butt.
Lately, Bale seems to be gravitating towards a more action-oriented role. Preston is a combination of his characters. Dressed to the nines, Preston coolly fires hundreds of rounds, managing to hit everybody all the while missing every bullet aimed at him. Watching him flip and jump is so graceful it is almost like ballet. The last 20 minutes or so of the film is almost one kinetic action sequence, full of guns, swords, and an exhilarating fist fight where both opponent are also trying to fire guns at each other. There is also something fun and completely unrealistic about watching a man completely incapacitate a circle of men around him pointing swords and/or guns at him. The camera work owes much to other action films, but Wimmer does a great job filming his sequences. Well, everything about Equilibrium owes much to other films. But in this brainless romp is an element of excitement, which makes it a little bit better than most of its fellow copycats.",DRN_Doc3_EQUILIBRIUM,DRN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium

Patrick - Negative

Equilibrium attempts to say something profound about human nature but winds up being just another derivative dystopian future flick that combines ideas borrowed from twentieth century literary classics (think Fahrenheit 451, Nineteen Eighty-Four, and Brave New World) with action fight scenes copied from The Matrix movies. An opening voice-over narration sets the scene,  In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive a fourth; that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked. So we have created a new arm of the law: The Grammaton Cleric, whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man - his ability to feel. 
 
Christian Bale stars as John Preston, one such cleric. He enforces the law against sense offenders   anyone caught having an emotion   seeking them out and destroying their hidden stashes of art   all of which is considered contraband and outlawed. To not very subtly make this point, at the beginning of the movie there is a scene where John Preston finds and destroys the Mona Lisa. All the citizens of Libria are forced to take daily dosages of an emotion suppressing drug called Prozium. Their leader is a mysterious figure known simply as Father. He is never seen in public but appears only via large screens.
 
One day Preston's partner is caught reading (gasp) a book of poems by William Butler Yeats. Preston is shocked to discover that his partner was not only a sense offender but that he had ties to the underground rebel movement, which turns out to be -literally- right under the ground where they are standing. Will John Preston realize the error of his ways, begin to feel, and join the rebels? Hmm, I wonder? And will he at some point find an old Victrola and a phonograph record of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, listen to it and burst into tears? Maybe.
 
While this is a somewhat intriguing idea it doesn't translate easily to the screen. Think about it, you have a movie where the majority of the characters are supposed to be incapable of experiencing a genuine emotion. A complete lack of feeling is a difficult thing to act and quite dull to watch. Christian Bale does a decent job but Taye Diggs seems to be constantly smirking.
 
Emily Watson is the female lead. She plays a sense offender named Mary who's apprehended by John Preston. Together they have the best dialogue in the movie...
 
Mary:  Why are you alive? 
 
John Preston:  I'm alive... I live... to safeguard the continuity of this great society. To serve
Libria. 
 
Mary:  It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point? 
 
John Preston:  What's the point of your existence? 
 
Mary:  To feel. 'Cause you've never done it, you can never know it. But it's as vital as breath. And without it, without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock... ticking. 
 
The Matrix style action sequences involve a new form of martial arts that combines karate with weaponry. It's called the gun katas and it enables someone to somehow miraculously dodge bullets at close range simply by learning the statistics of the different likely angles. It is never satisfactorily explained and is one of the sillier aspects of a movie that constantly walks the line between fantasy and ludicrousness.
 
The cinematography is nice and the sets are quite effective. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer (an American of German descent) shot many scenes at locations in Berlin, like Olympic Stadium, Deutschlandhalle, and the Brandenburg Gate in order to give the movie the right combination of  fascist  and  modern  architecture. The scenes set in the exterior of the city, where many of the rebels hide, were shot in partially dilapidated neighborhoods in East Berlin.
 
Equilibrium has its moments but overall it's a rehash of ideas put to better use elsewhere.",DRN_Doc4_EQUILIBRIUM,DRN,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium
14,DRN_Doc5_EQUILIBRIUM,"I tried watching Equilibrium a few years ago, but could not get past the first ridiculous action scene. Armed rebels have the high ground but are pathetically inept against the police. Bale kicks in a door, slides on it like a surfboard and then pauses dramatically in a pitch black room before opening fire and killing everyone in the room without mussing his hair. Seeing that Patrick reviewed it, I gave it a second look, unfortunately.
The real problem I have with this film is that the very premise itself is vastly flawed. As Patrick wrote, this dystopian future is a place where the population is controlled by an oppressive government that attempts to squash human emotion with a drug called Prozium. Art, literature and anything else that may cause an emotional reaction is illegal. This makes for a dark view of the future but not a very realistic one.
As my brother Scott once wrote about Star Trek, good Science Fiction stories are metaphors for actual social issues. Therein lies this movies biggest problem. If a government wants to control its population, it does not do it by trying to stamp out their emotions. Feelings are too innate to the human experience to deny. If you want to control the populace, you take advantage of their emotions.
In the days following 9/11, the United States was in such a patriotic fervor that George W. Bush could have gotten away with any military action he wanted. Note, the Patriot Act was passed during that time. The environmental movement does not sell its theories so much on fact as it does on emotional response. I cannot count how many people have argued man made global warming to me on an emotional level. ""What land will be left for our children if we allow drilling in Anwar?"" ""Look how sad that polar bear seems on that ice floe."" All Barack Obama has to do to justify huge spending is to say it is for ""Green"" jobs or energy and all the believers feel better about it. My own small town gets us to vote for a tax raise by threatening to cut our police force if we don't. Fear is a powerful motivator.
No, controlling emotions is pointless and impossible. Exploiting them is where the real power comes from. You make everyone think they are making their own decision, when in fact they are simply going down the path they have been led to. It is a seemingly win win arrangement.
Diggs does indeed smirk his way through the film, which is a contradictory way to play an emotionless person. When he arrests Preston, he clearly smiles down on him and then gets very angry with him in public. Do these guys show emotions or not? Either way, it does not matter. This film steals 1984's twist ending and left me wishing I had read the book again instead of watching this.
Patrick compared the fight scenes to The Matrix and rightly so. This is made all the more similar by the familiar dark clothing worn by the leads. He wrote that the action sequences involve a new form of martial arts that combines karate with weaponry. That may have been the intention, but all I saw was lots of posing. The soundtrack should have featured Madonna's song ""Vogue"" every time Bale gets into a fight. At least then this film would have been good for a laugh.

15,DRN_Doc6_EQUILIBRIUM,"What happens when The Matrix and Fahrenheit 451 get drunk and careless at a party? You probably end up with something like Equilibrium. This film, pulled from distribution at the last conceivable minute and hardly seen by anyone anywhere, cannot be recommended highly enough. In the tradition of such Dark Horse hits as Boondock Saints and Office Space, Equilibrium goes out of its way to prove that just because a movie might not clean up (Or even appear) at the box office doesn t mean it won t surprise people with how well it sells once the DVD s hit the shelves.
Equilibrium did not come out in a theater near me. I did not hear anything about it for months. Then, all of a sudden, the internet exploded with reviews; reviews which either franticly praised, or viciously condemned the film. This was my cue to go out and track a copy down. I decided to rent it and watch it with my girlfriend. I made one mistake; I watched it right after I saw The Matrix: Reloaded for the first time. I was not expecting too much from the film, I just wanted to be entertained for a few hours. Honestly I was going to get it out of the way so I could say  So that s what all the fuss was about  (Because I say things like that all the time).
I was surprised! I was shocked! I forgot about the $13 late fee my parents racked up on our Blockbuster account and left for me to pay!  I immediately made it my business to find a copy of my own. I very nearly paid the $30 they tried to charge me at both Suncoast and Barnes & Noble. That is a testament to this movies  greatness. Normally I would balk at paying $30, even for two movies, but Equilibrium was too good for me not to be able to watch it whenever I wanted. I lucked out and snagged a used copy for 15 bucks. Let s be honest; 30 dollars is just too damn much for a DVD with virtually no special features.
But enough about my quest to own the film, I need to tell you about watching it. I mentioned that I had expected little from this movie. I also said I was pleasantly surprised. Pleasantly surprised is an understatement. I was as  pleasantly surprised  as someone who wins $50,000 and a boat because his neighbor filled out a raffle ticket in his name and forgot to tell him.
The best way to do it (if you still have a chance (most people won t)) is to do things in this precise order;
1) See The Matrix for the first time
2) See Equilibrium for the first time
3) See The Matrix: Reloaded for the first time
Now, many people, having seen the second Matrix movie don t have this luxury. If you have been in a coma or in prison for the past 6 months, you can still see Equilibrium before the brilliant sequel to The Matrix. Equilibrium will change your life the way the  Matrix  movies did. That assumes you liked those movies. If not, rent Final Destination 2. You d be much better off watching a movie on Carson Daly s recommendation.
I realize that I have been anything but subtle in my comparing Equilibrium and The Matrix. This is deliberate. If Ray Bradbury had tried to copy The Matrix he would have written something very similar to Equilibrium. They both contain all the essential elements demanded by their target audience (horny teenage males). These essential elements include guns, 'splosions and boobies. I don t make the rules; I just shell out $10 for X2 so I can see Famke Janssen in a form-fitting body suit.
Christian Bale plays John Preston, a special unit of law enforcement referred to as a  Gramaton Cleric . It is the duty of the Clerics to dispose of  Sense offenders ; anyone who has stopped taking their special, feeling-suppressing medication called  Prozium . Every citizen of  Libria  is required to take their Prozium on a regular interval to keep them from feeling anything because those in power believe that in this way they can stamp out war and hate crime forever.
 The job of the Gramaton Cleric is simple: find and detain sense offenders, kill sense offenders who resist arrest, and destroy anything that has been declared  EC-10  and might trigger emotion. EC apparently stands for  Emotional Content . Everything is EC-10 for the most part.  In an early scene, Preston stumbles upon a cache of paintings, including the Mona Lisa. In a scene heavily reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451, he gives the command  Burn it.  The most famous painting in all the world and countless others are evaporated by industrial flame throwers as Preston turns his back and walks away.
I didn t love this movie so much because of the plot. I love the work of Ray Bradbury and other similar science fiction writers, but the plot is not by far the best part of this film. The action scenes steal the thunder from the plot-heavy dialogue scenes. The clerics are taught  Gun Kata s , wherein they memorize a series of predetermined movements wielding their guns much like a student of karate might wield sai s. The back story is that thousands of gun battles were studied, and the probabilities of the locations of antagonists and vectors of probable return fire were determined. In plain English, they figured out where you should stand if you don t want to get shot. A series of predetermined arm movements point the guns at the probable locations of antagonists; all that is left for the cleric to do is pull the trigger. The body moves very little, and the head does not move at all; the movement is all in the arms. These techniques are so effective that Preston dispatches about 10 armed suspects in a pitch-black room and receives no return fire.
Each action scene showcases a different aspect of the training a cleric receives; there are sword fights, gun fights, even a gun/sword fight. The guns are used almost as daggers; parrying an opponents  gun with your own so you avoid taking a bullet. Guns are taken away and used against their owners and even as bludgeons. Nearly every conceivable use of a gun is explored in the unique and original action scenes which pepper this film. Occasionally a gun is used to shoot someone as well. The action does not get boring because each scene is different and has its own unique quirks.
Have we learned nothing from The Matrix? I think everyone everywhere would agree; stuff looks cooler when you slow it way down. This technique was not used nearly enough in Equilibrium. Very few times was the action slowed down so that the viewer might catch everything, and have time to say to his friends  Did you SEE that?  Most of the time in this film, the answer would be  No.  The rewind button comes in handy while watching Equilibrium. I rewound quite a few times to clarify what had happened in the action scenes. Plus, a lot of the things that happen are worth seeing again (Or maybe it is just me; I watched the 4 seconds of Goodfellas where Joe Pesci is killed about 100 times before someone took the remote control away from me. Caffeine was involved.)  It would have definitely added to the film if more of the breath-taking action sequences had been slowed down so that they could be savored. The scenes were not as hard to follow as those in say, Daredevil (Whose genius idea was it to illuminate every fight scene in that movie with a strobe light?), but they could definitely have benefited from some slow-motion photography.
The acting in the film was phenomenal. First of all, Sean Bean can do absolutely no wrong by me. I have seen him in a handful of movies (Goldeneye, Ronin, Lord of the Rings, and Equilibrium) and I have learned two things about this actor.
1) His character will probably not be in the second half of the movie
2) He will turn in an excellent performance
He is probably one of the most underrated actors in recent memory. He gets my vote for the  Phillip Seymour Hoffman award for actors who will most likely never get the lead role in a movie anywhere other than Sundance.  Yet he always entertains, and was an excellent choice to play Errol Partridge in Equilibrium. It was either him or Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
Then you have Christian Bale. What can I say about him without sounding like a stalker? I d better leave it at that. Christian is a very consistent actor, and he keeps a straight face in moments in the film where he is required to and most others would not have been able to. Lots of critics really bashed his performance in this movie, but they said the same thing about Ron Livingston in Office Space and his career took off after that film. I guess the best thing we can say about Christian Bale in this film is that he does about what you would expect from Christian Bale. He is the quiet guy who starts yelling at the end of his movies. Rent Swing Kids.
The rest of the cast does a great job as well. If someone had turned in a sub-par performance, I would let you know. No one did. Emily Watson has a kind of eerie charm that lends her a sort of strange attractiveness beyond physical beauty. Taye Diggs is .American. Thank God they put at least one American in this movie. Angus MacFayden is . angry. But he usually is. Good old passive/aggressive Angus.
This movie is not, however, without shortcomings. It is not going to be a candidate for a golden globe or an academy award. But damn, it s entertaining! I loved it, so who cares if the critics didn t? Gun fights and a decent plot. The plot is not an excuse for the violence, nor is it a means of ferrying the character from one fight scene to the next. It is the biggest part of the film, and draws elements from many of the great science fiction novels of the 20th century. There are some plot holes. I can t list them without giving major plot events or the outcome of the film away. If you find some, remind yourself that it is just a movie. There aren t continuity errors by any means. All in all, it was a superb film, and I have thoroughly enjoyed multiple screenings in a week s period. It is a movie one can watch again and again. Unless you hate it, in which case you can return it to the video store and drink strong coffee to wash the taste out of your mouth. It isn t for everyone, but one the other hand, it isn t another Zombie vs. Ninja, and that has to count for something.

1) His character will probably not be in the second half of the movie
2) He will turn in an excellent performance
He is probably one of the most underrated actors in recent memory. He gets my vote for the  Phillip Seymour Hoffman award for actors who will most likely never get the lead role in a movie anywhere other than Sundance.  Yet he always entertains, and was an excellent choice to play Errol Partridge in Equilibrium. It was either him or Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
Then you have Christian Bale. What can I say about him without sounding like a stalker? I d better leave it at that. Christian is a very consistent actor, and he keeps a straight face in moments in the film where he is required to and most others would not have been able to. Lots of critics really bashed his performance in this movie, but they said the same thing about Ron Livingston in Office Space and his career took off after that film. I guess the best thing we can say about Christian Bale in this film is that he does about what you would expect from Christian Bale. He is the quiet guy who starts yelling at the end of his movies. Rent Swing Kids.
The rest of the cast does a great job as well. If someone had turned in a sub-par performance, I would let you know. No one did. Emily Watson has a kind of eerie charm that lends her a sort of strange attractiveness beyond physical beauty. Taye Diggs is .American. Thank God they put at least one American in this movie. Angus MacFayden is . angry. But he usually is. Good old passive/aggressive Angus.
This movie is not, however, without shortcomings. It is not going to be a candidate for a golden globe or an academy award. But damn, it s entertaining! I loved it, so who cares if the critics didn t? Gun fights and a decent plot. The plot is not an excuse for the violence, nor is it a means of ferrying the character from one fight scene to the next. It is the biggest part of the film, and draws elements from many of the great science fiction novels of the 20th century. There are some plot holes. I can t list them without giving major plot events or the outcome of the film away. If you find some, remind yourself that it is just a movie. There aren t continuity errors by any means. All in all, it was a superb film, and I have thoroughly enjoyed multiple screenings in a week s period. It is a movie one can watch again and again. Unless you hate it, in which case you can return it to the video store and drink strong coffee to wash the taste out of your mouth. It isn t for everyone, but one the other hand, it isn t another Zombie vs. Ninja, and that has to count for something.

Benjamin Franklin once said, ""Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither."" Such is the world of Equilibrium. Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer's (Ultraviolet) physical vision of a future world where the essence of humanity has been sacrificed for the sake of the physical welfare of humanity is a little stale -- and necessarily so -- but in a film like this, it's the theme rather than the look that counts. Equilibrium is a modern masterpiece that examines the folly of overzealous governmental/tyrannical control over a population, in this case taken to the extreme: removing the very essence of mankind for the sake of saving mankind in the physical sense, but at the price of his emotional and spiritual welfare. Indeed, in the world of Equilibrium it's the very things that make men free -- individuality, choice, association, emotion, ownership, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- that have been outlawed for the ""betterment"" of man, and while this new, sterile, inconsequential way of life may lead to physical safety, it's far more damaging to man than bullets or bombs. This is a no-nonsense look at the dangers of forsaking liberty for security as told in the shape of an Action/Science Fiction film. Equilibrium pulls no punches and leaves its message front-and-center in every frame, though never to the detriment of the whole.

In the not-too-distant future, war has ravaged the planet at the price of countless lives. Mankind cannot survive a fourth World War. To avoid further conflict, a totalitarian regime has risen to power and outlawed any and all things -- both physical objects and beliefs alike -- that could influence human emotion, potentially lead to disagreement, and shatter the forced state of harmony that exists following the war. Not only is art, music, poetry, and even fancy mirror borders outlawed, but man is controlled through the injection of a suppressive drug meant to ensure submission to the new way of life. The government routinely raids known strongholds of resistance where emotions remain; the drugs unused; and art, poetry, and music are present and provide emotional stimuli. Armed soldiers patrol the streets, but highly-skilled killers known as ""Clerics"" work hand-in-hand with the police force to deter and defeat the enemy of emotion and the rebels who harbor it. Amongst the Clerics is John Preston (Christian Bale, Terminator Salvation), an elite killing machine who is hailed as the best of the best amongst his peers and an unflappable protector of the regime's doctrine. He even kills his partner (Sean Bean, Flightplan) for perusing a confiscated poetry book. When Preston accidentally misses his morning dose of the emotion-stifling drug, he begins to experience emotions -- concern, regret, despair, uncertainty -- that threaten his job and his life. His new partner Brandt (Taye Diggs, Go) notices the changes and suspects Preston of harboring emotions. When Preston finally awakens to a moment of catharsis, he goes on the offensive with the purpose of eliminating the totalitarian regime that has in essence destroyed mankind for the sake of saving it.

Equilibrium may be a damning look at forcible control and the dangers of sacrificing freedom for safety, but it exists in the superficial guise of an Action movie. Certainly the themes are plainly obvious but the picture is structurally a basic run-and-gun/martial arts hybrid sort of affair that demonstrates great artistic proficiency in showcasing the various skills of the ""Clerics"" who shoot like RoboCop and sword fight like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It's hard to fathom such skill in an emotionless world, how people of such natural gifts could be selected for the job when human emotions such as pride are outlawed and flaunting demonstrations of athletic skill would be, at best, frowned upon. There are certainly other liberties taken in the film, such as the remaining institution of marriage which would seem to have no bearing in a world governed through the absence of emotion, for what is marriage but an open proclamation of the greatest emotion of them all? Perhaps it's a means through which those in charge can guarantee themselves future ""subjects"" over whom to rule, but that would suggest some sense of personal satisfaction -- hubris, maybe -- at the holding of personal power and authority over others. Certainly the powers-that-be would not themselves eschew the lifestyle they force upon their subjects...would they? Regardless of a few plot holes, Equilibrium works because of its adherence to principals and a willingness to tell a daring, damning story that often feels all-too-real or, at the very least, all-too-plausibly-real in a real world where strife is common and ever-shrinking liberties are shrugged off as the necessary price to pay for safety and ""happiness"" by those with the loudest voice and in the highest positions of power and influence.

No matter its relative merits as an Action film or the negatives of a few question marks; the pulse of Equilibrium beats most strongly in the story. It's certainly not allegorical -- there are no allusions here, everything is front-and-center -- but it is instead made obvious so as to more succinctly make its point. That's not to the film's detriment; while allegory is often used to strong, tone-establishing, purpose-revealing commentary, Equilibrium's matter-of-fact tone resonates just as strongly and achieves the same kind of success even if the point isn't made in a more shadowy, undercover sense that's defined many of the great cautionary tales of yore. The film makes a point to emphasize the crime of individuality and the norm of conformity, the perceived dangers of emotion, and the perceived stability of the lack thereof. Though the special effects don't hold up well and the sets are (deliberately) stale and sterile, Equilibrium masterfully creates a mood which necessarily supersedes all else. The film's picture of an obviously totalitarian regime controlling a de facto slave race (to what end is never exactly revealed, though it's certainly implied) that has willingly sacrificed its very essence for the guarantee of security is vividly, if not sometimes too obviously, drawn, but then again the film focuses on a society built on extremes, which implies, if not demands, simplicity and the obvious above all else. The message would certainly be too heavy-handed -- though no less relevant -- without its dazzling action pieces offsetting the somber tone, but Equilibrium absolutely thrives as an achievement of film that engenders critical thinking and that speaks loudly and clearly on the dangers of the slippery slope that is the sacrifice of freedom for some idealistic but foolhardy goal that simply cannot be achieved at the business end of a gun, through the swallowing of a pill, and by the removal of any and all emotion and individuality. The human spirit is too strong.

Equilibrium's 1080p, 1.78:1-framed transfer is one of those that looks good at-a-glance, but a more critical analysis reveals plenty of problems. First and foremost, the image is presented in an ""HDTV full frame"" 1.78:1 aspect ratio rather than its wider 2.35:1-or-thereabouts theatrical presentation. While the film is said to have been shot in Super35, the blow-up from its theatrical exhibition aspect ratio, presumably for the sake of eliminating ""black bars"" from the equation, is unacceptable, even if there's little information actually lost along the way. That said, Equilibrium doesn't look bad in places. Fine detail can be quite good; skin textures are often quite revealing, while clothing and even close-ups of firearms reveal crisp, accurate details. Colors are limited to cold, steely, lifeless shades for the most part; Equilibrium is by design cold and gray, but what few splashes of color exist beyond white and gray and black appear neutral and accurate. Black levels are decent, never looking washed out and exhibiting only slight, if any, crush. Flesh tones are often a bit pale, which seems in-line with the film's intended look. So far, so good, but Equilibrium features an over-sharpened appearance and is absolutely slathered in edge enhancement, some of the heaviest that one is ever likely to see on a Blu-ray disc. Additionally, it appears that at least some noise reduction has been applied, but only sporadically so; grain is present in some scenes, wiped away in others. Banding and blocking are of only minor concern. Remove the excess edge enhancement and display the film in its proper aspect ratio and this would be a quality transfer, but alas, it just wasn't meant to be this go-round.

Unfortunately, Equilibrium hasn't received the sonic treatment the film not only deserves, but demands. The included DTS-HD MA 2.0 lossless soundtrack just doesn't cut it. Though it tries and struggles and does all it can, the sonic presentation is decidedly lacking. The front-heavy feel does a disservice to the film's many action scenes, where it sounds like half the soundstage has simply been chopped off. Action effects are cramped, and with the back channels effectively dead, the confined sensation puts forth a sour note. Where there should be fuller, more lively action elements, there's nothing. Sure, gunfire zips across the front half of the soundstage with a good deal of energy and even creates a few front-end directional effects, but that it just seems to stop dead in its tracks is jarring to say the least. This track does squeeze out a decent low end, but clarity is a real problem area in most every area save dialogue. Dialogue occasionally seems to bleed over to the side for no apparent reason, but such instances are the exception rather than the rule, the spoken word generally firmly entrenched in the center speaker and playing with suitable stability and clarity. Of all of the recent wave of 2.0 rather than 5.1 soundtracks, this might be the most adversely-effected film. A lossy 5.1 mix would have been preferable to a two-channel lossless offering in this instance, never mind a full-fledged 5.1 lossless soundtrack.

Equilibrium's Blu-ray release actually contains one extra, a featurette entitled Finding 'Equlibrium' (480p, 4:26). It's a disappointingly brief and by-the-numbers rapid-fire making-of piece that features cast and crew talking up the movie, intercut with clips form the film and behind-the-scenes footage.

Equilibrium rings true, or rings with a potential to be true, with every viewing. In it, people are sheep and the human condition has all but been eradicated under the false premise of safety and security. Of course, it's all about the price one must pay for such things, and in Equilibrium, that's the soul, at least figuratively speaking. This is an engaging and wonderfully thought-provoking picture that explores the value of human life in the physical sense versus the spiritual and emotional senses. There's so much talk about ""safety"" and ""security"" both in the film and in real life that one must decide what the true price of liberty must be and on what is placed a higher value: the body or the soul. Is life truly worth living - - and may it even be called living -- if man forcibly devolves into mindless, drug-controlled robots who serve no purpose either in their own lives or for the greater good of society? Equilibrium posits such questions while in the guise of an Action picture, but make no mistake, this is much more than that. Unfortunately, Echo Bridge's Blu-ray release of this important and cult-favorite film features a subpar technical presentation and only one extra. Viewers must choose how much they will sacrifice to own a neutered copy of the film. Quite the parallel to the picture's themes, no? Oh the irony.

17,DRN_Doc8_EQUILIBRIUM,"Bale Bales on the Future
On one hand ""Equilibrium"" bores me; I'm bored of movies which feature a dystopian future where a government is making everyone's life a misery. But then on the other hand this future world where feeling is repressed by daily drugs is quite clever and features action which can only be described as Matrix-esque in style which makes it surprisingly entertaining. It even manages to draw you in to the story of Feeling Officer John Preston and you wonder what will happen in the end, as in will he save certain people, be discovered and so on serving up twists which don't let you down. As such ""Equilibrium"" does a reasonable job of entertaining with its idea of a future where feelings are outlawed and an elite force destroy those who chose to have feelings and own such contraband items which cause feelings.
Following a Third World War it is decided that the emotions are the cause of war and in order to eliminate war the freedom to feel must be suppressed with those renegades who chose not to comply and have contraband goods such as books and records being exterminated. Grammaton Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale - Captain Corelli's Mandolin) is one of the top enforcement officers whose job it is to destroy all contraband and those who refuse to take a daily injection to suppress their emotions. But when he accidentally misses a dose he finds himself discovering a new and confusing world where he has emotions but somehow has to hide this fact from those who would kill him if they knew.

So as already mentioned ""Equilibrium"" is another one of those movies which paint a grim picture of the future, a future where following a third world war the freedom to have feelings is outlawed as those who rule decide feelings are behind mankinds self destruction. Now I'm just a little bored of these movies which paint a dystopian future for the simple reason that they always seem to be a government who have messed up society by their dictatorial rule. Yes the symbolism in ""Equilibrium"" which obvious mirrors that of Hitler and the Nazi's is semi clever but on one level it is just another futuristic movie where we have misery thanks to the government and a bunch of renegades fighting oppression.
But get beyond this and there is some intelligence to ""Equilibrium"" especially that the oppression comes from suppressing feelings as it is seen as the cause of conflict and mankind's destruction. And as we watch John Preston initially forget to take his daily drug and experience emotion for the first time it does become interesting. It delivers some interesting scenarios where he tries to keep up the masquerade of being emotionless as he goes about his job yet battles to hide the feelings which are so alien to him. You just have to smile when it is the discovery of a dog which almost blows his cover, as he can't bear to see it exterminated.
What also helps ""Equilibrium"" is that it twists and turns and whilst it sets up the cliche element of John being the saviour of the renegades as he is the only one who can stop the Father's dictatorial rule it also throws up some surprises. It's because of these surprises, these twists which end up lifting ""Equilibrium"" into becoming something genuinely exciting and more that just will he or won't he help the renegades regain control.
Now in lesser hands ""Equilibrium"" could have been quite dull but writer and director Kurt Wimmer brings a touch of the ""Matrix"" to it. Not in the sense that not is all that it seems but when it comes to the action it has that same snappy, punchy feel to it. Scenes which see John take down both renegades and officers with some fancy moves and a lot of gun action may feel a bit like an imitation but they are exciting. And Wimmer embellishes the action nicely, advancing the style which we witnessed in ""The Matrix"" so it adds something new to it, something as simple as the way John's guns reload during battle. But it is not all about the action and Wimmer uses the snappy action to punctuate the drama of the story rather than it just being what bad ass move John will do next.
That ""Matrix"" styling also comes to the actual look of the future and in particular the slick hair and long coat of Christian Bale as John Preston. But what is interesting is the harshness of this look softens in tune with when he starts to feel emotions again. Aside from this Christian Bale does a solid job of making John interesting, allowing us to understand the confusion and fear he feels when for the first time he feels emotion. It's not the deepest of characters but it works especially when it comes to the action scenes. And to be honest whilst ""Equilibrium"" also features Sean Bean, Emily Watson, Taye Diggs and Angus MacFadyen it is Bale who really drives this movie forwards, with maybe the exception of young Matthew Harbour who is terrific and quite scary as John's emotionless son.
What this all boils down to is that as Dystopian movies go ""Equilibrium"" isn't that bad. Behind the obviousness of a miserable future where renegades try to over throw a dictatorial government there is some cleverness and whilst it is obvious that John Preston will be some form of saviour characters there are plenty of twists before we even get close to that outcome. It is very Matrix-esque in style and the action is one of the highlights of the movie but it does have the solid storyline to back it up and stop it just from becoming another futuristic action movie.

Robert Barbere

In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive a fourth; that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked. So we have created a new arm of the law: The Grammaton Cleric, whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man - his ability to feel.

when it comes to rebellion in a dystopian society, there has to be giant screens with the dictator's face pontificating pablum for the proletariat masses. That is the world of ""Equilibrium"" and the land of Libria. After a third world war, the survivors of Librium decided that it is the unchecked emotions that humans fall prey to that are the root cause of violence and war. Taking a hint form the Stoics of Ancient Greece, the Librians have outlawed emotions declaring it Sense Crime. Unlike the Vulcans of the ""Star Trek"" universe who replaced emotions with logic, the people of Libria medicate themselves daily with a drug called Prozium, an emotion stabilizer that keeps the population in check. In this seemingly sterilized world of modern, tall, fascist looking buildings, armed guards stand on the sidelines in their black visor helmets constantly vigilant for any form of Sense Crime. Even the young children participate in the witch-hunt. In charge of much of this are the Grammaton Clerics, a quasi-religious - arm of the law who lead the charge against emotion. Writer and director Kurt Wimmer (""The Thomas Crown Affair"") provides the audience with a social message buried in the spectacular Gun Kata fights. Christian Bales stars as a conflicted cleric who like all protagonists in any dystopian rebellion must overcome his own feelings or in this case lack of them to bring down The System. Due to the amount of violence, the MPAA rates ""Equilibrium"" R and the film runs about an hour and forty-seven minutes.
The great nepenthe. Opiate of our masses. Glue of our great society. Salve and salvation, it has delivered us from pathos, from sorrow, the deepest chasms of melancholy and hate. With it, we anesthetize grief, annihilate jealousy, obliterate rage. Those sister impulses towards joy, love, and elation are anesthetized in stride, we accept as fair sacrifice. For we embrace Prozium in its unifying fullness and all that it has done to make us great. ~ Father

Although ""Equilibrium"" is derivative in many ways, drawing from the works of Orwell, Huxley, and Bradbury, writer and director Kurt Wimmer packages the concepts of freedom of thought nicely into a film that doesn't dwell too deeply in the philosophy, but utilizes action elements that will appeal to the adrenaline or the video game junkies. Christian Bale is Cleric John Preston. Dressed in black with a high collar, he and his partner Errol Partridge (Sean Bean - ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"") enter a building outside the city in the Nether that was identified as a resistance stronghold for The Underground. Along with squads of police, some in riot gear, they come to a room where the offenders plan to make their last stand. In ""Matrix"" fashion, with monastic vocalizing in the background, Preston runs toward the door, knocking it down, in the dark, he begins a gunfight that seems impossible to win. The strobe like glimpses of gunfire as Preston performs a ballet in the dark with twin fully automatic Beretta 92FS. When the lights go on, all are dead except for Preston. His partner and the rest of the squad enter and after a brief inspection, Preston orders that the police hack through the floorboards. Underneath are rare classical paintings including Leonardo DaVinci's ""Mona Lisa."" Like the fireman in ""Fahrenheit 451,"" Preston calmly orders all the pictures burned. 
Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams. ~ William Butler Yeats

Preston's career so far is stunning, his intuition of what people are thinking, and his faith in the Tetragrammaton Council seems unshakeable, until today. Returning to the city with his partner, both sitting in the backseat, Preston notices a poetry book in Partridges coat pocket. When Preston asks him about it, Partridge s answer raises a red flag in Preston's mind. In totalitarian societies that we, as viewers, have come to know, suspicion is a virtue. The government encourages children to denounce their parents and friends to turn on friends. In a supposedly emotionless society, this betrayal is just par for the course. In Orwell's ""1984,"" he surrounds us of images of Big Brother, but here in Libria, Father played by Sean Pertwee (""Event Horizon,"" ""Dog Soldiers"") doesn't have much of a role in this film, but his voice and his image is everywhere dictating the benefits of Prozium to a blank staring society. Similar to ""1984,"" a poem voices the central theme of the film. Preston, led by his suspicions, finds Partridge in a crumbling cathedral the Nethers, sitting and reading William Butler Yeats' ""He wishes for the cloths of heaven."" Preston shoots Partridge in the head. Here, the poem instills the theme of ""Equilibrium"" in both Preston's mind and the viewers. Wimmer doesn't want to make a political statement, but instead the message is more spiritual or philosophical that strikes out against unity and conformity.

After Preston accidentally loses, one of his doses of Prozium, his 12-year-old son, with a deadpan look and monotone voice commands his father to, ""Log the loss, and get a refill."" The boy is cold and menacing, as he asks his father about seeing a boy cry, ""should I report him?"" Preston who hasn't refilled his dose and his emotions are beginning to kick in, almost faltering, ""yes, of course you should.  We all know emotions are a powerful thing, and it is a measure of a man who can control his emotions. Preston's new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs - ""Go""), is a Cleric whose ambition is set for the top, and being at the top means deposing Preston. During a raid within Libria, Preston and Brandt come across another member of the Underground, a Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson - ""Red Dragon""). Arrested for Sense Crime, they take Mary away. After having a wall torn away, Preston finds objects that come from a time before the war, a time when people could still feel, still have emotion. As emotions begin to take control, Preston is caught rearranging his desk, making it different from the others. He is almost caught by Brandt. While cleaning up on another raid, where Preston was almost caught letting some offenders go, he finds himself in a room filled with more artifacts. The room, like V's room from ""V is for Vendetta,"" the room is filled with art, literature and music. Preston accidently starts up an old Victrola with Beethoven's  Ninth Symphony, First Movement.  Preston is wracked with emotion; memories of his wife, incinerated for Sense Crime come flooding back. The assumption here is that marriage and breeding are purely biological acts and have no emotional encumbrances. 

Through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights, the Cleric has determined that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically predictable element. The gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon, each fluid position representing a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents while keeping the defender clear of the statistically traditional trajectories of return fire. By the rote mastery of this art, your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120%. The difference of a 63% increase to lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly.   Vice Councilor Dupont

With music, art, and literature outlawed, the council has divested society of most of its attachments leaving only rote adherence to the Tetragrammaton Council. Here, the Tetragram is a quasi-religious symbol representing the theonym for the four letters that represent the name of God in Hebrew. The T symbol is all present in Libria, representing the lower half of the cross, giving a subconscious under tone of religion throughout the film. The cleric is part priest and part warrior. Like the Shaolin priest who practices the martial art of Kung Fu (Wushu), the Clerics are masters in Gun Fu or better known in Libria as the Gun-Kata, A set of forms that optimize the number of victims during a gun battle. Preston is the master, but Brandt is close behind. Without Prozium, Preston questions his superiors, and while he finds their answers lacking, they find him losing faith in their cause. The battle between Brandt and Preston becomes one of cat and mouse as Preston attempts to contact the underground. Tricks within tricks, feints within feints, the viewer is left guessing if the resistance is real or not. Garth (William Fichtner - ""The Perfect Storm""), a friend of Partridge, leads The Underground as they blow up Prozium plants within the city. 

The ending of the film is spectacular in the sense of the thought that Wimmer put into the script and Bale's effort in both the acting department as well as in the action scenes. Much of the ending is ""Matrix"" like but better in ways that make the film worth watching. The cast is primarily British, including Bale, and includes Americans Taye Diggs and William Fichtner who all do an excellent job in building their characters and the world around them. Vice Councilor Dupont (Angus Macfadyen    Braveheart ) shares the title of antagonist with Brandt when it comes holding the people of Libria down in their controlled state. The film's composer, Klaus Badelt, brings a solid depth to the film, while Dion Beebe's cinematography depicts more of an alternative world rather than something futuristic or apocalyptic. Wimmer's choice to film in Berlin gives Libria a solid totalitarian look. Overall, ""Equilibrium"" succeeds where the ""Matrix"" fails in story, and it doesn t encumber the viewer with political rhetoric like ""1984.""

""Equilibrium'' would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun.
The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment. In a free society many, maybe most, audience members will hardly notice the message. But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous. You know who you are.
The movie is set in the 21st century--hey! that's our century!--at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His.
Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend.
Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feels--well, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id.
If ""Equilibrium"" has a plot borrowed from 1984, Brave New World and other dystopian novels, it has gunfights and martial arts borrowed from the latest advances in special effects. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that the form of battle used in the movie is ""Gun-Kata,"" which is ""a martial art completely based around guns."" I credit Nunziata because I think he may have invented this term. The fighters transcribe the usual arcs in mid-air and do impossible acrobatics, but mostly use guns instead of fists and feet. That would seem to be cheating, and involves a lot of extra work (it is much easier to shoot someone without doing a back-flip), but since the result is loud and violent it is no doubt worth it.
There is an opening sequence in which Preston and Partridge approach an apartment where Offenders are holed up, and Preston orders the lights to be turned out in the apartment. Then he enters in the dark. As nearly as I could tell, he is in the middle of the floor, surrounded by Offenders with guns. A violent gun battle breaks out, jerkily illuminated by flashes of the guns, and everyone is killed but Preston. There is nothing about this scene that even attempts to be plausible, confirming a suspicion I have long held, that the heroes of action movies are protected by secret hexes and cannot be killed by bullets.
There are a lot more similar battles, which are pure kinetic energy, made of light, noise and quick cutting. They seem to have been assembled for victims of Attention Deficit Syndrome, who are a large voting block at the box office these days. The dispassionate observer such as myself, refusing to Sense Offense my way through such scenes, can nevertheless admire them as a technical exercise.
What I like is the sneaky way Kurt Wimmer's movie advances its philosophy in between gun battles. It argues, if I am correct, that it is good to feel passion and lust, to love people and desire them, and to experience voluptuous pleasure through great works of music and art. In an early scene Cleric Preston blow-torches the 'Mona Lisa,' the one painting you can be pretty sure most moviegoers will recognize. But in no time he is feeling joy and love, and because he is the hero, this must be good, even though his replacement partner, Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs), suspects him, and wants to expose him.
The rebel group in ""Equilibrium"" preserves art and music (there is a touching scene where Preston listens to a jazz record), and we are reminded of Bradbury and Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" where book lovers committed banned volumes to memory. One is tempted to look benevolently upon ""Equilibrium"" and assume thought control can't happen here, but of course it can, which is why it is useful to have an action picture in which the Sense Offenders are the good guys.

100,JMI_Doc1_Fresh,"Is Sebastian Stan the dullest actor working today? I know were supposed to give Kevin Feige credit for meticulously planning a decade of cultural dominance on the back of a napkin, but I like to think hed have taken better care with casting The First Avenger back in 2011 if anyone had known how many major events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe would hinge on our affection for Captain Americas eighth-billed buddy. (The Winter Solider is such a sorry superhero he makes Hawkeye look cool.) Much like Hulus dreadful miniseries Pam and Tommy, in which Stan and Lily James play the generously endowed tabloid couple like a couple of your co-workers getting carried away and making everyone uncomfortable at the office Halloween party, director Mimi Caves Sundance midnight selection FRESH is another attempt to play against the actors blandly handsome, TV doctor looks.
The fetching Daisy Edgar-Jones stars as Noa, a struggling twentysomething singleton sick of swiping right on losers. The films best scene is its first, during which she endures a disastrous internet date with a cheapskate, casually insulting suitor (Brett Dier) that suggests were in for a sly comedy of manners about the era of Tinder hookups. But then on a trip to the grocery store she meets Stans Steve, a sheepish plastic surgeon who seems too good to be true. Their awkward, IRL encounter soon blooms into something more, even as Noas bisexual best friend (Jojo T. Gibbs) advises her that charming quirks like Steves absence from social media are actually more like red flags in this day and age, especially when he wants to take her away for a surprise weekend getaway to an undisclosed location.
The opening credits for Fresh dont drop until the 38-minute mark, and I guess Steves plans for Noa probably constitute a spoiler so I should shut up here. But lets just say that the scripts savvy understanding of contemporary romantic woes are far in the rearview by then. Theres no way a movie with a story like this should clock in at a full two hours, giving the audience entirely too much time to ponder annoying logistical questions better skimmed past. (How convenient that Noa is one of those movie characters who has no family and exactly one friend.)
Theres strained central metaphor in Lauryn Kahns screenplay about how women in relationships sometimes find themselves accommodating their lovers unsavory tastes so as not to rock the boat. But by then the movie has become so untethered from any psychological reality one is with nothing but the cool, TV-commercial colors from Hereditary and Midsommar cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski in one over-composed shot after another. Stans even boring while baring his fangs, and after the first big twist everything he does becomes a foregone conclusion faster than you can say, It puts the lotion in the basket.
Fresh feels more like an exercise than anything else  a calling card for an up-and-coming filmmaker thats one of those midnight movies for festival audiences to talk about over breakfast and then forget about before lunch.",JMI_Doc1_Fresh,JMI,Horror,Negative,Fresh
101,JMI_Doc2_Fresh,"The central idea of Fresh is either a blunt metaphor that gets in the way of the movie's actual point or the foundation of a sincere, creepy thriller that oversteps its significance. Either way, the movie comes across as a mishmash of tones, approaches, and purposes.
It starts with relative innocence, as we watch Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) try to look for a goodor, at least, not-entirely-terribleman in the world of online dating. Her most recent date is with a self-absorbed guy (played by Brett Dier) who's late for their dinner outing, isn't interested in a thing she has to say, displays more than a hint of racism while talking to the server, and, even though he made certain Noa knew they'd be splitting the bill, takes all of the leftovers for himself. The final notes of the evening have him suggesting they go out again, her saying they don't seem too compatible, and him responding with increasingly aggressive insults.
Yes, this is how things have been going for Noa, and there's an amusing but unpleasant honesty to how screenwriter Lauryn Kahn sums up the despair, harassment, and quiet fear of the modern-day dating scene for women in these introductory scenes. While Noa can receive some constant sympathy and support from her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), the young woman does want a romantic relationship.
Enter Steve (Sebastian Stan). They meet at a grocery store, and he's charming but awkward, handsome but funny, and assertive but with a seemingly genuine sense of embarrassment about asking for her phone number. Noa is intrigued, and then, she can't stop thinking about him. When he texts her to ask her out for drinks, Noa accepts.
There's barely a hint of what's to come in the scenes of grounded, whirlwind romance that follow. The two talk with some humor, self-awareness, and sincerity about their pasts and current lives, and Steve seems to be, not only a not-entirely-terrible guy, but also a good and kind and thoughtful one, who also happens to make good money as a reconstructive surgeon. Noa falls quickly and hard, and while Mollie's suspicions about someone who seems this too-good-to-be-true definitely strike us as a bit of foreshadowing, Noa doesn't seem to care.
She and Steve are going to take a trip together, although the destination is a surprise and, whoops, they'll have leave the next day after a stay at his house, which happens to be in the middle of the woods without any cellphone service. There it is.
All of that is simply a prologueand a seemingly unessential one, given how far removed any sense of normalcy is from the proceeding materialfor what's to come. To detail what follows the major twist of the plot and the story's intentions might undermine the surprise, but then again, it becomes clear that Kahn and director Mimi Cave are mostly out to continually shock us.
It all begins as a straightforward abduction thriller, in which Noa is imprisoned and must find a way to escape her captor. Matters, though, quickly become much darker and more discomforting when it's revealed that Noa's abductor wants her for her meat. She's not the first or, currently, the only one in this situation, either.
Structurally, all of this pretty standard. Noa connects with or plays mind games on her captor, and while it's fairly clear that the latter is happening, the movie's tone fluctuates so severely between terror (a couple scenes of non-consensual surgery and plenty of amputated human body parts being sliced, cooked, and eaten) and dark humor (peppy music to accompany the horrific images and no small number of cannibalism puns) that it undermines the potential suspense. Meanwhile, Mollie begins searching for her missing friend and uncovers a different part of what Steve has been hiding (A former lover, played by Dayo Okeniyi, of hers helpsbut only to a certain point, which makes another point about trusting any man). His normal life seems perfectly ordinary on the surface, and whatever that means about Ann (Charlotte Le Bon), his partner in that regular life who may or may not know about those secrets, is dismissed for a couple of not-too-surprising twists.
The abduction and cannibalism angles of this tale surely have some underlying meaning about how much men take from women (quite literally, in this scenario) and how much of that women are willing to accept (There's Ann, most obviously, but some other prisoners have come to accept their fate to some degree). Clearly, the filmmakers believe the shock and horror of the story's most extreme elements will emphasize the message of Fresh, but along with the movie's uncertain and shifting tone, they're mostly a distraction from the point.

102,JMI_Doc3_Fresh,"Modern dating is banal and dehumanizing. The most common way to do it is via app, where  in much the same way youd order chicken tenders for delivery  you pick from a bunch of options provided by an algorithm. You know that algorithm is likely to let you down, so you just hope it wont lead you to certain death. Its a boring, horrible way to think about people, at odds with the fundamental desire at the heart of dating: to be seen as a complete person by someone interested in you, and you in them. Whats more likely is objectification: Dating apps encourage users to reduce each other down to parts. To meat.
The indie horror movie Fresh takes that familiar metaphor to a particularly literal extreme. The debut film from director Mimi Cave and writer Lauryn Kahn follows Noa (Normal Peoples Daisy Edgar-Jones), a young woman in the throes of dating ennui, dating boring, ridiculous men who feel at liberty to comment on her appearance, want to ramble exclusively about their own interests, and then insult her when she isnt interested in a second date, much less first-date sex.
Steve (the Marvel Cinematic Universes Winter Soldier, Sebastian Stan) is different. Noa meets him in a grocery store  the first of the films many delicious ironies. Hes charming, clever, and not interested in pressuring her for sex. Even though she barely knows him, Noa decides to go on a weekend getaway with Steve after only a few blissful dates. This turns out to be a mistake when Steve drugs her and imprisons her, with the plan to keep her alive and slowly sell her body as meat to extremely wealthy clients who have developed a taste for cannibalism.
In spite of that horrific premise, theres a comedic mean streak to Fresh that keeps it from getting too grotesque or grim  starting with the films opening credits, which dont kick off until 30 minutes into the film, when Steve makes his move. Stan effortlessly pivots from charm to menace in that role, operating in a mode not that dissimilar from Penn Badgley as YOUs Joe Godlberg, albeit less sympathetic. Steve has been doing this to women for a long time. Hes a fully formed amoral monster, but a charming one who dances as he works and likes to banter with his victim. As Noas imprisonment continues, her captivity begins to take on the bizarre cadence of dating.
That dynamic is Fresh at its horrific best: In the moments of ambiguity, when Noa, in a desperate bid for survival, starts to believe Steve is taking his time with her because he likes her, and she encourages him to think she might like him too  even suggesting they should start having dinner together, even if that dinner involves human flesh. Cave juxtaposes these scenes against moments of banal consumption. Other characters having normal, non-cannibal meals are shot with unsettling closeness and deafening sound, emphasizing the rip and tear of consumption, the way one life is masticated into nothing but selfish fuel for another life. Late in the film, Noa and Steve engage in a hypnotic, dreamlike dance thats played more to the camera than to each other, a scene that could be read as interrogating the viewers own form of consumption  will we post a gif of it later? Strip it of its context and use it to fuel our own egos?
But theres a give-and-take in the clever cinematic sleights Cave employs in Freshs more entrancing moments. She tangles the horror and peril of dating gone wrong with the understanding that takes place when it goes right. When these two leads bleed together, they believe theyre seeing each other for the first time. Cave takes a light touch with the gore in this film, but she uses it to pointed affect.
Unfortunately, Fresh ditches that ambiguity in favor of an otherwise straightforward survival plot that suffers in its inability to examine its characters too closely. In spite of the films more artful moments, Steve remains an uncomplicated villain, and Noa a largely uncomplicated victim. Moments that give the impression that the film may become an uncomfortable, fascinating locked-room drama give way to basic thriller beats where Noa attempts to escape, as her best friend suspects something may be amiss. By the end of Fresh, the film hasnt done anything more than restating what it made clear at the start: Dating is hell, and women deserve more than to be treated like pieces of meat.

103,JMI_Doc4_Fresh,"There is a line in horror, where the storytelling can go from tense to traumatic and engrossing to grotesque, and filmmakers cross such a line at their own peril. Once done, it can be very difficult to get an audience back as its one thing to compel an audience to cover their eyes and another thing to force them to look away. Such is the case with the new horror film FRESH thats premiering on Hulu today, written by Lauryn Kahn and directed by Mimi Cave. It starts out as a deft examination of the angst of dating in the age of swiping left and right, and all too soon turns into a film that loses our sympathies as it turns nauseating.
Indeed, the point of FRESH is to sicken us at how men treat women, but it makes its case with a very heavy hand.  Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a young woman growing more and more frustrated with the creeps she encounters in the dating world. They may appear handsome and charming, but soon enough, most of the guys reveal themselves to be shallow, snide, and creepy. Thus, Noa retreats to the sympathetic ear of her bestie Millie (Jonica JoJo T. Gibbs) and they kvetch about how difficult it is to find a guy with the right stuff. 
Then, Noa happens upon Steve (Sebastian Stan) in a grocery store and her fortunes appear to change. Hes handsome, witty, and a well-to-do plastic surgeon. He asks her out and they have a great time. Things start moving fast, and even though Millie cautions Noa to slow down, the lonely ingenue rushes headlong into a weekend away with her new beau, trekking with him up to an opulent getaway in the mountains.
From there, Noas fortunes quickly change. Steve drugs her drink and suddenly hes not a suitor, hes her kidnapper. (NOTE: HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD  NECESSARY TO EVALUATE THE FILM.) When Noa awakens, shes chained to a wall in a room and it becomes her prison cell for the remainder of the story. Steve calmly tells her that she is to be harvested for body parts that will go to high-paying male customers who want to eat the flesh of women.
Now, at this juncture, the film could have gone a couple of ways. It could become a sly, dark comedy in the mode of Emerald Fennells feminist revenge movie PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN. Or it could have examined cannibalism as some sort of metaphorical rite of passage, similar to the way Julia Ducournau did in her droll French film RAW. Instead, Cave opts for two choices that cheapen the material. 
First, she directs Noas victimization to be far too horrifying. The young woman is utterly terrorized, humiliated, and yes, operated on, and its too traumatizing to watch. Perhaps being that vicious was what Cave wanted to reveal in Steve, but it ends up showcasing her prerogative too. Witnessing Noas hysteria as shes smacked around, wrestled to the ground, and much, much more is very hard to sit through. Edgar-Jones is such a terrific actress too that she makes Noas torment all the more palpable. The film starts to slowly shift from social satire to something more exploitative. Second, too much of the visuals become grosser and grosser. Not only does Cave showcase Steve and his various clients eating the slices of body parts with relish, but the director amps up the sound design to make each smack and slurp all the more disgusting. Its, ahem, salting the wound, if you will. Cave and Kahn also trot out too many egregious cliches in the final act as well, hitting those ridiculous tropes of victims not ensuring that the villain is down for the count. Some of it plays like FRIDAY THE 13Th with Jason Voorhees coming back again and again, and those are not the comparisons this film should be inviting. 
Ive sat through plenty of horror films that push the edge of unseemly visuals (THE THING) and even female abuse (I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE), but FRESH goes too far in embracing both styles. Caves film would have been just as effective with a subtler approach, less shown, more implied, and played cooler and more craftily throughout. Within this film are clever indictments of dating, misogyny, and even how women dont always have the backs of other women, but its hard to see all that when ones eyes are looking away in abject disgust. All in all, it made this exercise in terror simply too difficult to swallow.

104,JMI_Doc5_Fresh,"Modern dating can make a girl feel like a real slab of meat  at least, thats the central thesis of Mimi Caves debut Fresh, a horror-comedy with its teeth filed down to stubs. Hopefully, thisll make for a good story, Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) tells her BFF Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) before she heads off on a date with the most blandly vile man you can imagine: he monologues about acid reflux, tells her shed look prettier in a dress, spouts some racism at their waiter, and then calls Noa a bitch when she doesnt want to kiss him. When Noa gets back home, she tries to message another guy. He immediately responds with a dick pic.
So who could blame her for ignoring every red flag presented by Steve (Sebastian Stan), who approaches her in a grocery store and jokes about how cotton candy grapes really do taste like cotton candy. Steve seems all too perfect: he loves to dance in the middle of his living room, he doesnt want to rush into sex, and he isnt on social media (which the film treats as immediately suspect, but I would argue is the romantic ideal). Noa complains that dating reduces us all to the perfect projection, but shes just as willing to play into romcom fantasy: shes a pancakes out of a bag kind of girl, hes a sophisticated cocktail connoisseur. As Mollie points out: Its a straight girls fantasy come true!
Its a very relatable sort of hypocrisy. And when Steve whisks Noa away for a weekend out in nature, were meant to read it as passionate and spontaneous  right up to the moment the films title belatedly drops, around half an hour in, and we find out that hes actually a cannibal. Not a hobbyist cannibal, mind you, but a professional one, carving up women for wealthy clients while keeping them chained in his basement so the meat stays fresh. But Caves film proves that theres a clear difference between clever metaphors and satisfying ones.
The way Steve looks Noa dead in the eyes and says Im taking your ass is a very dark but funny joke. And Cave, certainly, leans into the films tongue-in-cheek quality. Fresh is shot by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, known for his work on both Hereditary and Midsommar, and the camera lurches around Steves mid-century basement dungeon (quite nice if you take it out of context) in queasy disbelief at whats going on. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Steve is carving up body parts  for human meatballs and human prosciutto  while dancing to Peter Ceteras Restless Heart. In another scene, he trudges into Noas room, whining about how exhausting it is to chop up women all day.
Stan has clearly been directed to give us Patrick Bateman with a Hannibal Lecter garnish, and its effective for what it is. But Bateman  of Bret Easton Elliss American Psycho  always represented a somewhat outsized vision of male narcissism, and Fresh cant ever decide how much this film should rub up against reality. Steve is a monster. But hes kind of a fun monster: at times a little goofy, and never fully detached from Stans sex appeal. Theres no moment where his mask slips and were exposed to something uncomfortably real. And that doesnt sit well with a film that so eagerly deploys the language of womens actual trauma. Noa, in her prison, can hear the voices of other women, who soothe each other with dreams of bloody vengeance against their captor, and reminders that its not your fault its always theirs.
But Fresh never really engages with the truth behind those words. Noas only hope of escape involves crossing what some might think is a moral line, as if theres no escaping the patriarchy unblemished. Its unclear, though, whether thats really the message here. Edgar-Jones, as watchable in the film as she may have been in Normal People, is never really allowed to develop Noa beyond her immediate victimhood. And what does the film have to say about race, since Mollie is never allowed to step out of the role of the Black, bisexual, ever-present emotional support of the white protagonist? To frame it in Freshs own language, all we get here is a single bite  not the whole steak.",JMI_Doc5_Fresh,JMI,Horror,Negative,Fresh
105,JMI_Doc6_Fresh,"Every now and then, a movie comes along that is a challenge to talk about because it deserves to have some mystery preserved about what it's really about.
Fresh is just such a movie.
With Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones and Captain America's Sebastian Stan in the lead roles, it starts off as an endearing romcom that's sparked by a meet-cute in a grocery store. We'd have happily watched two hours of that as the pair share strong chemistry, but Fresh is not that movie.
As director Mimi Cave (in her feature directorial debut) drops a brilliant delayed title sequence 30 minutes in, Fresh takes a turn for the messed-up and you watch on in horror as it unfolds. It won't lose its impact if you know exactly what's in store, but there's no doubt you'll get more from it by going in with... fresh eyes.
Our only word of warning, it's probably best you don't have a full meal before watching.
We'll preserve the mystery of Fresh's big reveal, but let's dig into more of the set-up. Frustrated with dating apps and painfully bad dates, Noa (Edgar-Jones) decides to take a chance on the charming Steve (Stan) when he tries to flirt over vegetables.
It doesn't take long for Noa to become smitten with Steve and despite her best friend Mollie's (Jonica T Gibbs) skepticism, Noa accepts his invitation to spend a romantic weekend away. Before you can say 'that's a TERRIBLE idea', Noa finds herself in a situation straight from anybody's worst nightmares.
Cave certainly drops hints in the first act of the movie of what's in store, such as a lot of extreme close ups of mouths. Combined with Steve seeming just too good to be true, you won't be surprised that he turns out to be a wrong'un. However, the execution of the twist and the way the movie unfolds every horrific detail is excellent.
There are times you might want to look away in horror at the situation Noa finds herself in, yet Sebastian Stan proves to be so charming even when we know Steve's true intentions. As he dances through the halls of his gorgeous home, you could totally imagine yourself being taken in by him.
Daisy Edgar-Jones is equally magnetic as Noa and much like the plot keeps you guessing, so does she. As Noa adjusts to her new reality, you'll question whether she's genuinely been taken in by Steve or if she's playing an even better game than him. You don't ever know where Fresh is going, keeping you engrossed throughout.
Her comic timing is spot-on too because, here's the thing, Fresh is often very funny. It's pitch-black humour, of course, as there's nothing inherently comedic about the situation itself. Yet the dark laughs in Lauryn Kahn's sharp script keep coming, serving to heighten the surreal vibe and keeping things from getting too heavy.
It's a bit of a shame that things settle into a more conventional rhythm in the final third. We do get another outstanding dance routine with Noa and Steve, but otherwise, we're firmly in standard thriller territory. There's catharsis in the finale, yet it all feels just a bit too neat for what's come before.
Everything else is too good to let the finale derail the entire movie though. With plenty of visual style and two superb lead performances, Fresh is a surprising and twisted treat of a thriller that you won't want to miss.",JMI_Doc6_Fresh,JMI,Horror,Positive,Fresh
106,JMI_Doc7_Fresh,"Mimi Caves debut feature Fresh sits in a tricky sort of niche where part of its appeal is the unexpected direction its story takes, but where discussion of that direction will inevitably give away some of its secrets. Even by mentioning this shift the damage has partly been done, since readers will now be aware that the film is not quite what it originally purports to be. It is the price we all have to pay, I suppose, since I think it would be irresponsible to let people start the film confidently expecting a romantic comedy and suddenly finding themselves watching a deeply queasy horror film instead. If I have spoiled things for you, I apologise, but trust that if you finish reading at the end of the next sentence I have spoiled far less that Freshs own promotion and advertising has. Its a great little film, and you should endeavour to give it a shot.
Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is sick of the dating scene: the awkward dinners, swiping left and right on dating apps, and particularly the unsolicited dick pics. A chance encounter in a supermarket introduces her to Steve (Sebastian Stan), a charismatic doctor that seems just the antidote to her dating blues.
The first half hour of Fresh really does feel like an energised and knowing reset of the romantic comedy. It boasts a tremendous female perspective on male behaviour  both in person and online  and very effectively showcases the challenges women face on a seemingly daily basis. It spikes the stereotypes, and allows a fresh sort of cheerful cynicism to keep it light but relevant. There is a warmth to the characters that makes it a very easy watch. Then it starts to instinctively feel wrong, and untrustworthy. Alarm bells sound in the mind as mixed behaviours build a growing sense of paranoia. By the time it is obvious that Noa is in trouble it is too late to escape, and Fresh slides into an entirely new vibe.
Fresh is stylishly produced, with a rich aesthetic that deliberately straddles the line between luxurious and nauseating. This sickly-sweet environment plays host to two excellent lead performances from Edgar-Jones and Stan. They embrace the films often absurd developments, and go a long way in convincing the audience to accept a fairly unlikely situation. There is strong supporting work here too: chiefly from Dayo Okeniyi as the amusing bartender Paul and particularly Jonica T. Gibbs as Noas enterprising best friend Millie.
It isnt perfect. For one thing the third act rather feels like Cave and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn gave up on juggling all of the narrative balls and simply threw them in the air and ran away. This is particularly true when it comes to the character of Ann (Charlotte Le Bon), whose role in the narrative is set up with intrigue but abandoned in a panic. The films overarching themes also feel very slightly underdeveloped. Then there is the problem of violence: the jump between genres is viscerally jarring  as I suspect it is intended to be  and it is unclear at first just how graphic the film is going to become.
Altogether this is a superb first-time feature: smart, provocative, unexpectedly weird and often very, very funny. That said, its idiosyncratic delivery may be  like some of its characters  an acquired taste.

107,JMI_Doc8_Fresh,"If you saw Netflix's recent ""The Tinder Swindler"" and thought it was unsettling, then just wait until you get a load of ""Fresh."" This sharp, witty and downright shocking horror-comedy caused jaws to drop when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January of 2022, and now all of us can share in the exasperation as it lands on Hulu this Friday.
""Fresh"" comes from first-time feature-film director Mimi Cave, from a script by relatively unknown scribe, Lauryn Kahn. Both make a lasting impact, but maybe not as much as their breakthrough, stand-out star, 23-year-old Daisy Edgar-Jones, who is absolutely phenomenal in the lead role.
When we first meet Noa (Edgar-Jones), she is swiping left on a random dating app, and navigating the hellish waters that all single people know and loathe. She has a catastrophic date with Chad (Brett Dier) and is fairly certain that she will live life alone. And that's OK by the way, because Noa is a strong, independent woman, with a super-supportive best friend in Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs).
But her life gets up-ended when she runs in to a cute guy at the grocery store of all places. Steve (a never-been-better Sebastian Stan) is handsome, charming and somewhat dorky, and the vibe works on Noa. She slowly decides that she likes his company, they hook up and soon after Steve invites her on a remote adventure to a romantic cabin in the woods.
That's when ""Fresh"" takes a hard turn, and I do mean HARD. Yes, Mollie - and even to some extent, Noa - see some red flags, but Noa's relationship and attraction to Steve is plausible and realistic. Should she go on a such a date with a guy she just met? Probably not. And once you see where things lead, that answer will change to OH MY GOD OF COURSE NOT.
To spoil where things go from there would undercut the impact of the film, but it's turns are much more than a gimmick. To generalize things, let's just say that Steve turns out to not be who Noa thought he was. The title sequence in fact, comes about 30 minutes into the film, and the reason is mostly because that's when the film really begins.
Soon after the revelation is revealed, things bog down just a bit before ramping back up towards the end. But this is a delicious - OK, that's the wrong choice of words - a fascinatingly entertaining movie that never judges or demonizes its characters, despite the incredibly horrific things that some of them may choose to do. It's so bold that it even leaves a few story threads untouched, as if to suggest that there may be future chapters in the ""Fresh"" universe...a notion that I for one, would eat up in a heartbeat.
The writing is strong, the laughs and plenty and the shocks are delivered with precision. There's also more than one dance sequences as well as an unforgettable kitchen montage scene with a fabulously loose Sebastian Stan. None of this works though without the stellar performances from Edgar-Jones (as well as Stan), not to mention the large contributions from the small supporting players.
""Fresh"" is best if you go into it without knowing too much about it, but it'd be reckless to suggest that you shouldn't also brace yourself for all possibilities. This is definitely an acquired taste that will last with me for a very, very long time.",JMI_Doc8_Fresh,JMI,Horror,Positive,Fresh
108,JMI_Doc9_Fresh,"The opening credits of Fresh don't arrive until the 33-minute mark. That's appropriate because the first half-hour feels like a short film in its own right. It tells the story of a woman and man meeting, falling for each other, and prepping to take their first getaway as a couple. Thirty-three minutes in is precisely when the story shifts, shedding the romantic-comedy vibe it starts off with and clueing us in that something sinister is about to happen. Subversion of this sort is pervasive in the movie. In fact, it's the most admirable of many admirable qualities.
I'm not going to tell you anything that happens after the extended intro. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a perpetually unlucky-in-love single woman. We first meet her on a blind date from hell, where the guy turns into a misogynist prick as soon as she refuses to kiss him goodnight. Soon after, she has an encounter with plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan) in a grocery store. They flirt, she gives him her number, they hook up, etc. Noa's best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) thinks Steve sounds suspicious. He's got no Instagram account, after all! Noa nevertheless agrees to go on a weekend trip with her new boyfriend. First, though, they have to swing by his place, a large home out in the middle of nowhere.
What happens next is shocking, gross, and very, very bad for Noa. The twist may be off-putting for some viewers, but don't bail. Fresh is one of the most smartly-written horror films of the last decade, and what happens  while intentionally repellant  is handled with a flair for astute psychological details. You can already surmise that Steve is not a good guy. What he does and why he does it prove to be more substantive than we often see in horror, speaking to the idea of one's soul being susceptible to the corrupting influence of ego.
Noa, meanwhile, quickly comes to realize that she can't merely jump out a window. To escape, she'll need to read Steve like a book, figuring out a non-sexual way to seduce him and, consequently, make him vulnerable. Doing that forces her to go to uncomfortable places. Lauryn Kahn's superb screenplay gets those ideas across intelligently, mixing them with thrilling twists you don't anticipate.
As well written as it is, Fresh requires pitch-perfect performances to fully succeed, and it's got them. Daisy Edgar-Jones exquisitely conveys how Noa sheds her timidity in the situation, channeling her fear into a desire to outsmart Steve at all costs. The actress never once overplays it, allowing us to develop a sincere rooting interest in what happens to the character. Sebastian Stan matches her beat-for-beat with a very different kind of role. He makes Steve unhinged, yet in a way that feels credible. Instead of a generic villain, the movie gives us one with more than a semblance of humanity  a fact that serves to make him even scarier.
Director Mimi Cave finds the right tone for the picture. Instead of making a grungy-looking horror flick like Saw, she shoots in often attractive interior locations and injects many scenes with an undertone of pitch black humor, just to help the admittedly gruesome events go down a little easier. You may remember the scene in American Psycho where Christian Bale (as Patrick Bates) cheerfully sings along to Hip to Be Square by Huey Lewis and the News as he prepares to slaughter a guy with an ax. Fresh is often played at that kind of slightly-elevated level. There's even a similar scene where Steve does something horrific while bopping to an old Peter Cetera song.
The story builds to a climax that made me do something I've rarely ever done during a horror movie  I involuntarily put my hand over my mouth and gasped. When Noa finally makes her move, it's quite a sight to see. Fresh earns its ultra-intense finale. With a carefully constructed plot and impeccable lead performances, this is a top-tier horror movie from start to finish. Your chills will get chills.",JMI_Doc9_Fresh,JMI,Horror,Positive,Fresh
109,JMI_Doc10_Fresh,"No matter how many digital barricades we place between us  social media, dating services, live webcams  there is no avoiding the moment when you must open the door and let someone inside. For single women, that moment has always been a dangerous proposition.
Mimi Cave gives us a fresh take on relationship horror in her impressive directorial debut, Fresh. Themes of consumption, possession, and loneliness swirl into a blood-soaked fairy tale gone terrifyingly wrong. Fresh is smart, transgressive, stomach-churning fun that also offers a few sly insights into the modern dating game.
Ive been alone so long, Im actually pretty good at it, our young heroine Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) confides to her prospective new beau, Steve (a refreshingly un-superhero turn from Sebastian Stan). Cut to: Noa and Steve sleeping together and then hastily absconding to a surprise vacation destination of Steves choosing. Noas no-nonsense BFF Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) suspects something right away, hilariously accusing Noa of being dick-matized. But Noa is an independent 20-something woman who can Google with the best of them, and dammit, she deserves happiness, too! So off they go!
The first chunk of Fresh plays out like a sendup of indie relationship films. Theres the adorable late-night supermarket meeting between Noa and Steve, plenty of profound college-dormitory-style banter, and even some impromptu dancing! And then right around the 40-minute mark, something happens something very terrible.
To spoil the secrets of Fresh would be a cinematic crime. It reveals itself first with the subtlety of a feather before slamming you in the face with a sledgehammer (or perhaps a shovel). Its a startling tonal shift that works completely because Cave and her screenwriter (Lauryn Kahn) took the time to earn our investment in these characters.
Almost everything from this point forward is disturbing. Cave fosters a sense of unease with her vertiginous, close-up lensing of faces and body parts; the throbbing vein in someones neck, a flushed cheek, a chewing mouth overflowing with food. Its a stylistic choice that dovetails perfectly with themes of dehumanization and, ultimately, possession. Just what does Steve value in Noa? For that matter, what does any man value in a woman? These are questions that bear constant re-evaluation as Fresh progresses toward its ultra-violent conclusion.
Unfortunately, Fresh falters in the final act, relying upon horror clichés to unnecessarily dial up the suspense. Its a disappointing misstep for such an ingenious construction. There is also the matter of an unsatisfying subplot that never meshes with the films primary story. But these are minor quibbles for a film that flirts with artistic greatness.
Cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski (Hereditary, Midsommar) and production designer Jennifer Morden play a prominent role in defining that artistry. Every painting, every piece of furniture, every kitchen utensil is meticulously selected for maximum discomfort. Even more effective is the soundtrack, which makes the most disconcerting use of 80s pop music classics since American Psycho. Indeed, Fresh owes a great deal to Mary Harrons 2000 classic, both stylistically and thematically.
Director Cave has likely carved a place in Sundance Film Festival lore with this audacious debut. Thanks to her bold visual storytelling and stellar lead performances from Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones, Fresh seems poised to earn cult status. It also reiterates what a powerful venue horror can be for tackling important social issues. Mostly, though, its just good creepy fun.",JMI_Doc10_Fresh,JMI,Horror,Positive,Fresh
140,ARB_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,"Remember that scene in Step Brothers, when a sleepwalking Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly end up wrecking their parentsâ kitchen? My god, that was hilarious. What about that part in Talladega Nights, when Ferrellâs NASCAR champion and his best friend/sidekick say grace at the dinner table (âDear Tiny Jesus, your golden fleece diapers and tiny little balled-up fists â¦â)? So riotous. Or how about any random scene from, say, Anchorman or Walk Hard? You canât go wrong with the formerâs âAfternoon Delightâ sing-along, or anything in the latter involving drugs or Dewey Coxâs Dylan phase. Weâre crying just thinking about them. Itâs easier, not to mention far less agonizing, to go back and just reminisce about those Ferrell/Reilly greatest-hits moments than to try and reckon with Holmes & Watson. Itâs so painfully unfunny weâre not sure it can legally be called a comedy. Letâs put it another way: You know that story about the monkey paw, where a grieving mother wishes for something and her wish comes true, only itâs all twisted and wrong and horrible? Someone may have gotten a hold of one of those talismans and said, âIâd love a Step Brothers reunion, maybe with a recognizable I.P.â and then a rotting, shambling corpse is suddenly knocking on the multiplex doors. The idea of giving Arthur Conan Doyleâs famous characters to a great screen duo surely seemed like a genius idea. Youâd almost have to willfully want to squander the notion to screw it up this badly. Youâd also have to be ignorant of the fact that, even if with A-list comic talent capable of turning this into more than just the sum of its wink-nudge Sherlock-foolery, you have to give them something more than a rough sketch to work with. That, dear friends, is elementa â¦ sorry, weâre too depressed by this whole thing to even finish the joke. Perhaps itâs best to use deductive logic to figure out what exactly happened here. Observe, the high concept/low return ratio, suggesting someone merely scribbled down an elevator pitch at the last second before a meeting â âUm, Ferrell and Reilly as, ah, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watsonâ â then were surprised to suddenly get a greenlight. Look closely at the recognizable traits of Ferrellâs master detective and Reillyâs beta-male sidekick, all of which are slightly exaggerated for effect and retro-fitted for the starsâ personae yet never really utilized beyond reiterating: Yup, heâs smart but also arrogant and stupid, and the other guyâs his buddy! The desperate, extreme mugging of both actors â truly, a telltale sign that even they realized that the story, involving the escape of Holmesâ archenemy Moriarty (really, Ralph Fiennes? Really?) and a plot to kill the Queen, wasnât much to hang gags upon, so theyâd better make faces ASAP. Notice, amateur sleuths, the anachronistic touches â Selfies! Pay-Per-View! MAGA hats! â and in-case-of-emergency-hit-someone-in-head crappy slapstick in lieu of an almost complete absence of actual jokes. Behold how a sequence involving Watson and Rebecca Hallâs female medical practitioner is take-off on a scene from Ghost, a movie thatâs almost 30 years old, yet thereâs a generic hip-hop-lite soundtrack in a âhow do you do, fellow kids?â attempt to be hip. (Thereâs also a character who pretends to be a cat, because why not?) Peruse the IMDb page of one Etan Cohen, a gent with an impressive screenwriting resumÃ© (he had a hand in the scripts for Idiocracy and Tropic Thunder), yet is the director responsible for the wretched Ferrell/Kevin Hart 2015 project Get Hard. Kindly note how what should have been no-brainer wins, like an Alan Menken-penned musical number and several parodies of slo-mo scenes Ã  la the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock movies, are virtually smothered in the crib. And as we close the case file on this crime, perhaps itâs worth jotting down in the dossier that while itâs not unusual for studios to not screen movies for critics and whatnot ahead of time, the combination of a somewhat muted marketing campaign and slipping it into theaters on Christmas sans much promotion suggests that even the distributors knew they had a cut-bait situation on their hands. Also: You can only swindle audiences by thinking you simply throw A-list stars in anything and people will still show up, drooling like Pavlovâs pups, for so long before the echo in empty theaters is deafening. At one point in Holmes & Watson, a character goes undercover as a manure salesman and begins screaming, âHorseshit for sale! Will anyone buy my horseâs shit?â Itâs the one genuinely honest, self-aware moment in the movie.",ARB_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
141,ARB_Doc2_HolmesAndWatson,"Out of some morbid curiosity, and perhaps a self-destructive streak, I decided to watch the much-hated Holmes & Watson starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Although many adore the abrasive charms of Talladega Nights (2006) and Step Brothers (2008), these movies have never appealed to me, often outstaying their welcome around the twenty-minute mark. My decision to screen their latest comedy, which bombed during last yearâs holiday season, was less about genuine interest than peer pressure. âItâs so bad,â a number of people have told me. âYou have to see it.â Putting it on largely as background noise, I instantly regretted the decision. Holmes & Watson is frustratingly stupid within the first seconds (it opens with a quote from Hannah Montana) and continues for a painfully long, utterly laughless 90 minutes. In the movie, Ferrell and Reilly reduce two of literatureâs most celebrated, intelligent characters to bungling idiots. Performed with vaguely effeminate mannerisms that should come across as an insult to the British, Holmes (Ferrell) and Watson (Reilly) investigate, sort of, a mystery to which the details are instantly foggyâhonestly, as I write this, I just watched the movie and couldnât tell you what itâs about. I can tell you itâs set in London during the early 1900s, and the productionâs costumes, hair and makeup, and interiors look professional. The cast is also amazing; it boasts several excellent, but absolutely wasted UK performers (Ralph Fiennes, Hugh Laurie, Kelly Macdonald, Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon). The largely reference-based humour is dated, to the point where you wonder if the joke is so meta that itâs less about the reference itself than a self-aware gag about the dated quality of the reference. An absurd morgue scene riffs on the Patrick Swayze/Demi Mooreâs pottery scene in Ghost (1990); the ending features Billy Zane reprising his role from Titanic (1997); and several sequences lampoon those moments from Sherlock Holmes and its 2011 sequel, when Robert Downey Jr. anticipated a series of moves that would incapacitate his enemy. Elsewhere, the movieâs attempts at randomness fall flat. Jokes about Holmesâ intelligence giving him psychic powers do not pair well with his inability to choose a style of hat, a thread that often leaves him looking like a pimp stereotype. An out-of-left-field musical number ushers in the third act, while the modern hip-hop music courtesy of Mark Mothersbaugh desperately wants you to know itâs out of place. And the whole time, youâll be wondering why any of this exists. The entire thing is embarrassing and difficult to endure. Despite the short runtime, I stopped the movie more than once to take a break; however, I resisted giving up on it completely, if only because I didnât want to waste the $5 rental charge. I can only be thankful that I didnât venture into the theater, as I would have been forced to endure the full 90 minutes in a single sitting, which would have been something akin to self-imposed waterboarding. Truly, the only laughs to be had are those of disbelief at just how awful this experience is.",ARB_Doc2_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
142,ARB_Doc3_HolmesAndWatson,"There's a moment during the stunningly abysmal Holmes & Watson where you're looking up at the screen and you're watching the immensely talented duo of John C. Reilly and Steve Coogan and, at least if you're an avid moviegoer, you realize that these actors, awful beyond awful in this film, have both turned in award-worthy, and I'd dare say Oscar worthy, performances this very same year in the extraordinary Stan & Ollie. The realization hits you hard. I mean seriously hard. It's difficult to describe just how wide this chasm is, but the closest thing I can find to describe it is the year that Eddie Murphy garnered serious Oscar buzz for Dreamgirls but just as nominations were being submitted Murphy's similarly devastatingly awful Norbit was released in theaters. Not surprisingly, all the Oscar buzz in the world couldn't save Murphy's reputation and despite a tremendous Dreamgirls performance it's safe to say that Norbit came close to killing Murphy's career. While Reilly is likely safe from a similar fate here, especially given he's actually given award-worthy performances this year in both Stan & Ollie and The Sisters Brothers, a film so incredibly awful as Holmes & Watson may very well sound the off-key death chimes on Ferrell's already waning career as audiences tire of his man-child shtick and his films exude the rotted stench of cinematic desperation. And, let me just say, this is coming from someone who considers himself a Will Ferrell fan. There's simply no excuse whatsoever for a film as awful as Holmes & Watson. Holmes & Watson is so awful that people in third world countries who've never seen a film before would watch the film and decide they've not been missing anything. Holmes & Watson is simply lazy. It's lazy writing. It's lazy filmmaking. It's haphazard, self-indulgent, and so utterly devoid of anything resembling humor that it's inexcusable that it was even released in theaters.

143,ARB_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,"A previously undiscovered short story shows what the denizens of 221B Baker Street really think of Holmes and Watson. It was a cold night at 21B Baker Street. The air hung heavy with tobacco smoke as myself and my constant companion, Mr Sherlock Holmes sat in front of a fire that provided much needed warmth, given that we were chilled to the bone â both physically and spiritually. âA most intriguing entertainment we witnessed tonight, Holmes,â I ventured, punctuating the silence. âIntriguing. If thatâs what you want to call it, Watson,â Holmes replied with a dry sarcasm. âPerhaps I am being a little too kind,â I murmured. âKind. Hah!,â his cruel stab of laughter slicing through the thick air. âYou know I had always had my doubts about you chronicling our adventures, but I let you do so. I even tolerated your more extravagant literary flourishes. And I will admit that those who have interpreted said adventures have often done so with adequacy. Basil Rathbone did fine workâ¦â âYes,â Holmes said in a neutral enough tone that I was not sure whether he was mocking me. âAs I was saying, the likes of Jeremy Brett and that young Cumberbatch have all done a fine job of bringing me to other realms â although perhaps they do not capture some of the true nature of my deductive skills. Even with his unfortunate interest in affairs of the flesh and cross-dressing, I thought Robert Downey Jr. brought something of interest.â âAnd I thought Dr. Watson was dashingâ¦â I added, but Holmes was now stood up and agitating around the room. âBut this Holmes and Watson? Will Ferrell makes a mockery of me and my good name,â he thundered. âYou may not believe it, Watson, but I know humor and it does not take one of Londonâs greatest detectives to tell you that there was none to be found. Yes, our adventures have never been the most comedic. But do you remember Without A Clue with Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley? Not the height of comedic achievement but it provided adequate mirth. Even the Guy Ritchie films have a certain humor to them. Our escapades can be made funny, if one tries.â âIâm sorry, Holmes,â I said, wearily. âBut when I heard that the film hadnât been screened for critics or that Sony had apparently tried to sell the rights off, I assumed that other forces were at work. Not merely that it wasnât good.â âWhat do I always tell you, Watson? Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. And the truth is that this film was reputed to be a pile of what I believe our American cousins call âhot garbageâ, before it was ever forced upon an audience.â âI know, Holmes,â I concurred. âBut I thought Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly would prove to be more than adequate in the lead roles and ably supported by a bevy of British character actors.â âAh, Watson, ever the optimist,â said Holmes, as he slunk back down into his chair. âBut despite their previous roles, nothing works, does it? The script is leaden â with its lazy device of âput a modern invention into a past timeâ and references to motion pictures that are decades old â while the cast seem to wish they were somewhere else. Both Ferrell and Reilly are somewhat wooden, and clearly going through the motions.â âNot to mention their accents,â I added. âYou may have read my monograph âBad British Accents â From Dick Van Dyke to Don Cheadleâ. I am afeared that I will have to re-write it to take account of those travesties.â âBut surely there were one or two moments of mirth? Or one or two good action scenes?â I ventured. âOh, come now, Watson. When not being a lazy parody of Guy Ritchie films, the film had nothing to distinguish itself. The slapstick was poorly done, the jokes were telegraphed and it was a thorough waste of everyoneâs time.â âI suppose youâre right, Holmes. Itâs just when it won four Razzie awards and was utterly condemned by the public, I hoped that it might be some sort of over-reaction.â âAnd that is why you remain at my side, Watson,â said Holmes, gently. âYour kindness complements my pure deductive skill. But you have to sometimes remember that things are what they are. And Holmes and Watson is a failure of the highest magnitude. Big budget filmmaking with no heart or no soul. I deduce that everyone in it has done it for the money â there is no other logical reason for it to be unleashed on the world. If you take our names away â and, by jove, I wish they would â then you just have a farrago of period antics.â Silence returned, as our disappointment in the eveningâs entertainment had rendered us mute. âYou know, I think to get over this I might need more than a 7 per cent solution,â said Holmes, softly. Normally, I would chastise Holmes for his excesses, but I decided that now was a time to quietly acquiesce. Rather, I quietly hoped that this film would not be enough to sully our good names. I would just have to invite all involved to take a trip to Switzerland. Thereâs a waterfall Iâd like to show them.",ARB_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
144,ARB_Doc5_HolmesAndWatson,"The start of Holmes & Watson is both cynical and inexplicable. Dr. Watson (John C. Reilly), apparently fed up of his life, is about to launch himself from the roof of Sherlock Holmesâs flat building onto his prized plant, which Holmes (Will Ferrell) doesnât want him to. âFall over there!â he says, because a human life is less important than a plantâs, according to the film. Cynical, because of that. Inexplicable, because the two for some reason become friends right after. The basic premise of the film is this: Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) has apparently fled to America to avoid arrest, and used a lookalike to take the fall. Lestrade (Rob Bydon) doesnât believe him, but Holmes runs with the theory regardless. Meanwhile, people are still being murdered, and the question that keeps being asked is, âif the criminal who can outsmart Holmes isnât Moriarty, then who is it?â. It all culminates into some half-baked mystery about someone wanting to kill the Queen of England (Pam Ferris). Holmes & Watsonâs main downfall is that it doesnât make sense on any account. If Moriarty is clever enough to avoid being captured by Sherlock Holmes, why would he have fled to America to begin with? Why does he send a dead body in a cake to Buckingham Palace? To send a message? Surely, if youâre going to commit such a high-profile murder you wouldnât want anyone to know you were planning it, even if you were Moriarty. The fallacies donât end there. Writer/director Etan Cohen couldnât have understood what film he was making, because conceptually Holmes and Watson is all over the place. At the beginning of the film, Holmes is portrayed as someone who only thinks heâs hyper-intelligent, but is actually more incompetent than the people around him. But a couple of scenes later, Holmes will actually be intelligent, and then the comedy will stem from the fact that the people surrounding him are portrayed as idiots. The film is lazily written, too. Itâs very difficult to tell whether it was supposed to be some kind of referential humour, but thereâs a boxing scene which plays out almost exactly like a scene from one of the earlier Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films (of which I wasnât a fan, but compared to this one, theyâre like Citizen Kane). The joke is, of course, that the method of taking out his foe doesnât work, and he almost gets pummeled. But the film has no sense of comic timing, and by that point, the joke has already been used a couple of times, and just feels exhausting. The same is true of almost the entire script. There are chuckles here and there, but nowhere near enough to build a feature film on. Iâll give Etan Cohen this: he was trying to make a clever comedy. Or at least, I think so. There are a couple of jokes which were designed to be political commentary, which are pretty much all critical of the Trump Administration. None of them are funny, but itâs a rare occasion in which the film is actually well-meaning. Theyâre well-tread comedic ground: jibes about Americaâs lack of gun control and its faux-democratic government. Thereâs an earlier scene in which Sherlock Holmes, having not yet found his signature hat, dons some kind of weird Make America Great Again fez. Itâs a joke that has no political leanings, itâs just Etan Cohen telling the audience, âlook, itâs that thing you recogniseâ. A lot of the other jokes come across as less altruistic. Thereâs a lengthy running gag about one of Holmesâs maid having group orgies in Watsonâs bedroom. Bizarrely, one of her partners is Mark Twain, and thereâs another famous author in there too, who Iâve forgotten the name of. Most of the humour in the situation seems to stem from Holmes and Watsonâs judgement of her sexual choices, and the filmâs attitude towards sex makes the whole thing feel like a relic from a bygone era. And then there are the anachronisms, some of which were clearly unintentional, though not all of them were. The film is set in the late nineteenth century. It allegedly starts in the year 1881, yet has a major plot point which revolves around the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, which never sailed until 1912. Either Etan Cohen never bothered to research the dates, or thought audiences wouldnât have noticed. Iâm not sure which is worse. Billy Zane (famous for playing the villainous Cal Hockley in James Cameronâs film) turns up for a pointless pick-up-the-check cameo, which lasts for all of five seconds, and the film ends. Those in the audience who managed to stick the entire thing out must have felt pretty short-changed. Holmes & Watson is likely to make even the least demanding cinema-goers feel as if theyâve had their intelligence insulted. Some people already consider Holmes and Watson to be one of the worst films of all time. Itâs not difficult to understand why. Itâs a real stinker.",ARB_Doc5_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
145,ARB_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,"Many distinguished actors have played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, but few have done so with quite the unhinged abandon of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly â reunited here a decade after the unforgettable Step Brothers, where they starred as grown men still living with their parents and squabbling like little kids. This PG-13, 90-minute-long comedy directed by screenwriter and director Etan Cohen, Holmes and Watson is essentially a continuation of the same project, in the form of a parody that has less to do with the writings of Arthur Conan Doyle than it does with the spectacle of man-children playing dress-ups. Etan Cohen (Get Hard) is the credited writer-director, but we're given the impression â accurate or not â that the leads are pretty much inventing their lines as they go along. As the world's greatest detective, Ferrell purses his lips, flutters his hands, and speaks in a strangled approximation of a refined English accent. As his loyal sidekick, Reilly stands by, nodding sagely and occasionally breaking out into a girlish giggle. Both spend a lot of time screaming at the tops of their lungs, recklessly brandishing dangerous weapons and congratulating each other on their superiority to everyone else â in a manner only possible for a couple of all-American yahoos pretending to be upper-crust 19th-century Brits. If you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time. In theory this dynamic duo is dashing around jolly old London in pursuit of nemesis Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), who has apparently returned from beyond the grave to sabotage Holmes' birthday party and threaten the life of Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris). The plot is so rickety it could fall apart at any moment ... which of course is partly the point in a film that aims for the pure, old-fashioned silliness of The Goon Show or early Steve Martin. Holmes and Watson is not for everybody, but if you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time. The joy of a relentlessly juvenile approach is that it succeeds in making every previous version of the material look just as ridiculous: Guy Ritchie's macho vehicles for Robert Downey Jr come in for special ribbing, but Cohen and his stars have surely taken a look at the BBC's maudlin Sherlock as well. There are broader satirical implications, too, even setting aside the handful of obligatory Trump jokes. With his brash eccentricities, his disdain for women and his superhuman"" intellect",ARB_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
146,ARB_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,"One of the yearâs most critically shellacked movies (the pros were forced to watch it in theaters on Christmas Day alongside the common hordes), Holmes & Watson begins as ineptly as any comedy Iâve seen, and then settles into an agreeably silly groove that had the common hordes around me yukking it up. When itâs bad it is, indeed, painful, but even third-rate Will Ferrell + John C. Reilly is more inspired than the noisy contraptions on either side of it in the multiplex. The twist is to make Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyleâs pillar of 19th-century rationalism, into the latest of Ferrellâs posturing child-men, another symbol of the patriarchyâs dimming light. After being tricked by grade-school classmates into kissing the arse of an ass when he thought heâd be kissing a girl, Holmes purges himself of emotion and becomes a giant brain doling out punishments to those who would underestimate his powers of ratiocination. Those powers in Holmes & Watson are rather elastic. Where the trend in modern Holmesiana has been to show the great detective as a stunted giant, Ferrell stunts the stuntedness, playing Holmes as a prissy drama queen whoâs at least half idiot and always â even when brilliant â a fount of chaos. He and his schoolmate, Dr. John Watson (Reilly), have never really left the playground. The rub is not that Ferrell and Reilly act like overgrown 11-year-olds â that was the hook in Adam McKayâs Step Brothers, a high-water mark in modern infantile comedy. Itâs that Ferrellâs brand of low comedy is best executed with high instincts â i.e., without the nudge-nudges and wink-winks. Watch Ferrell and Reilly make the breathless case to Richard Jenkinsâs exasperated father/stepfather in Step Brothers that they should be allowed to create a bunk bed by setting one twin bed atop another: Their enthusiasm is contagious. Watch the pairâs Funny or Die line-for-line reenactment of the unintentionally surreal duet between Bing Crosby at deathâs door and a joyless David Bowie: so subtle, so sublime. Holmes & Watson, on the other hand, is camp. Worse: rhythmless camp. It has been consistently misdirected by its screenwriter, Etan Coen (no âh,â different guy), whose idea of editing is to make throwaway jokes broad and broad jokes bludgeoning. As a director, Coen commits comedyâs most cardinal sin: He gets between us and the performers. (To see how central rhythm is, watch Reilly and Steve Cooganâs delicate work in Stan and Ollie: The beats â and micro-beats â are exquisite.) The first 15 minutes or so of Holmes & Watson made me doubt Iâd last the next 90, an impulse to flee that I also detected, with Holmesian sensitivity, in Ralph Fiennes, whoâs stuck playing Dr. Moriarty and/or a look-alike. You can read his frozen face: What did I get myself into? Rob Brydonâs Inspector Lestrade is photographed to appear as diminutive as possible, and the actor gets to show none of his improvisatory gifts. Kelly Macdonald as Mrs. Hudson reveals why sheâs always so endearingly low-key: When she goes big, sheâs like a high-school actress. Rebecca Hall brings both poise and gusto to the part of a woman doctor from America (a rarity in the 19th century), but the direction lets her down. Hall has one of the many potentially great jokes that donât land because the camera isnât in the right place: an enlightened bit about women doctors making only 30 cents for every for dollar made by men, followed by a proud account of how she treats female hystericsâ brains with blasts of electricity to shock them into submission. As in many Ferrell-McKay projects (McKay is a producer), thereâs a sprinkling of political jokes (aimed at Trump) and digs at Americaâs gun mania that get laughs because theyâre jarringly anachronistic, not because they have any real wit. But Reilly has such an endearing presence â and so much genuine affection for Ferrell â that his bits often work in spite of everything. His Watson is a sweet-natured but dim fellow who falls in love with everyone onscreen. His bromance with Holmes remains in full flower, while women leave him downright discombobulated â including the severe Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris), whose hand he seizes and strokes, smitten. He goes even more gaga for Hallâs doctor, with whom he performs an autopsy modeled on a famous movie love scene, while Holmes is enraptured by the doctorâs mute sidekick (Lauren Lapkus), who mirrors his practice of voraciously eating raw onions. That gag doesnât really land, either, but gets a point for weirdness. And Lapkus is all in. Then comes a gorgeous routine, in which Holmes beats Watson at imaginary chess, then rock-paper-scissors, then Battleship. Itâs precise â elegant even. Hugh Laurie shows up as Holmesâs brother Mycroft and demonstrates what he and Ferrell can do with a little focus: a telepathic exchange in which they lean in their heads and furrow their brows and bug their eyes. Itâs the height of silliness. Steve Coogan is almost as good as a forger with a metal hand, whose air quotes had me laughing for a full 15 seconds after it ended. Eventually, I relaxed my critical faculties, shrugging off the many, many awful jokes (anything about onanism, an extended coals-to-Newcastle non-gag) and joyfully receiving the good ones. A climactic musical number (it could be a parody of Les Miz) is positively award-worthy. Ferrell and Reilly have real musical chops. I should mention that the audience left the theater in a good mood, unaware (it was the 12:55 p.m. show) of Holmes & Watsonâs Rotten Tomatoes score, which hovered for a while at 0. Iâm happy to bump that up, partly because I cherish the Ferrell-Reilly team, partly because of that musical number. I also worry that we undervalue silliness as we fight the larger fight against ignorance and mendacity in all its manifestations. No brain cells are harmed by Holmes & Watson, just given a few hours to rest and regenerate.",ARB_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
147,ARB_Doc8_HolmesAndWatson,"Etan Cohen didnât write Holmes & Watson as a vehicle for Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Indeed, at one point Ferrell was going to play Dr. Watson, with Sacha Baron Cohen (no relation) as Sherlock. Itâs hard to tell how much the script changed when Ferrell and Reilly got onboard as the detective and his sidekick (Cohen is still the only credited writer), but you get the sense that some of the starsâ semi-improvised on-set clownery made it into the final cut â a desperate attempt by two seasoned pros to turn a lukewarm screenplay into something hot. It didnât work, but at least they tried. Cohen (not to be confused with Ethan Coen, half of the Coen brothers), who directed Ferrell in the similarly half-arsed Get Hard, is making his first outing as sole writer-director, and his story of Holmes and Watson trying to stop a plot to kill Queen Victoria in the 1890s is insufficiently funny or clever (or cleverly stupid). As a Will Ferrell superfan, Iâm the exact target audience for this, and it only barely worked for me. The stars are certainly in their element, with a dynamic similar to their first outing together, Talladega Nights. Ferrellâs Sherlock Holmes is an arrogant blowhard who dismisses the contributions of others; Reillyâs Dr. Watson is Holmesâ biggest fan and doormat. They get to do silly things like overreact to a swarm of bees (Watson fires a gun at them) and take turns screaming the housekeeperâs name when they need her. Their boyish glee when (for example) a drunken Holmes encourages a drunken Watson to send a lady a late-night telegram (âAre you awake? Stop.â) is infectious. But the well that Cohenâs script goes back to the most often is the Jokes About How Primitive the 1800s Are Compared to Now well. Dr. Watsonâs state-of-the-art âmodern medicineâ involves regular prescriptions of heroin and opium; the gymnasium has a âlung exercise stationâ where people smoke cigarettes to improve their health; and so on. Running along the same lines are the jokes where an 1890s practice predicts the future: the aforementioned booty call; a âself-photographâ with a giant box camera; the spin class at the gym with everybody on stationary penny-farthings; the invention of pay-per-view when Holmes and Watson charge spectators to watch a boxing match, and the âLetâs get ready to rumble!â guy shows up to say âLetâs get ready to scuffle!â You get the idea. All of this is fitfully amusing, but not enough for Cohen to build the whole movie around it. The story is a mess. Convinced that his nemesis Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) isnât behind the plot to kill fusty Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) â for whom Watson has the hots, by the way â Holmes tries to determine who is, while in the background his failure to appreciate Watsonâs assistance percolates. There are two American women involved, Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her mute assistant Millie (Lauren Lapkus), who thinks sheâs a cat for some reason. Holmes falls for the cat girl, Watson for the doctor (they have a very hard time believing a lady could be a doctor, of course), but the only real impact this subplot has on the film is forcing main action to pause now and then for a courtship scene. Everyoneâs careers will survive, and clips of the funny parts will probably make their way onto the internet. I will fondly remember Ferrellâs haughty, pursed-lipped Holmes and his not-quite-passable English accent, even if the the film in which he appeared was strained and erratic.",ARB_Doc8_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
148,ARB_Doc9_HolmesAndWatson,"Finding out what went wrong with âHolmes and Watson,â Will Ferrell and John C. Reillyâs half-baked take on the famous characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, doesnât require a brilliant deductive mind. In all honesty, all it would take to solve the case of why this comedy doesnât hit the mark is to just take a look at whose name isnât listed under âdirector.â The missing man is not Professor Moriarty this time around. Itâs Adam McKay. The powerhouse comedy filmmaker behind previously successful pairings of Ferrell and Reilly, in âStep Brothersâ and âTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,â has taken a breather from traditional studio comedies as of late to focus on ferocious, Oscar-ready political satire, and âHolmes and Watsonâ makes you realize what the comedy world misses in McKayâs absence. The filmmakerâs sterling ability to wring genius out of rags drenched in stupidity is nowhere to be found in his old buddies Ferrell and Reillyâs latest team-up. While the film isnât nearly half as horrid the marketing has promised, itâs still a wayward circus act that needed a sharp mind like McKayâs to iron out the wrinkles. By the end of âHolmes and Watson,â youâre left with the same sour taste in your mouth you have watching a mid-2000s Adam Sandler flick. What frustrates is that thereâs something here with the premise. Writer/director Etan Cohen (a Mike Judge veteran who directed Ferrell in 2015âs abysmal âGet Hardâ and definitely no Adam McKay) finds a clever port of entry into the Sherlock canon by taking a wry look at what brilliance really meant in Victorian England. It, of course, was a time where medical understanding was paltry, and social diseases like misogyny, racism, and classism ran rampant like the plague. Cohen and company want to slap on a revisionist tint onto the famed literary sleuths, but the results are varied. Itâs kind of funny the first time Reillyâs Dr. Watson offers Ferrellâs Sherlock cocaine casually as if it were a bonbon. The fiftieth time, youâre ready to take a cannonball to the face. The social commentary isnât nearly as acidic as it shouldâve been, either. The message was right, but the vehicle wasnât. So, Armando Iannucci-level satire, this is not. Rather, âHolmes and Watsonâ is a movie that delights in how dumb it is, dallying its stupidity around like someone showing off a fine candle. We all know the pitch for this one at Sony HQ was ââStep Brothersâ with Sherlock Holmesâ but the difference between that Ferrell/Reilly collaboration and this one is McKayâs vision and restraint from the directorâs chair. Rather than be judicious with its jokes, the film takes its stupidest ham hocks of humor and chucks them at a big target mark like someone throwing an endless supply of axes. Sometimes, the ax flies out of range and hits a poor bystander. Other times, the ax blade falls off the handle and lands on your foot. However, if you throw enough axes, youâre going to hit the target at some point. As the deluge of dumbness flows down from Mt. âHolmes and Watson,â erosion eventually takes place. This film works far too hard not to grab you at some point and make you giggle. It dares you not to laugh at Reilly taking an old-timey gun and firing it aimlessly in the air to protect himself from a horde of bees. It begs you not to shamefully smirk at Lauren Lapkusâ character effectively being a person who was raised by feral cats (sheâs splendid with what sheâs given, by the way). It challenges you not to guffaw at the go-for-broke lunacy of watching Ferrell and Reilly attempt to sell the stupidest musical number Alan Menken has ever written (yes, this is a thing). You will cave eventually, you will feel terrible for it, and you will only regret it slightly. But thatâs always been Ferrell and Reillyâs combo shtick. They are the gifted class clowns trying to get you to laugh in the middle of the history exam with the crassest of comedy. This time, though, somethingâs missing. The mess is just a mess, not a place. The ruse lacks in the focused mirth that made it special before. âHolmes and Watsonâ will probably make you smile, and occasionally, it earns that goodwill. But itâs nowhere near where it should be with the company present. Forgive the pun, but itâs elementary to find whatâs off with this movie. Itâs being solved by detectives missing a key clue.",ARB_Doc9_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
149,ARB_Doc10_HolmesAndWatson,"Maybe itâs just the holiday spirit, but I canât find it in myself to be particularly frustrated by Holmes and Watson. Admittedly, itâs no Step Brothers, and I canât help wishing for a more bizarre cut of the film (thereâs an undercurrent of weirdness to the whole affair that feels somehow tempered), but if it feels a little elementary compared to the best of Will Ferrell and John C. Reillyâs work (the aforementioned Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, etc.), thatâs not necessarily a damning distinction. That Ferrell and Reilly should take on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, feels like a logical next step for the comedy duo, as theyâve made something of a specialty out of two-handers featuring Ferrell as the bright star and Reilly as the yearning sidekick. Granted, their particular spin on Arthur Conan Doyleâs most famous creations paints his legendarily brilliant pair as emotionally stunted morons, but the point still stands: Thereâs an archetype that the story fulfills thatâs a perfect match. What makes the film more than a retread, however, is also what makes it so unwieldy. As the detective and doctor work toward foiling an assassination attempt on the Queen (Pam Ferris) by none other than Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), the situations they find themselves in become increasingly bizarre. Part of it is to do with the fact that cracking the case is secondary to cracking open their hearts, and part of it is a seeming indecision as to exactly what Holmes and Watson is meant to be. Halfway between Step Brothers and Talladega Nights. Itâs not quite the absurdist art that Step Brothers is, nor entirely the political commentary of Talladega Nights (a sharper look at the Bush years than this yearâs Vice, with all due apologies to Adam McKay); instead, it falls halfway in between, failing to make a completely coherent meal out of either approach. That said, if I had to wager (with the full acknowledgment that such speculation is meaningless), I would say that director Etan Cohen was trying for something more in line with the former, as there are bizarre interludes scattered throughout that suggest a much stranger film. The best word to describe those moments is âgrotesque,â as the filmâs sense of humor goes beyond the usual scatological jokes â plus the requisite period comedy jabs at modern culture and technological advancements, and some laughs at the expense of previous iterations of Holmes and Watson â and ventures into genuinely strange territory. One scene, doubling down on Watsonâs status as a sidekick rather than an equal, introduces something called the âcompanionsâ room.â The roster of characters introduced there is so strange that their split-second appearance, a far cry from the triter set pieces that populate the rest of the film, is deeply jarring. Another gag spins fun out of the effects of poison, while the filmâs opening sequence alone involves not only turtle rehabilitation but the coining of the term âun-crying.â Itâs that weirdness that makes the filmâs big emotional payoff â which, amazingly, comes courtesy of Alan Menken and Glenn Slater â so fun when it finally kicks in. (The sequence is also shot more inventively than most of the rest of the film, though thatâs neither here nor there.) But it doesnât last long enough, or rather, it comes a little too early in the film out of necessity, as thereâs still a Moriarty mystery to be solved. And yes, Fiennes is largely wasted as Moriarty, but what he does get to do is so patently strange that itâs hard to put out of mind. The same goes for Kelly Macdonald as Mrs. Hudson, absolutely swimming in the river of ham, to the point that you almost forget to wonder what sheâs doing in such a thankless role; Hugh Laurie as Mycroft Holmes, hinting at the glory of his Blackadder days; Rob Brydon as Lestrade, the requisite straight man who seems to have teleported in from another, better movie; and Steve Coogan as a one-armed tattoo artist, who very nearly steals the whole show with an elastic, easy-breezy performance that, naturally, is cut short a little too soon. The worst parts of Holmes and Watson are mitigated by how weird it is, and by its terrific supporting cast. Rebecca Hall and Lauren Lapkus fare a little better in terms of screen time as Holmes and Watsonâs respective love interests, though, ultimately, thereâs not enough space in the movie for anybody but the leading men. If, at times, it all feels like an overextended comedic bit, thatâs because it is. Holmes and Watson is mostly an excuse for Ferrell and Reilly to fool around with British accents (which transcend being good or bad for how hard they lean into how ridiculous they know they sound â they still somehow sound better than a certain lamplighter) and point out how wild the past was (the film has multiple references to casual cocaine use). It doesnât really matter that the case is impossible to solve independently, because itâs not the point of the story, and the filmâs relatively thin construction isnât so severe a crime when the actors can carry most of it off fairly well. Reilly in particular brings a bona fide quality to an otherwise gormless Watson, digging into the sensitivity that served him so well in The Sisters Brothers to what are admittedly diminishing returns. But it still keeps Holmes and Watson from being completely disposable, and the same goes for the whole of the film: Though it doesnât all quite hold together, there are enough inspired moments â and enough strangeness lying just below the filmâs surface â that it doesnât completely fall apart, either.",ARB_Doc10_HolmesAndWatson,ARB,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
30,PYC_Doc1_DirtyGrandpa,"Dirty Grandpa has an 11% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was nominated for five Golden Raspberries and has an almost immaculate attendance record on critics’ worst of the year lists. Those who reviewed it were at pains to point out how filthy they found the experience. Mark Kermode needed a shower, Mike Ryan wanted to burn the prints and Glenn McDonald likened it to torture porn. For some, its chart-topping god-awfulness wasn’t just confined to 2016. Deadline’s Pete Hammond called it not just the worst movie Robert De Niro had been in but “the worst movie anyone has ever been in”. Reader, I liked it. I liked it at the time and, watching it again last night, I liked it even more. It wasn’t just me. Dirty Grandpa’s CinemaScore – which assesses opening night audience reaction on a scale of A (for excellent) to F (for frightful) – is B. That’s worse than Joker (B+) and an improvement on Little Fockers (B-). These are, perhaps, revealing comparisons. For what really condemned Dirty Grandpa in the eyes of the critics was its position at the fag-end of De Niro’s decade horriblis: a prolific run of rubbish dotted with just enough class to remind you of a time before he dropped his trousers. In particular, Dirty Grandpa came in the wake of Last Vegas and The Intern: laughless horror-shows notable only for uncomfortable elderly tumescence. Dirty Grandpa, by contrast, embraces old erections. De Niro’s character has spent 15 chaste years caring for his wife, to whom he was faithful and devoted for 40. Now she’s died, he’s unabashed about trying to seize whatever life is left – particularly if it’s young and female. So he enlists Zac Efron’s uptight lawyer to drive him to Florida for Spring Break, in the hope his hot young grandson will be an effective wingman. But Efron is the opposite – until his drink is spiked, he inhales epic amounts of crack and wakes on a beach naked save for a novelty thong and a swastika of penises drawn on his forehead, before having to FaceTime his parents, fiancee and rabbi. Is that upcoming wedding really a good idea? And was grandpa’s road trip really as self-serving as it seemed? Dan Mazer (a longtime Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator) and his team are firmly on pop’s side. Not only is De Niro an unlikely Jack Reacher, duffing up a gang who dare to threaten a black gay friend, he’s also filthily sage about the perils of sleepwalking into marriage and not sowing your wild oats while you have the chance. De Niro gives it serious welly, grinding and leering, reeling off endless cracked pearls of wisdom, half Larry David, half Sid James. What seemed to some like an Oscar-winner embarrassing himself looks to me a bravely-committed comedic turn. The other performances almost match him. Somewhere along the line, Efron surprise-mutated into one of Hollywood’s best straight men and his evolution here from squeaky-clean law bore to nude batty party fiend – never quite losing the panic in his eyes – is tremendous. Elsewhere, predictable casting is leant on to good effect. Aubrey Plaza, as a college girl who trades amazingly frank banter with De Niro is as winning as she’s ever been, while Jason Mantzoukas does his usual crazed cameo (this time as Pam, a drug-dealing father of six and mayoral candidate) – and does it better than ever. There are problems. Zoey Deutch’s dewy love interest is tedious, Julianne Hough’s pushy fiancee over-emphasised. It’s baggy and unfocused. The extended cut (which is now the most widely available) feels about 400 times too long. Some scenes simply flop – including, sadly, the opening, as well as a climactic “flex-off”. Danny Glover is underused as an army buddy reduced to cross-stitching porn in a care home. Only one in three gags lands – but there are hundreds of them. This is not a film which could have been made today. A slapstick sequence on a beach in which Efron is mistaken for a child molester would, rightly, be first on the cutting room floor. Grandpa’s position when it comes to minorities seems, to put it delicately, confused. But there’s a scattershot approach to sacred cows that can feel even more bracing than it did five years ago. I’ve seen a lot of bad films in my life. Any critic who thinks Dirty Grandpa is a contender for worst film of the year isn’t just lucky, they’re a showboating snob. To fret that farce is beneath an artist betrays an underestimation of what raising a laugh entails. If I had to rewatch this or The Irishman, I know I’d go for the one in which America’s most iconic actor looks like he’s having a stupid amount of fun.",PYC_Doc1_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
31,PYC_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,"You're probably not going to read the whole thing after that title, but there I said it. I love this movie. I thought I wasn't going to like it once I watched it again, but I did and I liked it even more. The movie is slandered by critics and is known to be immature and grotesque. But to me, I think it has a much deeper meaning. It starts off with Zac Efron going to see his De Niro after his grandmother died. We see De Niro jacking off in a tissue when Zac Efron walks in. From the start, we learn everything there is to know about De Niro's character. He's an aging man that will do anything hedonistic so that he can forget. Any sort of pleasure there is, he'll track it and take it. We see that Zac Efron is clearly not happy with being a lawyer. He's forced to do this by his dad and his fiancé does not give a shit about him. Noone respects him, and neither does his aging grandpa, who sees him as weak and shrill. Another huge irony of the movie to me. Zac Efron is weak and shrill but is lean and jacked. I don't know if this was done on purpose by the director, but it's smart casting to me. Even the first time I watched the movie, I always thought that Deniro just didn't want to remember that he was a grandpa. The retirement home scene with Danny Glover was the saddest and funniest scene to me. He looks at Danny Glover and smiles when he's clowning Zack Efron, but at the same time he's distraught that his friend is in the home and knows he might even be there soon. The whole monologue about him just wanting to fuck explains a lot. To him, Danny Glover is basically purgatory (exaggeration, I know.) I also liked Zac Efron's character. I sympathized with him knowing that he doesn't want to be lawyer and wants to be a photographer instead. Admit it, we've all had parents who has forced us into jobs we don't like. Including me. The more I think of it, Zac Efron's character is more tragic. If he ends up a lawyer he'd be like his douchey dad, and if he goes with the college girl(which I don't think is gonna last), he might end up like his dickhead grandpa. At the end, Deniro loses himself to Aubrey Plaza. We see in the end credits that they have a baby together. On the first viewing, I thought that joke was flat and didn't land. But now I think that he probably wanted to have a child because both Zac Efron and his son(Zac Efron's dad) have disappointed him in life. Perhaps this child of his won't disappoint him. He can mold the child to something he's proud of. And then he's off floating with his dead wife somewhere or being strolled in a wheelchair by Aubrey Plaza to his purgatory with Danny Glover. Or maybe this movie wasn't so hot at all. This movie was targeted for 17 year old's like me, so I'm sure it's just some filler comedy at the end of the day. Who knows, 10 years I might watch this film again and not bring myself to watch it. Or perhaps I'd like still. Zac Efron should do more comedies. He was seriously great in Neighbors. Edit: I'm fine with anyone disagreeing with my review. Downvote all you want. But it would be nice if someone was to talk about why they disagree. Isn't this sub about a civil conversation on films? Also, I don't know if this is the moderators or not, but can the comments that are talking about the film show? Because there are two comments already.",PYC_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
32,PYC_Doc3_DirtyGrandpa,"2016's Dirty Grandpa was certainly a divisive movie, with some people finding this comedy utterly hilarious, and others thinking that this was one of the worst movies ever made. It's truly like marmite, you either love it, or you hate it, there doesn't tend to be much middle ground for this. Even though Dirty Grandpa is very over the top, at its core, there are a few interesting moral lessons that make it interesting to watch. Showcasing that life can still continue after loss, even at an old age, and that family togetherness is crucial. These key lessons of being able to let go and not allow work to dominate a life all come together to create a compelling storyline. Because there are distinct lessons to learn here, it allows audiences to connect to the story on a deeper level, which does make this movie quite enjoyable at points and is why it's underrated as it isn't all just silly humor. There is very little to really sink your teeth into when it comes to Dirty Grandpa. The film relies heavily upon its audience loving Robert De Niro in this wild role, and if that isn't the case then there's very little to enjoy here. The plot of him wanting to have sex, literally the day after his wife passes away is a little far fetched, meanwhile, Zac Efron's character is busy battling the idea of whether or not he wants to get married. It's a very weak and at times far fetched plot that is impossible to really get stuck in with. While there have been several movies showcasing elderly characters letting loose in recent years, this style of film s very much unique. Normally, characters going crazy with drinking and wanting to sleep with different women feature several young actors, and that is what makes this film unique. Dirty Grandpa flips that traditional idea on its head by having Robert De Niro take on that role, which is a lot of fun. It's something that makes the movie standout on its own, and that is why it's underrated because its plot is actually fairly unique. Zac Efron and Robert De Niro take up the two lead roles within this movie as the grandfather/grandson duo and the film really does rely upon the two of them working together well as actors. While they're not putting in incredible, Oscar-worthy performances, there's no denying that they have good chemistry together on-screen. Even though the plot might be ridiculous at times and the dialogue isn't exactly compelling, the two of them do have great energy together. They form a believable bond on-screen that really helps to convey the relationship they're trying to get across, which does deserve some credit. For a movie that had a production budget of $25 million, the fact that Dirty Grandpa went on to gross just over $105 million at the box office would suggest that this movie was a real hit. Sure, the critics might have panned it, but people flocked to the cinema to watch it. Whether it was because of good advertising, the big names, or people wanting to see if it was a real car crash of a film, audiences paid to see it. In terms of financial success, this comedy certainly did very well and that is something that does go under the radar. While there are some utterly ridiculous moments in this movie, there are some hidden gems that are absolutely hilarious sprinkled in. After all, this is a comedy and it would be pretty poor if there weren't any moments that made people laugh through its whole story. Thankfully, the movie does have some very funny moments, whether it is Zac Efron's drug scene, which creates some over the top humor or the two lead characters taking part in a 'Flex-Off,' there are some genuinely funny parts.",PYC_Doc3_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
33,PYC_Doc4_DirtyGrandpa,"Okay, I know what you all may be thinking, Dirty Grandpa, the newest comedy featuring Robert “Refusing To Take A Pay-Cut” De Niro is just another sad excuse of a comedy featuring a world-class veteran actor whose acting days are numbered and career is slowly fading? Actually, the fact of the matter is, Dirty Grandpa is a very funny, very over-the-top, very rambunctious comedy with nothing but entertainment value, laughs and some good old-fashioned Hollywood fun at the movies, poking redeem fun at itself following the heavy and highly melodramatic Oscar burdened December month. I can think of so many other disappointing January films that I’ve seen in the past, that quickly make way onto my list of Worst Films of the year. Luckily for Dick Kelly (De Niro) and his lawyer loving grandson Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), the two won’t be making their way to that list. Filled with deadpan dirty talk, highly sexualize jokes, crude, rude and obnoxious taboo social references, Dirty Grandpa becomes one wild and dirty-minded fun filled trip to start off 2016. Not that the film should be a reflection of the film caliber of 2016, but Dirty Grandpa never becomes a film that falls and cannot get back up. Instead, the first comedy of 2016 tells the similar story to Pixar’s Up; but instead of the adorable Carl Fredricksen taking a wild trip on his hot-air balloon, Dick Kelly decides that, after a fifteen years abstinence, and with the loving approval of his dying wife, the secret ex-Military man decides to trick his favourite grandson along for a ride to Daytona Beach to find some horny and foul-mouth twenty somethings in a pink Mini Cooper. Kind of the same thing, right? What begins as a simple guys trip with golfing, dining and some male bonding, quickly turns into a wild weekend looking for answers for both men; sensory for Dick, and emotionally for Jason, who is unsure about his marriage to the all too perfect and tremendously overbearing Meredith Goldstein (Julianne Hough), who ultimately becomes the sexiest Bridezilla we have seen on film in a while. Luckily for our unlikely duo, answers quickly come, in the form of Lenore (Aubrey Plaza); a wild mouth lascivious college girl looking to bone a senior for the sake of completing a life long list of hers; and Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a free-spirited, organic loving, tree-hugging hipster who is the complete opposite of Jason’s Meredith. With the girls off to Daytona Beach, Dick begs his grandson Jason to pursue them, knowing that Dick is surely going to be able fulfill his dreams of sleeping with a college student. Luckily for the audience, the wildly uncalled for sexual banter between the doe-eyed Plaza and De Niro is what we look forward to the most, making their dialogue the highlight of the film overall. I mean, how funny is it hearing De Niro shout out things like, “Party ’till your pregnant!”, or “I got news for you. That’s the only thing that's going to be pulling out tonight.”(speaking about a pull-out couch). While the trip to Daytona Beach is anything but smooth, the duo encounter a slew of college obstacles that get in the way of their overall goals of bedding the girls of their dreams; from wild crack smoking Macarena drug-induced trips, to chugging contests, to “Flex-Offs” against dim-witted college jocks Cody and Brah (Jake Picking and Michael Hudson), acting as the duo’s main nemesis throughout the film, Dirty Grandpa is one downright messy, and we love it. Director Dan Mazer, the man behind writing comedy classic Borat and of course the highly bloated sequel-ish Brüno shortly after, does a decent job of delivering the laughs with a cast that could carry any movie and its comedic material any day of the week. Luckily for Mazer, Dirty Grandpa won’t be a critical hit by any means, but commercially, with a mere $11.5 million dollar budget, the film will likely make a decent marginal profit for the director. Its rude, its offensive and most of all, the social satire here is totally tasteless, although it is really funny seeing an elderly De Niro asking a group of black street thugs permission of using the derogatory ‘N’ word while singing Ice Cube’s “It Was A Good Day” in a Karaoke bar with his newly made ‘homies’. Plus, when is a raunchy comedy not offensive? Obviously, if the film and its main sh*t disturbing protagonist isn’t raising a few eyebrows, something is wrong. De Niro is Hollywood royalty and can basically do whatever he wants with little to almost no repercussions at this point in his career.",PYC_Doc4_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
34,PYC_Doc5_DirtyGrandpa,"My hopes were high for “Dirty Grandpa,” simply because its mere existence made no practical sense. A movie starring Robert De Niro and Zac Efron doesn’t sound like a real movie. It sounds like a fake movie you’d see clips of in a film that’s mocking the stupidity of Hollywood. For all intents and purposes, “Dirty Grandpa” should only exist in the form of one of the fake trailers that open “Tropic Thunder.” And yet, here it is. All 102 minutes of it. Before watching this, my mind raced with all of the stupid possibilities. How many Viagra jokes would there be? Would somebody ask De Niro about his Viagra induced boner and have De Niro respond, “Are you talking to me?” shortly before one of the grips runs onto the set to give him a high five? Would there be a scene in which a dog wins a farting contest after it farts so hard it launches itself inside of the bare, gaping ass of its competitor: a cameo by Harvey Keitel (who, it’s implied, accidentally overdosed on Viagra)? Unfortunately, these moments were not to be – outside of my Pinterest page and/or dream board. But luckily, what we got was equally stupid. Maybe even a little more so. As you may have already guessed, “Dirty Grandpa” is as terrible as its derivative title implies. But “Dirty Grandpa” is also the kind of terrible I can embrace and appreciate. It’s bad but in a way that might be intentional. Ten minutes into the film we’re greeted with the sight of a nude, 72-year-old De Niro graphically masturbating to a porno movie. Was this grotesque gag supposed to make us laugh? Or was it an attempt at Tim & Eric-style anti-comedy? It’s hard to say. But considering that “Dirty Grandpa” was directed by former “Da Ali G Show” scribe Dan Mazer, it could possibly be the latter. “Dirty Grandpa” is an extremely low stakes road comedy with a plotline so tossed-off and vaguely defined that it makes the aimless, improvisatory “Bad Grandpa” look nuanced and densely plotted. In the movie, De Niro plays a dick joke that walks like a man (almost literally. His character’s name is Dick Kelly for Christ’s sake) who gently coerces his uptight grandson (Efron) into driving him down to Boca Raton. Ostensibly, it’s because the recently widowed De Niro wants to reconnect with an old army buddy, but in reality it’s because he totally wants to ‘get it wet’ and help his buzzkill of a grandson to break free from his future ball and chain (The very Nordic Julianne Hough inexplicably cast as an offensive Jewish American Princess stereotype) and his domineering father (Dermot Mulroney). And then – well, that’s pretty much it. But who cares about story when you have De Niro croaking out a cover of Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day” or screaming labored, improvised insults like “Cocky McBlockerson” into Efron’s unfeeling, porcelain face (he basically looks like the doll from “The Boy” if it was 60 percent abs)? Some critics have defended De Niro’s late period career choices by noting the “realities of remaining a working actor into old age” without acknowledging that De Niro really doesn’t need to be a working actor anymore. He could have pulled a Jimmy Cagney and comfortably retired as a respected private citizen instead of now being known as the guy who played the guy who screamed about what it would be like to have Queen Latifah defecate in his mouth from a hot air balloon. But it’s exactly this sort of schadenfreude that makes “Dirty Grandpa” so seductive. Seeing the star of “Mean Streets” and (sadly) “The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle” play a less funny, more racist version of Danny DeVito’s character from “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” is something that must be seen and cherished. Additionally, “Dirty Grandpa” is so stupid and gleefully filthy that you’ll find yourself laughing in spite of yourself. Danny Glover cameos as an infirmed old man who gets a little too excited by a violent episode of “Alf.” Aubrey Plaza blows a bong hit into De Niro’s mouth shortly after he nearly kills a kid with a T-Shirt gun. Jason Mantzoukas and Henry Zebrowski play a pair of unrepentant but cheerful Florida scumbags. “Dirty Grandpa” is so ill-advised, incompetently made and singularly weird that it must be seen at least once. After all, De Niro has nowhere else to go but up at this point. Enjoy rock bottom while it lasts.",PYC_Doc5_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
35,PYC_Doc6_DirtyGrandpa,"Make no mistake about it, Robert De Niro is a bona fide legend. But also make no mistake that his latest film, Dirty Grandpa, is not just the worst movie he has ever been in, but it may be the worst movie anyone has ever been in. As I say in my video review, this movie is so stupefyingly awful it is almost impossible to imagine what could have attracted star Zac Efron, and especially De Niro, to want to wade through this mess, or in fact for distributor Lionsgate to want to make it in the first place. That company certainly doesn’t seem to want to show it as they wisely didn’t make Dirty Grandpa available for critics in advance of Thursday night’s opening previews, where I caught it. The word of mouth on this steaming pile will be disastrous. The film’s plot (what there is of it) centers on an uptight young lawyer, Jason (Efron), who is about to be married to a wedding-obsessed fiancee (a one-note Julianne Hough). But he is tricked by his lecherous grandfather (De Niro) into taking him on a trip to Florida after gramp’s wife of 40 years dies. The real purpose of the trip is for Grandpa to get to Daytona Beach where some wild Spring Break action is taking place and he can get his rocks off with some bikini-clad college-age girls. You know you are in big trouble almost from the first tasteless moments at the wife’s funeral and a follow-up scene where De Niro (whose character’s name is Dick, of course) is pleasuring himself while watching porn while waiting for Jason to pick him up. Things go way downhill from there in a movie that tries for the gross-out humor of stuff like The Hangover but makes that film look like high art by comparison. People are already confusing it with Johnny Knoxville’s Bad Grandpa, but that movie is 12 Years A Slave compared to this. Rarely have I seen a motion picture  — and I have seen them all — that wallows so unashamedly in homophobic, racist, misogynist, so-called humor. Its “jokes” are aimed at just about everyone with any kind of disability — and even one you-have-to-see-it-to believe-it-scene with a naked Efron being caught in an act of mistaken child molestation. Hilarious, right? We are only three weeks into 2016, but what can compete with this for dud of the year? Maybe all of this could be OK with some forgiving audiences if any of it was funny, but the laughs here are few and far between — almost non-existent. I sat with my mouth open, astonished at watching accomplished actors (who hopefully will wipe this thing from their IMDb page immediately) flailing about for laughs that never come. It’s embarrassing to see thesps the caliber of Danny Glover and Dermot Mulroney thoroughly humiliated, no matter how small their roles may be. Mulroney, in fact, spends most of his screen time with penises painted all over his face, which is at least not as bad as what Efron has to endure in a couple of scenes where his forehead is plastered with a Nazi Swastika also designed with male members. I can’t make this stuff up, folks.",PYC_Doc6_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
36,PYC_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,"This is a very disturbing and difficult movie to watch. Someday, scholars will teach classes, warning them of what can happen when evil wins. When we watch the scene when Zac Efron’s Jason Kelly wakes up on the beach, wrecked after a night of smoking crack, only wearing a thong with a big stuffed bee attached, it’s tragic enough. But then when a small child wants to play with the bee and that child’s father thinks the child is performing a lewd sexual act on Efron, it makes us want to stop the movie, remove it from its projector, and throw it in the river. Then we light that river ablaze in all its glory. But that’s the easy way out. This film needs to be studied so that what’s depicted here can never, ever happen again. Efron is supposed to have buddy chemistry with De Niro, but the only sparks in the movie come from De Niro’s flirtation with Aubrey Plaza. More than anyone else in the cast, Plaza embraces the fact that she’s playing a ridiculous construct issuing filthy, sometimes absurdist one-liners and rejoinders — a non-character who might as well disappear in a puff of smoke every time she’s out of frame. Plaza’s seeming contempt for the project energizes her performance, and her scene partner; she and De Niro appear ready to run away together into a better movie. Apart from Plaza, the movie is funniest when portraying Florida as a lawless dirtbag playground. This is only a minor thread, though; the filmmakers seem more eager to give Dick permission to gay-bash and use racial slurs through a series of mostly inexplicable and unfunny plot turns. While Mazer and Phillips focus on these convolutions, the movie’s stupid mistakes pile up. Some are minor but persistent, like the way photography enthusiasts Jason and Shadia speak reverently of “Time” magazine when it seems like they actually mean “Life.” Others are more distracting, like a weird, sloppy time compression that has heavy wedding planning, an actual wedding, spring break, and college graduation all taking place within a single week in March. All of the worst bits — a cartoonishly villainous fiancée, Jason’s clumsily developed interest in photography, Dick’s apparent invincibility — come together for an insanely drawn-out wedding-disruption scene so agonizingly long and terribly blocked that it almost works as experimental parody. That incompetence combined with the occasional burst of disreputable laughter makes “Dirty Grandpa” oddly lively for a movie that’s largely terrible. The ultimate message, of course, is supposed to be that Jason just has to loosen up to realize he needs to lose the soulless job and shrew fiancee and discover his real destiny, while Dick gets his late-life dreams fulfilled by a drunk twentysomething with daddy issues. Some of the cameos (like Jason Mantzoukas as a giddily amoral drug dealer and Adam Pally as Jason’s stoned, cornrowed cousin) are intermittently amusing. (Danny Glover, completely wasted as Dick’s old army buddy, not so much.) And a few of the jokes really are funny. Mostly though they’re just dumb: broad, crass, and depressingly repetitive. You’ll get to see Efron’s butt a lot, if that’s what you came for; it’s real, and it’s spectacular, even if the script’s endless jokes about him looking like a lesbian are not. There could have been something sort of scamp-ish and charming about all this — two generations brought together to learn from each other and bond and maybe have some PG-13 fun. Instead, “Dirty Grandpa” feels like spending 100-plus minutes with a scatalogical toddler, proudly showing you what he made in his diaper. Don’t look if you don’t have to.",PYC_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
37,PYC_Doc8_DirtyGrandpa,"On Jan. 22, “Dirty Grandpa” was unleashed on the unsuspecting American public. The purpose behind the movie is dubious. Historians and scholars will debate it for years to come. But here is what stands obvious and unrelentingly true: “Dirty Grandpa” is a travesty and a punishment for everybody who watches it. The film stars Zac Efron, who was likely forced into it after losing the worst poker bet of all time. He plays Jason Kelly, a lawyer without much cause or reason to his life besides his fiancee Meredith (Julianne Hough). Meredith is a loud, senseless, arrogant woman, perhaps the single most arrogant fictional character ever conceived. At the funeral for Jason’s grandmother, Meredith, without a second thought, interrogates him about wedding plans. Poor Jason. Next comes multi-Academy Award winner Robert De Niro as Richard “Dick” Kelly, which is hopefully neither a knock to director Richard Kelly or singer R. Kelly, both of whom did nothing to deserve association with this picture. Within the first instances of De Niro appearing on screen, he leans back in a recliner chair and masturbates. Poor Robert De Niro.At this point I expect most audience members to have left the theater, or alternatively lost their grasp of reality. Dick, worried about his own impending death, pleads for Jason to take him on a spring break getaway to Florida. It is in the Sunshine State that the movie turns from disappointing to outright distressing and disturbing. In discussing the movie I must set aside for a brief moment the horrendous amount of politically incorrect “jokes” made about everything from rape to disability to the LGBT community. I must set aside that, bafflingly, “Dirty Grandpa” is branded as a comedy, when in reality there isn’t a single laugh to be found. I have to look deeper. I have to look at a moment where Jason, after having smoked a baffling amount of crack the night before, wakes up with a bottle of vodka stuck inside his rectum, wearing only a small thong with a large plush bee attached to his crotch area. A small child comes to Jason and begins playing with the bee, resulting in the boy’s father coming over to scold Jason. Poor Zac Efron. By no means does “Dirty Grandpa” have any sort of pleasing resolution. After an hour and a half of countless lewd acts, the film tries to go for a quaint, fairy-tale solution. In reality, it comes off as ridiculous, a somehow mistaken shift in tone for a movie that had nothing resembling a comfortable tone to begin with. “Dirty Grandpa” could, someday, be a landmark film. To many, it will probably be in discussion as the worst film ever made. But even then, “Dirty Grandpa” was crudely made on purpose with an offensiveness that, in the changing social landscape, may never be possible again. It’s difficult conceiving that a movie at any point in the future will try to best its atrocity. American filmmaking may have just reached its lowest point.",PYC_Doc8_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
38,PYC_Doc9_DirtyGrandpa,"Humor, it must be acknowledged, is entirely subjective. What some people find hilarious, others find rude, even offensive. Indeed, it’s entirely possible that … wait, never mind. Forget all that. It can be definitively stated that Dirty Grandpa is utterly unfunny. Or, you could say it’s as funny as child molestation, a subject which, incidentally, inspires one of its least tasteful gags. It’s hard to know which is the saddest moment of this purported comedy starring Robert De Niro and Zac Efron. Is it the spectacle of the two-time Academy Award winner masturbating to porn as a sight gag? His shirtless “flex off” with Efron? His karaoke rapping? Or his character’s nostalgic remembrance about his late wife that “we also tried anal every five years.” or those who care, the plot involves the title character, aptly named Dick (De Niro), recruiting his straight-laced, uptight lawyer grandson Jason (Efron) to drive him from Atlanta to Boca Raton after the death of his wife of four decades. Jason is at first resistant, since he works for his father’s (Dermot Mulroney) firm and is due to get married the next week to the neurotically controlling Meredith (Julianne Hough). But he reluctantly agrees, driving his fiancée’s pink car, which his grandfather alternately refers to as a “giant labia,” a “giant tampon” and a “dildomobile.”   Although he initially appears to be a suitably grieving widower, Grandpa soon is revealed as a randy horndog whose sole goal is to get laid. And it looks like he’s going to get his wish when, during a stop at a roadside diner, they meet up with three college students on their way to Daytona Beach: Shadia (Zoey Deutch), Jason’s former high school classmate who shared his now-abandoned passion for photography; Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), who sees Dick as the fulfillment of her goal to sleep with a university student, alumni and professor (he’s conned her into thinking he’s the last); and Bradley (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman), a gay African-American who becomes the target of Dick’s running insults. After stopping briefly to see Dick’s old army buddy (Danny Glover, who’s also humiliated), Jason and his grandfather wind up in Daytona Beach to hook up with the threesome, with an obvious romantic attraction developing between Jason and the artistic Shadia. Before you know it, Jason lets his freak flag fly, inadvertently smoking crack and winding up on a beach naked save for a plush toy on his genitals, with penises shaped in the form of a swastika drawn on his face (cue the embarrassing FaceTime call with his fiancée and her elderly rabbi). Among the other repellent characters unfortunately at hand are Pam (Jason Mantzoukas), a zany beach store proprietor/drug dealer; Jason’s cousin Nick (Adam Pally), whose picture would show up in the dictionary under “Political Incorrectness”. Screenwriter John M. Phillip (usually, comedies this bad are written by a team) thinks it’s the height of hilarity to have the characters swear as often as possible, with De Niro uttering the F-word more times here than in his entire collaboration with Martin Scorsese. He also says the N-word, although not before politely asking his new friends, a group of black toughs who he had previously beaten to a pulp, if it’s ok. (If you’re wondering about that last part, it has to do with a revelation about De Niro’s character that won’t be revealed here; let’s just say that he possesses a very particular set of skills.) Efron, obviously thrilled to be working with an acting legend, throws himself into the physical comedy with game enthusiasm. But his penchant for constantly exposing his ultra-buff body, as if he’s chagrined that he’s never appeared in a Magic Mike movie, is wearing a bit thin. It’s all directed as crudely as possible by Dan Mazer, who somehow came to think that this inane material was on a par with that of his frequent collaborator, Sacha Baron Cohen. Far worse, Dirty Grandpa doesn’t even have the courage of its anarchic convictions, frequently abandoning its tasteless humor to indulge in sentimental scenes in which the characters pour out their hearts to the accompaniment of a treacly music score.",PYC_Doc9_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
39,PYC_Doc10_DirtyGrandpa,"When Robert De Niro receives his inevitable lifetime achievement Oscar, don’t expect his highlight reel to include a single clip from “Dirty Grandpa,” a brutally unfunny stab at ribald comedy that stands as the legendary actor’s big-screen nadir. Spouting an endless stream of profane one-liners, each of them more desperate to shock and offend than the last, De Niro gives it his best raunchy effort as a senior citizen who convinces his stuck-up preppy grandson (Zac Efron) to take him to Florida. His commitment to the role, however, is far more than it — or the film — deserves, as its sub-“Hangover” juvenilia is almost as excruciating as its basic construction is sloppy. While its cross-generational leads may attract a few curious moviegoers hungry for some humor, dreary word-of-mouth will likely force this fiasco into early theatrical retirement. On the day of his wife’s funeral, Dick (De Niro) guilt-trips his grandson Jason (Efron) into helping him honor his late spouse by taking the same journey from Georgia to Boca Raton that they made each year. Though his wedding to prim Meredith (Julianne Hough) is fast approaching, Jason — a corporate lawyer who works for his dad, David (Dermot Mulroney) — reluctantly agrees to this task, only to just about throw up on one of his many polo shirt-and-khaki outfits when he goes to pick up Dick and finds the man pleasuring himself to porn, and casually referring to his climax as “a No. 3.” Traveling in Meredith’s pink Mini Cooper, which Dick derisively refers to as a “giant labia,” the duo first stop at a golf course, where Dick begins his film-long habit of poking Jason in the ass with objects and/or his finger, all while espousing his consuming need for coitus. That objective is articulated in terms too filthy to repeat in a respectable publication such as this, though the film’s incessant verbal diarrhea is less shocking than merely embarrassing. Constantly deriding Jason as a “lesbian” and bombarding him with pun-based invectives about his lousy performance as a “wingman,” Dick is over-the-top inappropriate in a way that feels hopelessly strained, as if every one of his lines had been diligently crafted by screenwriter John Phillips for maximum oh-no-he-didn’t! effect. Because he hasn’t had sex in 15 years, and because his dying wife told him to pursue the life he always wanted, Dick is determined to bed a young woman — and he finds that object of carnal desire in Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), a college sexpot whose mouth is almost as filthy as that of De Niro’s hot-to-trot elder. In order to shack up with Lenore, Dick forces a reluctant Jason to take him to Daytona Beach for spring break. Because Lenore is traveling with Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a hot hippie former classmate of Jason’s, the young dork agrees, although Efron seems so perpetually bored by these sensationalistic shenanigans that it’s difficult to tell if he’s even paying attention to the narrative’s who-what-where-when-whys. What ensues is much X-rated banter between Dick and Lenore, multiple run-ins with a gleefully frank drug dealer named Pam (Jason Mantzoukas) who’s friends with the local cops, and a series of sequences in which Jason is compelled — by Dick, by circumstance, and by illicit substances — to loosen up and have a good time. This means he smokes crack and wears a G-string and a hornet-shaped stuffed animal on his crotch (thus fulfilling Efron’s one-shirtless-scene-per-movie quota), spends a night in jail for alleged pedophilia, and has to talk to his fiance, his family and a rabbi via Facetime while sporting, on his forehead, a crudely drawn swastika made out of penises. Amid its nonstop nastiness, Phillips’ script feigns interest in character development, with Jason’s discarded dreams of being a Time magazine photographer revived by Dick’s and Shadia’s encouragement, and Dick’s career as a special-forces badass revealed as the reason for his estrangement from son David. The idea that an overseas-stationed Green Beret would act as belligerently low-class as Dick is tough to swallow, though even less palatable is the movie’s aesthetic crumminess. Director Dan Mazer shoots his Sunshine State-situated action in the flattest manner possible, and he edits his material — including De Niro performing an abysmal karaoke version of Ice Cube’s “It Was A Good Day,” punctuated by his use of the “N” word — with such rushed, herky-jerky awkwardness that it often feels as if the film is actively trying to escape itself. As befitting such a guy-centric endeavor, women are presented as either chaste angels (Shadia), uninhibited sluts (Lenore) or soul-crushing spousal monsters (Meredith), Meanwhile, Dick’s recurring gay-panic jabs at Jason, as well as his cruel treatment of effeminate Bradley (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman), further emphasizes the sense that “Dirty Grandpa” only respects, or has use for, straight Caucasian men of a certain take-what-they-want caveman variety. After repeatedly belittling Bradley for being both gay and black, Dick heroically rescues him from homophobic bullies — an act meant to illustrate that, deep down, this dirty old man is really a good guy. What it actually indicates, however, is that this contemptible fiasco is not only comfortable courting laughs through ugly mockery of minorities, but also doesn’t even have the courage of its own crass-as-I-wannabe convictions.",PYC_Doc10_DirtyGrandpa,PYC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
120,SDT_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,"Now he’s come to the end of his run, Daniel Craig’s James Bond will be remembered as the first – and possibly only – 007 to grieve so intensely and for so long over a woman. Back in the beginning, the idea of Sean Connery doing such a thing would have been unthinkable but Craig’s Bond has spent his past four films brooding about his lost love, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), killed at the end of Casino Royale. This air of seriousness has carried certain risks. With his long upper lip and reluctance to crack a smile, he could have made his mark as the only grumpy Bond, but the pulsing intelligence behind the gloom has transformed it into gravitas without slowing down his performance. When Ian Fleming and John le Carre began writing in the 1950s and ’60s, their books sat at spy fiction’s opposite poles. Le Carre was interested in moral ambiguities while Fleming was about glamour, gadgetry and the god-like qualities of a certain breed of debonair Englishman. As Britain’s geopolitical powers declined, Fleming grew a little more reflective but the Bond movies stayed on the lighter side of his imaginings. It wasn’t until Craig slipped into the tuxedo and the Aston Martin that the mood changed. His Bond has been distinguished by his misgivings. And the series has adjusted its attitude to women to suit the contemporary mood. For a while, the old ruthlessness clung on. Gemma Arterton was allowed only a token appearance as one of his conquests in Quantum of Solace before coming to a sudden sticky end by being drowned in crude oil but in No Time to Die, Craig’s fifth and final outing, the three women who share his adventures can look after themselves. When we pick him up at the start of this film, he’s still with his new love, Lea Seydoux’s Madeleine Swann. He’s retired from the service and they’re holidaying in a mountain town in southern Italy. It’s here that Vesper Lynd is buried and he has decided to make peace with his memories by visiting her grave. But peace is hard to come by in a Bond movie and the visit turns into yet another fight for his life. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga maintains the scale and pace of the stunts, which propel the plot halfway around the world. From Italy we move to Jamaica where Bond is introduced to the new 007 – a woman. Played by Britain’s Lashana Lynch, who is of Jamaican descent, she has a feisty disposition and a need to know exactly what Bond and his old friend, the CIA agent, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) are up to. Naturally, he’s not going to tell her. For one thing, he’s too busy dealing with another gang of thugs who are out for his blood. He has been assigned CIA help, however. Paloma (Cuban actress Ana de Armas), his CIA colleague, is such an expert in martial arts that she dispatches several villains without losing control of the evening dress she’s barely wearing. Old friends and enemies re-appear. We get a glimpse of Q (Ben Wishaw) at home, where he is revealed as a cat-lover, and Bond and Ralph Fiennes’ M get plenty of opportunities to express their icy disdain for one another. The series’ evil masterminds always come with a potent touch of the bizarre, and Rami Malek’s Safin is one of the creepiest. Wild-eyed but soft-spoken as if trying to persuade himself, along with everyone else, that he’s the only sane person in the room, he’s scarred from a childhood encounter with a biological poison. Out for revenge, he has built himself a concrete fortress on an island in the north Atlantic. It’s here, in its underground maze of corridors, tunnels and vast spaces that the film’s climax takes place. It goes without saying that the future of humanity is at stake. Craig has certainly taken Bond into deeper waters than ever before, putting him in touch with the zeitgeist, but along the way something important has gone missing. His best scene is still the one on the train in Casino Royale where he meets Lynd for the first time. It points to what might have been had he gone on nurturing his sense of humour.",SDT_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Positive,No Time To Die
121,SDT_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,"If there’s one consistency in the Daniel Craig James Bond era, it’s inconsistency. From the franchise high of Casino Royale to the witless Blofeld introduction in Spectre, the Craig era has disappointed as much as it has thrilled. But in an almost-60-year-old franchise with now 25 entries, there’s bound to be some missteps, and at least none of the Craig movies featured a glowing dream machine or a lovesick Jaws. The more striking consistency about the Craig era is a commitment to Bond’s emotional arc, suggesting that not only does the British super spy have a heart, but that the pain he experienced in one movie actually marks him in the next. So, it’s fitting that No Time To Die, Craig’s fifth and final outing, is a mix of both these distinctions, the emotional connection audiences have to a Bond that dared to feel, while frustrated at certain story and character choices. No Time To Die is, on balance, a kinetic, expansive and stirring capstone to Craig’s adventures in those perfectly tailored Tom Ford suits. It’s a quirk of this particular Bond epoch that they actually require you to have seen the everything since Casino Royale (except maybe Quantum of Solace) to make full sense of No Time To Die – you could dip in, but you’d have a lot of questions. But that does mean that a lot of the character beats in No Time To Die lands better – a punchier ending to Craig’s 15-year tenure than any of his predecessors got – than if the franchise continued its laissez-faire attitude to Bond’s emotional state. And his emotional state is at the heart of everything in No Time To Die, a film that picks up not long after the ending of Spectre, with he and Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) driving off in his Aston Martin DB5 and winding along the coast of southern Italy. Bond fans who appreciate the unfairly maligned On Her Majesty’s Secret Service will immediately pick up a line of dialogue Bond says to Madeleine, “We have all the time in the world”. That direct connection between OHMSS – the only pre-Craig movie in which Bond actually falls in love – and No Time To Die foreshadows the world the film swims in, one in which Bond is not a super spy but a fallible human that has been broken, whose vulnerabilities are numerous. Craig has the range and skill to pull it off, and he’s more present here than in Spectre. But the weakness of No Time To Die and Spectre is that Craig and Seydoux’s chemistry doesn’t spark, and it’s a risk hanging the film’s emotional centre on a pairing whose grand romance you can’t buy into. Part of that is since Casino Royale, the Bond movies have tried to recreate the crackling chemistry between Craig and Eva Green whose first tete-a-tete on the train to Montenegro is more sexual than anything in 25 Bond movies – and no one even took their clothes off. Compared to that, it’s hard to invest in the ones that came after (though Monica Belluci came close in Spectre), no matter how smouldering the eye contact is. Albeit Craig’s reunion with Knives Out co-star Ana de Armas in a Cuba-set sequence is the film’s most fun and that’s largely down to their collective charm. It’s not necessarily a sexual energy but they certainly, at least, feel like equals in the scene. No Time To Die’s plot is nothing too exciting, a typical Bond/Mission Impossible/Fast & Furious contrivance, in which the villainous Safin (Rami Malek) is threatening the world with a weapon so fearsome that the only option is to stop him. Safin is a ludicrous villain whose main characteristic seems to be whispering with menace. He professes a personal motivation, but the script decides midway through the film to pivot that to genocide. Malek has displayed so much intensity in previous roles including in Mr Robot, but none of that is on show here. Usually in these types of movies, there’s a device or file that serves as the MacGuffin to motivate the characters and move the story along and in No Time To Die, that’s Safin, whose presence barely registers as anything more than how to get Bond to the next scene. Most of Bond’s previous collaborators including Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Ben Whishaw and Jeffrey Wright are under-utilised but Lashana Lynch’s new agent sizzles and optimistically points to where the franchise could go next. Director Cary Fukunaga handles the requisite action sequences with panache and dynamism, which is immensely helpful for a movie that clocks in at two hours and 40 minutes, because you don’t really feel the long runtime. Bond isn’t known as a franchise that’s cultivated high-profile filmmakers given no director’s reputation will ever supersede Bond’s brand, and while Fukunaga mostly functions as the current steward in a larger machine, there are instances in which certain shots in No Time To Die look like they have the aesthetic mark of the American filmmaker’s visual style. If anything, what Fukunaga and screenwriters Neal Pervis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fukunaga also has a “story by” credit) have managed is to really keep fidelity with Bond’s emotional arc. It’s the strength of the series. Even if you don’t buy into Bond and Madeleine’s endgame romance, you do buy into Bond’s journey – and it’s one you’ll want to see out with Craig as the grittiest, most grounded and most exposed Bond in 59 years. You may even get a little emotional.",SDT_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Positive,No Time To Die
122,SDT_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,"James Bond has saved the world two dozen times during the last half-century, but the stakes have never been higher than they are in Cary Joji Fukunaga’s long-awaited (and even longer-delayed) “No Time to Die.” This mega-blockbuster is saddled with the extraordinary pressure of salvaging the Daniel Craig era from the ruins of “Spectre,” justifying the spy franchise’s decision to abandon standalone adventures in favor of a more serialized arc, and resolving its current run in a way that allows the 007 brand to stay relevant in the face of a Marvel-dominated future that has little room for 59-year-old sex pests on her majesty’s Secret Service. Phew. While several Bonds have come and gone before, none of them have ever really needed to say goodbye — they were all effectively just replacing each other on the same deathless merry-go-round. One unflappably suave British man would get off, and another would step into the open car he left behind. These were movies without a memory, and that was a signature part of their timeless (if always trend-driven) charm. Even after 007’s new wife was assassinated in the closing moments of one film, he was literally a different person by the time the next began. But the Craig-starring saga has played by its own rules from the start. “Casino Royale” cut Bond too deep for his scars to be Etch-a-Sketched away overnight, and so “Quantum of Solace” became the series’ first proper sequel. “Skyfall” explored the past of a character who had always existed in an eternal present, while “Spectre” clumsily attempted to connect that present to a past the character had long outgrown (thereby inventing a template that “Rise of the Skywalker” would later perfect into a miserable art form). And so, in what now seems like an inevitable course-correction, “No Time to Die” is a story about the need to leave certain things behind. It’s the modern spy movie equivalent of “The Last Jedi,” as the universe tells James Bond that he has no choice but to let the past die — to kill it if he has to — and dares Craig to pull the trigger. The actor barely even blinks. Instead, he limps, smirks, and shoots his way through five erratic movies’ worth of pent-up emotion in order to make you cry. The result might be the least exciting Bond film of the 21st century, but it’s undeniably also the most moving. At the end of the day, “No Time to Die” is a second chance at ending Craig’s run on a strong note and tying up all of the frayed threads that “Spectre” left blowing in the wind, and it makes good on that potential even at the expense of several new shortcomings. Written by Bond custodians Neal Purvis and Robert Wade — with assists from Fukunaga and Phoebe “Fleabag” godhead Waller-Bridge — the movie is fittingly also 007’s second chance at the happiness that slipped through his fingers when he took Vesper Lynd on the worst trip to Venice since “Don’t Look Now.” And from the moment it starts with the least Bond-like cold open in the franchise’s history, it’s clear that the spy’s 25th official outing will move forward with at least one eye locked on the rearview mirror. By the time Billie Eilish starts belting out the film’s downbeat title song more than 25 minutes later, it seems entirely possible that Bond may not be able to move forward at all. It begins in a remote patch of Norwegian nowhere some two decades ago, when the eventual Dr. Madeleine Swann — then only a little girl who’s unaware that her father works for Spectre, or that she’ll have the good fortune of growing up to become Léa Seydoux — is visited by a killer in a porcelain mask. “Your father kills people,” the uninvited visitor says to her. “Is that who you love? A murderer?” He might as well be talking to Madeleine (and to us as well) about her future boyfriend. But times change, and James Bond has always been able to change with them, at least to a certain degree. So when 007 and Madeleine arrive in the hilltop village of Matera for an all-too-perfect Italian holiday, she encourages him to stop by Vesper’s grave; Madeleine is smart enough to recognize that James would only share his future with someone if they were able to be honest about their respective pasts. To recognize that they each have them, and ought to keep them where they belong. And that’s when things start blowing up. The chase that follows is far and away the most exciting action setpiece in the entire film, and yet for all of its death-defying leaps and spinning machine-gun cars there’s something muted about the whole affair. The sequence climaxes with an emotionally unnerving (and somewhat unhinged) test of wills unlike anything this series has ever attempted before, and surrenders to the opening credits on a note that feels like it was borrowed from one of Richard Linklater’s “Before” movies. There’s another smash-and-grab bit of carnage when “No Time to Die” picks up again five years later — a bio-weapon heist that takes full advantage of Bond’s retirement from MI6. Not long after that, Ana de Armas swings in for a sublimely charming cameo set in neon-lit Havana, where a Spectre party ends in a frenetic shootout. But such high-octane moments prove to be the exceptions to the rule, as it grows increasingly evident that Fukunaga isn’t following the franchise’s usual template. Sure, the movie touches upon all of the expected Bond tropes: Felix Leiter, explosive watches, a slightly disfigured and wholly underwritten villain who lives on an island fortress somewhere between Russia and Japan (more on him in a minute), etc. There’s even a fight scene in which 007 appears to drink more shots than he fires. And yet “No Time to Die” can’t seem to get through this stuff fast enough — it’s like there’s somewhere else the film would rather be. Someone else its hero would rather be with. What little action this movie has to offer beyond its pulse-raising prologue is contained in short spurts that emphasize intentionality over destruction, the most effective of them being a cat-and-mouse sequence (with serious “Metal Gear Solid” overtones) that patiently watches Bond set up a series of tripwires, only for 007 to off the bad guys in a hurry when they fall into his trap. In other words, anyone hoping for spectacle on par with what Martin Campbell brought to “Goldeneye” and “Casino Royale” will be sorely disappointed by what Fukunaga musters here, even if the film takes full advantage of its IMAX-scale presentation by the end. Over time, this approach slowly becomes more of a feature than a bug, as a standard-issue story about a gene-targeting nanobot weapon capable of targeting specific individuals (or entire ethnicities) is revealed to be nothing but a simple backdrop for a melodrama that’s only masquerading as an action movie. Fukunaga and his fellow writers inherited a whole mess of plot baggage from “Spectre,” and they handle it in the only way they possibly could without replacing Craig altogether: They sign over that baggage to Bond instead, tie all of the dead weight from the previous movie onto his flailing body like an anchor around a sailor lost at sea, and challenge him to slip free of it before he drowns in his own past. By that logic, it’s almost tempting to wonder if Rami Malek is deliberately forgettable as the standard-issue villain who checks all of the expected boxes, never reveals even a semi-cogent explanation for his evil plan, and only exists to make Bond confront his own demons. Few actors could redeem a role this basic — a role so broadly sketched to be 007’s negative image — and Malek isn’t one of them. His instinct to go full Jared Leto in “Blade Runner 2049” is all wrong for Bond’s ultimate adversary, or it would be if Lyutsifer Safin were meant to be more of a threat to Bond than Bond is to himself. “I want the world to evolve,” Lyutsifer whispers at the hero spy in his hodgepodge of a Eastern European accent, “while you want it to stay the same.” One day, see-through self-analysis might not be the only way that Hollywood blockbusters are allowed to be smart, but for now it’s nice to see one so willing to define its terms for us, and so eager to illustrate them with such clever examples (Lashana Lynch is a total blast as the MI6 agent Nomi, both a worthy rival for Bond as well as a potential replacement). Of course, a simple “evolve or die” situation wouldn’t satisfy a legacy as rich as Bond’s, nor a performance as layered as Craig’s. From the moment he got his license to kill, Craig has stood out from his predecessors for being the most bulletproof 007 to ever wear that tuxedo, but also the most vulnerable. His Bond is as sensitive as an exposed nerve, and yet still able to laugh off a direct blow to the testicles from Mads Mikkelsen; he bleeds the same way as the rest of us, but scabs over twice as hard. Connery will always be treasured for giving birth to the character, but it’s Craig who finally allowed him to grow up. Here — in the actor’s final and most affecting go — Bond takes stock of his wounds in order to understand what they were ultimately worth to him, and his conclusion is, in its own absurd way, worth the long and winding road this franchise has taken to get there. “If you have nothing left to give,” someone tells Bond, “you are irrelevant.” But he does. And by figuring out what that is, he buys the franchise that bears his name a new hope for the future. It will probably be a minute before the powers that be decide what that future will look like, but that’s okay. Bond doesn’t need to go faster — he has all the time in the world.",SDT_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Positive,No Time To Die
123,SDT_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,"No Time to Die is an outstanding end to Daniel Craig’s James Bond era. After the lackluster disappointment of 2015’s Spectre, director Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation) delivers a thrilling spectacle that’s far more emotionally fulfilling than I had anticipated. A few minor nitpicks notwithstanding, I loved this one. No Bond actor has ever exited the role quite the same way Craig does here. The fifth and final entry in the actor’s reign as author Ian Fleming’s iconic British spy, No Time to Die is an action-heavy swan song that brings this version of 007 full circle. Back in 2006’s Casino Royale, his Bond was introduced as a talented newbie with definite skills and a lot left to learn; now he’s the grizzled veteran ready to call it a day yet still determined to lay it all on the line for Queen and country. Sean Connery didn’t get this type of finale, leaving on his own terms before coming back to Bond for two one-off stories, probably at the inducement of mountains of cash. George Lazenby was in only one Bond film, 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, but as it’s widely considered one of the franchise’s best outings, I feel his stint as 007 should be considered in a positive light. Roger Moore started to show his age, and while I enjoy both 1983’s Octopussy and 1985’s A View to a Kill, it’s hard to disagree with those who felt that the actor had overstayed his welcome. Timothy Dalton only got two turns as the character, 1987’s The Living Daylights and 1989’s License to Kill, and while he was closer in tone to Fleming’s literary iteration of Bond, it’s clear his cutthroat take wasn’t what audiences wanted after over a decade of Moore’s suavely comedic incarnation. As for Pierce Brosnan, while 2002’s Die Another Day is widely thought to be one of the lesser Bond films, it was still a massive, worldwide box office hit. I think the decision to move on from him had more to do with the success of The Bourne Identity than it did anything else. Brosnan never got the opportunity for one last ride as 007 mainly because producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson determined they could make more money by switching to a more serious and less elegantly exaggerated tone, thus opening the door for Craig. I can’t say Broccoli and Wilson were wrong in their assessment. Craig’s 007 adventures, while wavering in quality, have proven to be hugely popular with audiences around the globe. The additional time between installments has also allowed the actor to age with Bond and not against him – as happened with Moore – each new film letting him show more wear and tear as the years take their toll on the secret agent. Craig’s Bond earned all of his scars, and it’s no wonder that at the outset of No Time to Die, he is ready to turn in his license to kill and drive off in his Aston Martin into the Jamaican sunset. But just as Bond thinks he is out, leave it to old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) to pull him back in. The CIA agent needs his help: Spectre has kidnapped Russian genetic scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) who had been previously working for the British, and the rumor is that his latest breakthrough could be a lethal boon for the powerful terrorist organization. He’s currently being stashed in Cuba, and Leiter has orders to get him out, alive if possible, dead if necessary, to ensure his discovery isn’t unleashed on an unsuspecting world. Things aren’t that simple. Turns out the British want the scientist back, and M (Ralph Fiennes) has dispatched his newest 007 (Lashana Lynch) to retrieve him. One thing leads to another and Bond is back in London inside MI6 headquarters. He’s reunited with Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) and must come face-to-face once again with the now-imprisoned Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). His relationship with those two indirectly ties Bond to a new threat, the mysterious Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), who has his hands on a viral weapon that, once unleashed, could kill billions. I think the most astonishing thing about No Time to Die is that, unlike in Spectre, Craig and Seydoux have actual chemistry. Fukunaga generates serious heat between them, and both actors are fully invested in Bond and Swann’s tragically complex relationship, while last time around it was like they were appearing in completely different motion pictures. When the pair are forced to separate during the explosive pre-credits sequence, I could feel a lump form in my throat. Unexpectedly reuniting five years later moments before they interrogate Blofeld about the missing Obruchev, a palpable chill passes between them. Finally, when the climax kicks into gear and they both discover they have something personal that’s worth fighting for, there is passion in their embrace and authentic shivers are born from their joining forces once again. And who is Safin? Why are Bond and Swann so important to him? Those are questions better left unanswered on my part. While Safin is not a topflight 007 villain, and even though I Malek underplays his role a bit too much for my liking, there is still something about this killer’s coldblooded solemnity I found chilling. I should mention Ana de Armas. She pops in briefly during the Cuba sequence as Paloma, a young CIA agent sent by Leiter to assist Bond in rescuing that Russian scientist. The actress comes exceedingly close to stealing the film right out from underneath the main character. Paloma is a burst of unexpected adrenaline, a manic jolt of pixie dust who makes such a dynamic impression before suddenly disappearing with an angelic smile it’s impossible not to miss de Armas once events move back to London and she’s no longer a part of the story. Fukunaga makes it all work. The action sequences have volatile urgency, the dramatic moments are effectively heartfelt, and the characters – both returning and new – are worth getting to know. Callbacks to the entire series feel organic, not forced. The emotional wallop of a finale is well-earned, and not since the aforementioned On Her Majesty’s Secret Service have tears shed during a James Bond flick felt so entirely genuine and undeniably warranted. But this is Craig’s show, and his last shot as 007 hits the bullseye. No Time to Die was well worth the wait. I’m excited to see it again.",SDT_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Positive,No Time To Die
124,SDT_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,"James Bond (Daniel Craig, in reportedly his last appearance in the role) is retired in ""No Time to Die,"" the latest big-screen outing for Ian Fleming's spy. And director Cary Joji Fukunaga's film — at 163 minutes, it is the longest in the history of the franchise — wants it to be seen on the big screen. As for whether it is worthwhile, the long and the short of it is that this entry in the series has a series of lengthy expository scenes that set up the exciting action set pieces — just like every other Bond film. However, ""No Time to Die"" is mostly enjoyable and never dull. Call it Craig's second-best of his five Bond films, just below ""Casino Royale."" Craig is as cool as ever as Bond, and he commences with his derring-do, dispatching baddies with considerable aplomb. He is unflappable driving his souped-up Aston Martin, even when he does donuts to foil his pursuers. He can come out guns blazing to subdue those who want to kill him — although a sequence in a stairwell feels way too much like a video game. He even manages to survive a near-death experience at sea, because, well, it is No Time to Die. Alas, Bond's punny one-liners in this adventure are kind of lame. But back to the beginning. ""No Time to Die"" opens with a child-in-peril sequence. A young girl and her mother are targeted by a masked man who spares the child. Cut to Bond and Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux reprising her role from ""Spectre"") in Italy where they are having a romantic getaway. But when Bond goes to pay respects to the late Vesper Lynd, he gets wind of a double-cross and a chase sequence follows. How things end up provide the film with its pre-credit sequence. (Cue the familiar James Bond theme music and Billie Eilish's rendition of the title song.) The intrigue continues five years later when Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) contacts Bond who is enjoying his retirement to do ""one last job for old time's sake."" Felix and Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen), a U.S. State Department guy, need Bond to go to Cuba to get Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) who has a DNA-targeted weapon that uses nanobots and relies on skin contact to kill. The Cuba sequence is arguably the film's highlight. Bond meets Nomi (Lashana Lynch), who is known as 007 now that Bond has retired — they banter in a fun game of one-upmanship — and Paloma (Ana de Armas, Craig's ""Knives Out"" costar), who has had about three weeks of training. Paloma is fantastic, kicking ass in a dress to die for no less, and de Armas plays her as nervous and naïve, which is amusing. In contrast, Nomi is tough as nails and not to be messed with, even if Bond makes her work extra hard to prove herself worthy of the number. That Bond relies on both women to assist him in his various missions is appealing. (The series seems to have done away with the ""Bond Girl"" trope here, offering female action heroes of color, a nice development). The Cuba section of the film also shows that Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz, reprising the role) is still controlling things even though he is in a maximum security prison. ""No Time to Die"" introduces its chief villain around the halfway mark, and he is Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), the masked man from the opening sequence. It would perhaps spoil a twist to reveal the connection between Safin and Blofeld, but what can be told is that Waltz plays up Blofeld's sinister nature in his one big scene (shades of ""Silence of the Lambs"") whereas Malek is a bland villain here. What is even more dispiriting, the Oscar-winning actor appears to be channeling Peter Lorre, even down to his accent and cadence. The biggest flaw in ""No Time to Die"" is not that Safin has only a few scenes, but that he is not very menacing when he is onscreen. (Malek's Safin could rate as the blandest Bond villain). Thankfully, there are other pleasures. An enjoyable sequence had Bond, well, bonding with Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) when he needs the later to crack a flash drive he pocketed in Cuba. There is also some tension between Bond and M (Ralph Fiennes) which provides the film with a kind of moral undergirding. Granted, ""No Time to Die"" is jerry-rigged to be pure escapism — it is certainly not deep — but it is nice that M grapples with some weighty decisions, which include the possible start of international warfare. Fukunaga nimbly keeps all the elements in play. There are picturesque locations (Italy!), there are some breathtaking aerial stunts(!), and there are some clever gadgets (Bond's watch!). Only the film's extended finale, which takes place on a disputed island between Japan and Russia, feels stretched out. But overall this Bond delivers what fans have come to expect from a 007 film, no more, no less.",SDT_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Positive,No Time To Die
125,SDT_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,"No Time to Die, the latest and last appearance of Daniel Craig as James Bond, is a lot of movie. It’s so much movie that one hardly knows where to begin. So let’s start with the runtime, which carries on for 165 minutes. Long movies don’t deter me, assuming the time is well spent, but this one felt overstuffed. Director Cary Joji Fukanaga, the first American director to helm an entry in the franchise’s 60-year history, gives the audience plenty to contemplate, and not all of it feels essential or necessary. Fukanaga and his posse of screenwriters—including Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge—concoct a script chock full of elaborate plotting, drearily murky characters, and weighty themes. These writers have much to do, crafting the final Craig entry. Their screenplay must weave together the narrative threads from the last four movies, starting with Casino Royale (2006). They must consider the series’ clandestine evil organizations and strained relationships, both personal and professional. At the same time, the audience expects rousing action sequences, death puns, and daring spycraft. Plus, unique to No Time to Die is a sense of closure and finality to the Craig run, ensuring that its star never has to return to the franchise he love-hates. As I mentioned, it’s a lot. Devoted fans of the franchise will eat up this hardy helping of cinematic comfort food with a delirious smile, content that the filmmakers have planned a glorious final chapter for their hero. After nearly two years of delays due to the pandemic, the fact that we’re seeing the movie at all seems like something that might’ve never happened. But here we are, and boy howdy, is it a lot. It’s not merely the latest spy-actioner in the series; it’s a sprawling and contemplative movie about the baggage we carry. Early in No Time to Die, Bond and his new lover from Spectre (2015), Madeline Swann (Léa Seydoux), vacation in the Mediterranean. She wants him to say goodbye to his past, namely Vesper, the femme fatale who broke his heart in Casino Royale, and only then will Madeline share her past. This is a movie obsessed with the past. Its characters have been scarred and remain unable to move beyond their histories. Eventually, Bond comes to terms with Vesper and her betrayal, but in doing so, he finds reason to suspect that Madeline works for the super-secret villain club, Spectre. Since he can no longer trust her, Bond leaves Madeline and retires to a beach in Jamaica. Five years pass, meaning the characters have stewed in their unresolved conflicts for half a decade. But their issues with the past go further back as well. In a pre-credits scene, a preadolescent Madeline finds her childhood home in Norway attacked by a masked man, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). To exact revenge for his family’s murder, Lyutsifer wants to kill Mr. White, who is Madeline’s father and the baddie from earlier movies, but he’ll take White’s wife and child instead. After killing the mother, Lyutsifer shows mercy on Madeline and saves her. He uses this life debt later in the movie when he needs Madeline to carry out an assassination—an ultimatum he delivers in Malek’s droning and daresay Jared Leto-esque mannerisms. “He’s weird,” remarks one of Madeline’s coworkers rudely, though she’s not wrong. Lyutsifer, whose name my spell checker wants to auto-correct to Lucifer, is an absurd villain with a shortsighted end-the-world scheme that feels concocted by screenwriters and not by ideology or emotion. He plans to sell engineerable nanobots to the highest bidder, giving the buyer the power to select their target according to a DNA profile. They can be used to kill one person in a crowded room, or they can be used to wipe out an entire race. Stakes aside, No Time to Die forces its characters to make life-and-death decisions based on the past’s magnetic pull. Everyone has regrets and scars, some quite literal in Lyutsifer’s case (his face consists of milky flesh, occasionally covered by a cracked doll mask). Everyone’s plagued by their mistakes and need for redemption or revenge. You can feel this oppressive weight in nearly every scene. But there are two exceptions. The first comes in an effervescent sequence that takes Bond to Cuba and pairs him with Paloma (Ana de Armas), a sprightly young agent whose all-too-brief scenes might be the only time this movie evokes a smile or has fun. The other is Nomi (Lashana Lynch), the new 007 with something to prove. She’s around for much longer and supplies a constant reminder that Bond’s time has passed. Refreshingly, No Time to Die doesn’t call out how the new generation of superagents finally includes non-white men and women, and it avoids overemphasizing its inclusiveness. But unfortunately, the script gives them little to do besides aid Bond in his mission. The plot’s machinations send him from Cuba to Norway to a small Japanese island, where the story comes to a close in Lyutsifer’s secret lair, a former missile complex. Fukanaga delivers a good-looking movie with a couple of fine action sequences, but No Time to Die doesn’t dazzle. In the wake of Skyfall (2011), it’s difficult to imagine another James Bond movie looking half as good, thereby making every subsequent entry a mild disappointment. Cinematographer Linus Sandgren uses a foggy Norwegian forest for a gorgeous shootout, and production designer Mark Tildesley creates some memorable sets, particularly the cell holding Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and Lyutsifer’s aforementioned lair. There’s an impressive extended take, recalling the one in Atomic Blonde (2017), where Bond makes his way up some stairs and takes out a barrage of bad guys, and it’s edited together to look like a single shot. Somehow, all of this makes less of an impact than Lisa-Dorah Sonnet, the little girl who plays the daughter of Madeline and Bond. Her delicate presence and quiet French voice humanize our hero in a way not felt since Casino Royale. They remind us that beneath the surface of Craig’s Bond, his harsh expressions, clenched jaw, and alcohol dependency, lies someone wounded, melancholic, and in need of someone else to love and trust. Trust is difficult to come by in the spy game. So are happy endings, apparently. Craig’s finale (which I will discuss in detail, so skip this paragraph if you must) feels wrong. Certainly, Bond was bound to lose his life sooner or later. You can only save the world from supervillains for so long before one of them gets the best of you. But the climactic scenes in No Time to Die feel undeserving. Malek’s scenery-chewing performance as Lyutsifer finds him pontificating about how he and Bond are both heroes marked by the past. There’s a scuffle, and Lyutsifer scratches Bond with a cracked vial of blood. He has been infected with nanobots that will infect Madeline and Mathilde if they come in contact with Bond. So he resolves to remain on the island, where British missiles will detonate Lyutsifer’s nanobot farm. There’s a teary goodbye via earpiece radio, and there endeth James Bond, leaving his lover and daughter to live with nothing more than a memory. It’s a fitting end in some respects. Bond had to go eventually, right? But couldn’t he just retire from service, the way Connery, Moore, and Brosnan did? While contemplating how preferable a happily ever after ending might’ve been—with Bond and his newfound brood playing on an isolated beach somewhere in the Caribbean, perhaps—consider a plot hole that may have saved our hero. When Q (Ben Whishaw, delightful as ever) gives Bond a watch that can release an EMP, the 007 uses the pulse to detonate a bionic eye inside a henchman’s head. So why can’t Bond use the same pulse to neutralize nanobots? After all, they’re microscopic machines, right? And if that wouldn’t work, couldn’t Q cook something up in the lab? In any case, the movie’s rules concerning this EMP are wildly inconsistent. At one point, Bond opens several electronic locks with his EMP, but it somehow doesn’t affect his radio earpiece. Although quibbles of this nature are best left to fanboy forums, the point is that the ending feels unearned and sloppy. The writers are more interested in propelling Bond to his demise than crafting a situation that feels like Bond’s death is necessary.What’s next, then? Perhaps it’s another origin story on par with Casino Royale. James Bond seems to be taking the path of Batman and Spider-Man, where every few years the studios will start over with a new actor. a new timeline. But more than that—and this is the banality of it—they will doubtlessly retell his origin story and create a new Bondverse. Of course, James Bonds have come and gone over the years, but they rarely had beginnings or endings—not to the extent of Craig’s version, anyway. Earlier films did not build a universe in the manner of the MCU. It was unclear if Moore’s Bond had experienced everything Connery’s had, and that never mattered before. But general audiences today may expect a more connected cinematic universe, which makes Bond somehow more temporary. No Time to Die certainly proves he’s mortal. Will the same be true of the franchise? It’s both rewarding to see Craig’s version receive some finality but also grating to think that we might be introduced to another new recruit in a few years. That feels like a minor betrayal of what Bond fans have come to expect over six decades of mantle passing.",SDT_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Negative,No Time To Die
126,SDT_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,"Let the mourning begin.  In No Time to Die, James Bond is dead after 25 installments of the popular series about England’s most glamorous secret agent—which means he will never be back—in his present form.  This is also Daniel Craig’s fifth and final appearance as 007, so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time, too.  Do this, I hasten to add, only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who, in your heart of hearts, can do no wrong.  In my opinion, he ran out of steam long ago, and now in retirement from Her Majesty’s Secret Service, he has no charm, no wit, no sex appeal, no fatal allure for women and he’s losing his hair. He dies from stray bullets, deja vu, stale dialogue and mixed reviews.  The car chases, the fight sequences (there are two), the helicopter shots, the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before.  This is probably to be expected.  You don’t go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new. You go to ogle the latest girls, gadgets and exotic locations.  The entertainment values are ever apparent, the violence and bloodshed have a certain lift that both defines and defies imagination, and who would have it any other way?  You don’t always remember what you saw the next day, but you know you had some fun.  This time the excitement fades like the popcorn that went with it, and for me, ennui comes on stealthy fingers.  No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made, but it’s in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy.  The film’s sole distinction is the fact that it’s the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore. Directed with more boyish slobber than narrative coherence by Cary Joji Fukunaga from an over-crammed, self-consciously contrived script by no fewer than five writers,  No Time to Die hops and stumbles all over the place, but you can still write the plot on the head of a carpet tack.  It opens with a flashback to the Italian Alps where a mysterious thug in a white mask plods through the snow to murder a young Madeleine Swann’s mother, but young Madeleine narrowly escapes.  Cut to the character, all grown up as Léa Seydoux, who may or may not be married to a gooey-eyed, lovesick 007. (The movie is very vague about things that matter.)  After some high-speed racing through the mountains in his bulletproof Aston Martin, the two lovers are set upon by agents from the evil crime syndicate SPECTRE in the town square and he dumps Madeleine, thinking she betrayed him.  It’s the end for Bond and Madeleine, but the movie is just beginning.  It helps to know your Ian Fleming history, including Bond’s relationship with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, as well as the meaning of SPECTRE (you got me there).  Cut to Bond trying desperately trying to enjoy his retirement in Jamaica only to reluctantly join forces with his old pal, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) to return to action in order to stop the criminal manufacture of some kind of inexplicable poison called “nanobots” that are injected into the bloodstream to kill the victim’s DNA, and which can spread like the COVID-19 virus and eventually destroy the world. Soon the screen is overpopulated with tertiary characters, including Leiter’s pal Ash (Billy Magnussen) who turns out to be a double agent, kidnapped M16 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) who invented the nanobots, a new agent named Nomi (Lashana Lynch) who has been assigned Bond’s old 007 code number, and a sexy M16 agent named Paloma (Ana de Armas) who spends her time between shootouts searching for the perfect black cocktail dress. Then there’s the great, wasted Christoph Waltz, doing his Silence of the Lambs ripoff in a padded cell in London, and master fiend Lyutsifer Safin, played obnoxiously by Rami Malek, who won an Oscar for Bohemian Rhapsody for reasons I still find baffling.  He could give lessons in hysterical overacting to Lou Costello.  Cut to an island off the coast of Japan, where Safin controls the nanobots from a Nazi bunker left over from World War II and stages an elaborate third-act battle that ends Daniel Craig’s 007 tenure with bloody knuckles and a bomb that destroys  a landscape the size of Rhode Island.  Madeleine shows up with a daughter of her own, who she declares to be James Bond’s daughter, but nothing in the movie makes any sense, so after 165 minutes of gibberish, why start asking questions now?  Something special vanished when they killed off M and Judi Dench exited with her (M is now Ralph Fiennes, who has learned to mumble) and to my eye Daniel Craig has never replaced the one and only Sean Connery.  Still, I think he deserves a better farewell party than this.  No Time to Die is more of a send-up than a send-off.",SDT_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Negative,No Time To Die
127,SDT_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,"For those whose cinematic consciousness predates “Star Wars,” the James Bond series may be the primordial experience of franchise films, with all the pleasures and limitations that they entail. The appealing predictability of familiar characters and the excitement of seeing variations on their themes has always gone hand in hand with a sense of overmanagement—of the strings being pulled by some puppeteer far from the set. The feeling that what’s onscreen is inseparable from the demands of the balance sheet has never been absent from the Bond market, and the five entries starring Daniel Craig have only intensified it. Together, the Craig films interconnect to form a sort of Bond cinematic universe whose parts slot all too neatly into a series, with all the dramatic engineering that it implies. The most recent and final Craig film, “No Time to Die,” directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, is in that sense a culmination of the series’ necessities, with the boardroom and the writers’ room virtually taking the place of any cinematic action. On the other hand, the series’ essential virtue was always its extravagant exaggerations—it was gloriously ridiculous and gloriously lacking in self-awareness, its macho ribaldry invested with absurdly high purpose. In the Daniel Craig era, there’s no sense of unconscious or excess expression—it has been digitized out along with any intentional humor. The devices that Bond and his compatriots use are hardly a step from Maxwell Smart’s shoe phone, as are the switch-operated gizmos of his Aston Martin. Yet their depiction and use are so perfunctory that they’re presented as neither silly nor ordinary, just checked off. Craig is a great actor who brings a distinctive affect to Bond—clenched, airtight, impenetrable, abraded. He makes Bond’s social graces seem like the product of work that’s harder than the athleticized superhero business imposed upon the character. Craig’s distinctive persona suggests pathos that the series doesn’t allow; instead, he’s merely used as a Bond-piñata, a straining for an element of realism amid stunts that, in their grandiosity and their excess, preclude it. In “No Time to Die,” Bond is launched with mourning and melancholy: he and his new partner, Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), visit the Italian town of Matera, where the tomb of Vesper Lynd (from “Casino Royale”) is found. Bond visits her tomb—which explodes, as a prelude to a mighty chase and shoot-out. He survives but immediately ends the romance with Madeleine, whom he suspects of setting him up. Five years later, Bond, retired to Jamaica, gets a visit from an old associate, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), of the C.I.A., along with a smarmy young State Department official named Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen). They want Bond’s help in finding a scientist named Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik), who has been kidnapped from a high-security bioweapon facility with a dreadful concoction in hand: a mortal virus-like nanobot, transmitted on contact and engineered to target specific DNA markers, whether of an individual, a family, or an ethnicity. But it takes a visit, that very night, from another M.I.6 operative, Nomi (Lashana Lynch)—who now bears Bond’s former number, 007—to persuade Bond of the urgency of the mission, and he joins in. It seems that Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), Bond’s longtime nemesis (dating back to childhood, as we now know), and Blofeld’s dastardly organization Spectre, is behind the kidnapping. But, infiltrating a Spectre gathering in Cuba, Bond and Nomi note the involvement of another evil mastermind, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), and the mission now involves targeting him along with Obruchev. Yet “No Time to Die” offers a new piece of the puzzle, a bit of backstory that’s of obvious and major significance (shh) and that, by its very nature, suggests what’s both right and wrong with the franchise reboot in the Craig era. In the film’s opening, pre-title sequence, Madeleine is a child of about five (played by Lisa-Dorah Sonnet), staying with her mother (Mathilde Bourbin) in an isolated house in a snowy field and yearning for the return of her father (Mr. White, introduced in “Casino Royale”). She thinks he’s a doctor; her mother reveals that he’s a killer. Moments later, a masked gunman—Safin—shows up and breaks in. When Safin was a child, he explains, Mr. White killed his entire family, leaving only Safin to survive. Now, seeking revenge, he kills Madeleine’s mother, and prepares to kill the fleeing Madeleine, yet—in a moment of pity that may also carry an element of self-recognition—lets her go. (The moment, like so many others in the film, is merely conveyed in an informative wink rather than actually unfurled at any length.) Along with imparting the trauma and grief that Madeleine bears, the sequence insures that, later in the film, when Safin intrudes into Bond’s affairs, Madeleine can’t be far behind. This setup implies a broader question about the role and use of backstory in recent movies. In principle, the prevalence of backstory advances an overdue democratization of the cinema: it eliminates the notion of typecasting and recognizes that each individual’s background and experience are distinctive and significant. Yet, like any dramatic method, the planting of backstory can take a decadent form, as it does in “No Time to Die,” where backstory is used to reduce the characters’ motives to single factors. With the setting up of one past experience, the movie bypasses any consideration of Madeleine (let alone Safin) as a character and turns her into a dramatic mechanism—rendering her not more of an individual but less of one. Fascinatingly and dismayingly, backstories are applied only very selectively and deterministically in “No Time to Die.” The movie brings several important new characters into the franchise, starting with Nomi, the new 007, who is a Black woman, and including Paloma (Ana de Armas), a C.I.A. agent who guides Bond into the Spectre meeting in Cuba. (The closest thing to humor that the movie offers is in the contrast between Paloma’s sunny ingenuousness and her mighty skills.) What motives prompted this admirably diverse cast of characters to serve their country in dangerous missions? What range of experience contributed to their ability to do so? The film never says. The diversity here is purely pictorial. The formulaic drama is of a piece with the movie’s action sequences, which exhaust their ingenuity from the get-go, with the Matera chase and shoot-out. The single best moment is the very first, when, on a narrow bridge, Bond dodges a speeding car with a deft dive behind a convenient lump of concrete. The action soon grows wilder—a leap while holding a cable and a rough landing, a motorcycle jaunt up staircases and over a wall—and briefly offers a moment of tension, with Bond and Madeleine together in the Aston Martin while facing a barrage of bullets that the car’s windows barely withstand. (Bond’s stoic stillness in the face of Madeleine’s panic is also Craig’s best moment.) But, despite these (very brief) clever touches, the filming does this and other set pieces scant justice. Little attention is given to staging and placing, to ensembles and their timing, to the practicalities of massive stunts, whether chase scenes or shoot-outs or trouble on the high seas. What matters isn’t spatial coherence—which is only a virtue in real estate—but coherence of ideas, of emotions, of images. The shots, whether brief and collaged together or closely following Bond in motion, do little but convey the general concept or the basic facts, the input and the outcome. The rapid cutting and rapid camera movement don’t make the action hard to understand; they make it hard to enjoy. For all the agony that the story’s violence suggests, and the sense of rueful wonder, of horrified fascination, that it depends on, the filming gives no sense of experience either onscreen or behind it—merely a sense of dutiful, approximative technique. “No Time to Die” wants it both ways: it makes watching violent shoot-outs and colossal catastrophes pleasurable while depicting them merely functionally, a coy fusion of the sumptuous and the abstemious. Similarly, the story is built upon an emotional foundation of melancholy and regret, of the sins of the fathers and the pain of their redemption. But these aspects of the drama get neither discussed nor developed, merely signified in the sweep of the action. Moreover, the story is almost completely depoliticized; the only hint of a viewpoint is when Ash is derisively pinpointed as a “political appointee.” All that remains, besides the vapors of nostalgia, are the broad contours of the drama, which are less matters of character or history than of positioning in the movie marketplace. Daniel Craig’s tenure as Bond is defined, ultimately, by the melancholy of unimagined possibilities and missed opportunities—for the actor and the character alike.

128,SDT_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,"The new James Bond movie “No Time To Die” is the 25th official entry in the franchise and the fifth and last starring Daniel Craig. It will likely be the entry point for many moviegoers reluctant until now to reembrace the big-screen experience. It offers up the requisite thrills, stunts, and bad guys. Beautiful people abound, and 007 still knows how to fill out a tux. I had a reasonably good time at it. But, as I watched this latest installment – overlong at 163 minutes – the thought also occurred to me: Has James Bond become irrelevant? Perhaps he never was relevant, but certainly, as a Cold War-era icon, he embodied, for both men and women, a large swath of that generation’s fantasies about masculinity and how to look supercool while rescuing the globe from imminent destruction. Does this sort of thing play today? In “No Time To Die,” directed by Cary JoJi Fukunaga, we are presented yet again with the generic template: The odious Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek, in a surprisingly pallid performance) is mass-producing a DNA-targeted pathogen that can quickly obliterate entire nations. It’s up to Bond, reluctantly coming out of retirement after his last stint in “Spectre,” to save the day – and the world. This description makes the film sound much campier than it is. There’s no “Austin Powers” in this film’s genes. This should not come as a surprise. Craig first played Bond 15 years ago in “Casino Royale,” and, unlike his predecessors – notably Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan – he was rough-hewn and feral. I welcomed the makeover at the time but, in Craig’s subsequent appearances, the sullen moodiness grew tiresome. He overcorrected. In “No Time To Die,” Bond, in a carry-over from “Spectre,” remains entranced with the glossily beautiful psychologist Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), even when it appears she has betrayed him. This is a secret agent whose real secret, it turns out, is that he’s kind of a softy. He even gets a mite emotional over a kidnapped girl’s stuffed rabbit. From a dramatic standpoint, all this moodiness makes sense: It gives Bond some unexplored terrain – namely, himself – to plumb. By contrast, the action sequences are nothing we haven’t seen before, and often, better. The filmmakers seem to recognize there is only so much that can be done to top the franchise’s legacy of derring-do, and so they emphasize instead Bond’s incipient soulfulness. Others in the cast – including Lashana Lynch’s Nomi, the female agent who has temporarily inherited the retired Bond’s 007 designation, or, too briefly, the CIA operative Paloma (a spirited Ana de Armas, who appeared opposite Craig in “Knives Out”) – perform a fair amount of the knockabout theatrics. It could even be argued that the techno-whiz Q (Ben Whishaw), and not Bond, is the real hero here. It is he who maps out the treacherous trajectory that Bond dutifully follows in the final elimination round with Safin. With all the talk about who should be the next James Bond, perhaps the solution is hiding in plain sight. Why not a supernerd? What “No Time To Die” grudgingly acknowledges is that the world is too intractable, too dangerous, for any one person to rescue. This admission is made, as usual, with hardly any explicit reference to real-life menace. Bond villains since the Cold War, with few exceptions, have almost always been otherworldly loonies. This is one big reason the franchise up to now has been such an escapist joyride. The only global catastrophes in them are make-believe. Much as we might wish it to be otherwise, “No Time To Die” comes out at a time, and in a world, where it may no longer be possible to escape in the same way. Bond may still be relevant to our fantasy lives, but for him to be a savior of worlds, I suspect another makeover will be required.",SDT_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,SDT,Action,Negative,No Time To Die
129,SDT_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,"Daniel Craig makes his royal exit in ""No Time to Die,"" a handsome if entirely too long James Bond adventure that struggles with James Bond's place in the modern world. And just what is that place? There once was a time when there was nothing cooler than a debonair British super-spy with a license to kill. The tailored suits, the cool gadgets, the fancy cars and the colorful bad guys all helped shape this cinematic fantasy world that we'd dip our toes into every few years or so. But in 2021 — nearly 60 years and 25 films into the franchise — is James Bond still the hero we crave? Does the series need an update, or an all-out retirement? For Craig, ""No Time to Die"" is a retirement party, and that retirement can't come soon enough. Craig is a suave, serious Bond, more grounded than Pierce Brosnan and less hammy than Roger Moore, and likely the best to wear the suit since Sean Connery. But for all its GQ aesthetics, the Craig period — five films over 15 years, the longest tenure, timewise, of any Bond — has been a dour, muted one for the series. Craig never seemed too pleased with the checklist of Bond-isms that come with the job, and in ""No Time to Die"" when he's called on to order a drink shaken, not stirred or introduce himself last name first, first name last, he looks like his eyes are going to roll so far back into his head that they'll go permanently white. For as good as he looks in Bond's suits, he's never seemed all that comfortable in the role. In ""No Time to Die,"" the conversations about Bond from the outside world — about James Bond's casting, and whether or not the role is exclusive to White males — come seeping into Bond's reality. After he steps away from active duty, Bond's 007 handle is reassigned to a Black woman, Nomi (Lashana Lynch), an internal decision at MI6 and an external one for the filmmakers to drag Bond kicking and screaming into modern times. See, folks, people are listening to your tweets! In terms of narrative, it gives Craig's Bond something to push up against. As the film opens — a dazzling car chase through the streets of Italy is part of the 25-minute pre-credits sequence — Bond is lovesick after leaving Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), whom he accuses of betraying her. He lays low for five years and then comes back to ward off a bioweapon in the form of a deadly airborne disease coded specifically to individuals' DNA; picture COVID, but weaponized, and you're on the right track. (The film was made pre-COVID, but winds up being scarily timely.) Rami Malek plays the villain, Lyutsifer Safin, whose speech pattern is so affected and thought out by the actor that he comes off as an attention-starved theater kid, not a guy who poses any credible real world threat. Malek's line readings — and it's a role that's mostly dialogue-driven — are definitely a choice, and his Lyutsifer is bizarre, but it's hard not to chuckle whenever he is on screen. Christoph Waltz's Blofeld is wheeled out at one point with such grandiosity and buildup that you might feel bad for not remembering what previous Bond film he was in; it was 2015's ""Spectre,"" which I definitely had to look up. (Some sort of ""previously on James Bond"" refresher may have helped jog the memory of non-Bond obsessive.). Director Cary Joji Fukunaga (TV's ""True Detective"") stages some impressive action set pieces, especially one in a dense forest, and there's a great sequence with Ana de Armas as a bubbly CIA agent who brings some much needed levity to the film. When she and Bond stop to take a drink in the middle of a shootout, it's a reminder that these movies should be fun. But ""No Time to Die"" is obsessed with being heavy and consequential, and bringing meaning to the Bond character and his actions. It all circles back to the question of what do we want from James Bond, and what should we want from James Bond. Do we want anything from James Bond? These movies definitely hold a place in our collective cinematic memories, but what is his relevance, if any, to today's landscape? It's a good time to ask those questions. And ""No Time to Die"" does its job by clearing the slate for those answers to be found and for a new era to begin — when the time is right, whenever that may be.

130,DWB_Doc1_LegallyBlonde,"Newcomer Robert Luketic makes his feature film debut and has the good fortune to hook up with the talented Reese Witherspoon. Overall, ""Legally Blonde"" is a lost opportunity that uses cliche instead of originality to make its point that just because someone is a blonde, it doesn't necessarily mean they are dumb. Fortunately, Witherspoon is a talented young actress who has strong comedic ability and is able to carry the film herself. This is a good thing as the script by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith doesn't get beyond the two-dimensional. From the very start of the flick, we are presented with a character, Elle, who is by no means a dumb bunny. When Warner dumps her because she's not smart enough, I began to have a problem with the story. How could this guy spend so much time with Elle and not see that she is not just a pretty face? When she gains admission, at the last minute, to Harvard Law School, it should be apparent, to all, that Elle is not just smart, she is very smart. But, if the characters in the film were as observant as we are, they would realize that Elle is special and there wouldn't be a movie here. So, we have to wait until they all come to their senses and see Elle for what she really is. The burden of carrying ""Legally Blonde"" falls upon the shoulders of Reese Witherspoon and, with confidence and capability, she pulls it off. There is little beneath the surface of the story as we watch Elle prove herself smart time and time again. She is not just pretty and soon proves herself equal to any intellectual task presented her. She is, of course, selected by one of her professors (Victor Garber) to be a law clerk on a high profile murder case. Her ex-boyfriend, Warner, and his new, serious (i.e. not blonde) girlfriend Vivian (Selma Blair) are also part of the team and Elle has to prove, repeatedly, that her blonde roots have not dumbed her down. Eventually, everyone gets the point. There is little going on with the supporting cast, mainly due to the shallow script that develops no one besides Elle. Luke Wilson is an obvious romantic interest, but that whole development is left as a footnote at the end of the film. Selma Blair, who made such a funny, charming splash in ""Cruel Intentions,"" is left out in the cold as non-blonde Vivian. Matthew Davis is clueless as Warner and it makes one wonder just what Elle would see in such a narrow-minded and not that bright a guy. The rest of the cast members are more symbolic than real. Overall, production values are on the cheap side and, like the screenplay, shallow. Photography, by Anthony B. Richmond, looks murky and, except for some nice shots of Boston and Cambridge, is not notable. Kudos to Sophie de Rakoff Carbonell for her costuming of Witherspoon and her pet Chihuahua, Bruiser. There is more than just a passing similarity to the comedy hit, ""Clueless,"" as Elle goes about improving the quality of life for those around her, including making a dorky law student a babe magnet. We've been here before and seen it done better. But, Witherspoon holds her own and makes ""Legally Blonde"" watchable, at least.",DWB_Doc1_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
131,DWB_Doc2_LegallyBlonde,"Legally BlondeÊis, of course, a pun on ""legally blind,"" and that's a pretty good place to start in assessing this movie, which seems to perceive its lead character as, at best, a wispy blur. Sometimes it doesn't see her at all, even though she's right there in front of us, in stiletto pumps and wide pink lapels. Watching the movie got me thinking about another old phrase, ""vanity project,"" which usually described a play or film so obviously centered around a single performance that the star's desire for attention was the project's soleÊraison d'tre: think Billy Crystal inÊMr. Saturday Night, Jodie Foster inÊNell, or Bette Midler inÊFor the Boys.ÊLegally Blonde, if it had more presumptions to substance, might be called a ""vanity project"" for star Reese Witherspoon, and yet the term would have to be ironic, because the character of Elle Woods is both its reason for being and its central flaw. No one knows who she is. One person Elle isn't, try as everyone may, is Cher Horowitz, the insouciant, deceptively sharp Valley Girl brought so vividly to life by Amy Heckerling and Alicia Silverstone inÊClueless. Cher is such a distinct, well-drawn character that she almost topples the rest ofÊClueless, particularly toward the end, when it becomes evident that the other characters and indeed the entire scenario aren't nearly as specific or as fully alive as she is. Would thatÊLegally BlondeÊhad that problem. Here is how far the newer movie gets, hoping lightning will strike twice: Reese-As-Elle duplicates Cher's big saucer eyes, her insolent, lippy pout, her fondness for improbably furry phones and other way-stylized accessories. She lives in Cher's neck of the woods, as a sorority president at fictional C.U.L.A., she's all over the tropical-colored ensembles, and she's got a cute, upwardly mobile boyfriend. Well, Cher never actually dated anyone like Warner (Matthew Davis), a smarmy graduating senior who's headed to Harvard Law. And, for that matter, Reese-as-Elle doesn't have him for long either. The movie's first sequence, which promises more fun than it ever afterward delivers, finds Elle primping for what she thinks is a wedding proposal date, only to find herself dumped and mascara-streaked, walking home from a high-powered restaurant. ""Get in the car,"" Warner pleads, as Reese-as-Elle dejectedly drags herself home, though she proudly refuses, citing her need to separate herself, her integrity, etc. ""You'll ruin your shoes,"" he reminds her. She hops in. It is not clear if Elle is superficial, or if we are to take her as refreshingly, unneurotically honest about taking care of things she likes, such as her shoes. Certainly the rest of the movie doesn't clear this up. And yes, I can hear you bristling, and yes, I realize thatÊLegally BlondeÊis not a movie aiming for psychological realism. I do not expect that Reese Witherspoon ""inhabit"" this character, or that she do sense memory exercises and know what Elle would have for breakfast, or what her greatest fear might be. However: the rest of the movie follows Reese-as-Elle to Harvard, where she is determined to prove herself worthy of Warner's love. (He has dumped her because he feels she will not be an asset in impressing voters during future political campaigns.) The fact that Elle scores triumphantly on the LSATs implies that she actuallyÊisÊsmart, and that Warner underestimates her. The fact that she sends the Harvard admissions committee a tape of herself in a bikini, sweet-talking them from a whirlpool, suggests that her virtues lie elsewhere than her intellect, even though it's clear throughout that she's a perfectly nice girl who is certainly overqualified for the smug Warner. Then she gets to Harvard and says nothing but stupid things. Then a professor, played by Victor Garber (who wished he'd built Rose a better ship inÊTitanic), sees an intellectual spark in Elle that he doesn't see in others, so maybe she's a brain after all; he hires her as an intern. Then, she spends most of the time in their board meetings talking about Delta Nu social history. Back and forth, back and forth, the movie wobbles among three perspectives about Elle: that she is way smarter than anyone thinks, and they don't notice becauseÊtheyÊare superficial; that she is not a genius but has sincerity and common sense, which are better than intelligence; and that she lacks both an IQ and a basic understanding of human behavior and communication, but that's okay, because it's just important that people be nice. In other words, she is either Alicia Silverstone inÊClueless, Julia Roberts inÊPretty Woman, or Tom Hanks inÊForrest Gump, albeit with better hair. These are not difficult choices: any of these characterizations is fairly easy to accomplish, and once established, any number of enjoyable movies has taken off from their foundations. ButÊLegally BlondeÊjust can't make up its mind; in fact, it doesn't seem aware that it's obligated to have a mind about anything. First-time director Robert Luketic almost seems to enjoy tinkering with a pattern that was never broken, making all of the contrary decisions that can turn what is essentially cut-and-dried into a movie that has to scramble to stay coherent. A subplot about sexual propositioning gets thrown in with the same ""Why not?"" aplomb as a sudden choreographed routine led by Reese-as-Elle inside her favorite manicure salon (sort of like when all those women started dancing to Holly Hunter's lead inÊLiving Out Loud). The one character who is nice to Elle in her New England environs, a manicurist named Paulette and played byÊBest in Show's riotous Jennifer Coolidge, is cruelly lit and costumed to look as shopworn as possible. By contrast, the one character to which the film allows itself to be utterly unsympatheticÑWarner's new fiance, Vivian (Selma Blair)Ñis incongruously allowed a change of heart, because really, it's not fair to make a character despicable just because she's brunette and wears headbands. Vivian's benighted brunetteness is just the first of many sad gusts that air-bubble movies likeÊLegally BlondeÊeventually start coasting along to their irrelevant finish. Others include: 1) People with foreign accents are funny, as are gays; 2) If you think brunette is bad, havingÊcurlyÊbrunette hair is way worse; and, 3) Just when you've learned the lesson that a girl shouldn't have to define herself against some dumb man, we are assured in an inevitable final scene that she may now safely define herself against some kind-of-nice man. Jesus, people. If John Waters had been around to direct this thing, it might have had a shot. As is, the film wants to be both John Hughes and John Waters, failing to understand that the twain shall never meet. What savesÊLegally BlondeÊand makes it disappointingly mediocre instead of annoyingly coy and offensive is that Reese-as-ElleÑwhom, by the way, Reese brings off with some charmÑis not required to Learn a Very Valuable Lesson, nor isÊLegally BlondeÊat any point suggestive that it is secretly a Very Important Film. It lacks that ounce of pretension, to quote Dolly Parton inÊSteel Magnolias, that can make a real pound of manure: for negative comparison from this year alone, see the so-sure-it's-hipÊThe MexicanÊor the so-sure-it's-progressiveÊThe Brothers.ÊLegally BlondeÊmay not know what it's doing half the time, but it at least seems reconciled to its own silliness. And it does contain one fantastic retort, which I don't mind reproducing, because then you don't have to see the movie: when Elle, through massive cyclones of legalese, wins back Paulette's dog from her estranged husband, the young lawyer chirps, ""He's still scratching his head!"", to which Paulette answers, ""Yeah, must be a nice vacation for his balls."" Or maybe you had to be there. In any case, it pales by comparison to the best retort I heardÊaboutÊthe movie. When Elle, victorious (surprise!), exits through the courtroom doors, and Luketic grandiosely dissolves her into a blinding field of white light, my friend Amanda sharply inquired, ""Did she justÊdie?"" In one respect, at least, I hope she did, since I doubt the world is ready forÊLegally Blonder. Unless John Waters isn't busy.",DWB_Doc2_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
132,DWB_Doc3_LegallyBlonde,"Say all you will about the animated Dr. Aki Ross inÊFinal Fantasy, no computer character will ever be able to live up to the magic of Reese Witherspoon. From her breakthrough as the superbad Vanessa Lutz in the cool crime B-movieÊFreewayÊ(1996) to her persnickety perfectionist Tracey Flick in the brilliantÊElectionÊ(1999), she's created a gallery of strong characters; funny, potent, nasty, sweet, demure, conniving, and lovely. The only thing she's never been is passive or helpless. In addition, her script choices have rarely failed. Bookended with those two neo-classics, she fills her resume with: Robert Benton's underratedÊTwilight,ÊCruel Intentions,ÊPleasntville, the straight-to-video crime flickÊBest Laid PlansÊthat was better than its distributor gave it credit for, Mary Harron's wickedÊAmerican Psycho, and even a clever cameo in the otherwise forgettableÊLittle Nicky. She's also recently grown into her face -- with its strong, protruding chin and cheekbones -- turning from a baby into a beautiful movie star. Her turn inÊLittle NickyÊrequired her to spoof a bubble-headed blonde, and she did it brilliantly. It's no surprise that Hollywood came knocking, asking her to reprise a similar character for a starring role. And, not surprisingly, what worked in the cameo doesn't work full time. Witherspoon does her best here, which is superb (in one scene, a housemate sprays her with perfume and the way she moves her neck to catch every drop is enchanting). But the director and script ofÊLegally BlondeÊcan't be bothered to support her with material worthy of her cleverness and instinct. Written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (10 Things I Hate About You) and directed by first-timer Robert Luketic, the film begins with a one-line situation comedy joke: bubbleheaded blonde enrolls in Harvard Law School to win back her boyfriend (Matthew Davis). The catch is, of course, that Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is far smarter than anyone gives her credit for. In an early scene, a saleswoman tries to dispose of an overpriced dress on Elle, but Elle knows more than she lets on and double-whammies the saleswoman. So the movie's two jokes, repeated over and over, consist of Elle proving that she's smarter than people think, and Elle sticking out like a sore thumb among the hallowed walls of Harvard. A couple of these struck me funny: Elle's fuzzy pink phone, and her little Chihuahua, Bruiser, sitting under a hair dryer in a beauty parlor (unfortunately, this dog is the subject of nine or ten similar jokes, which quickly grow tiresome). Most of the others did not. Predictably, Elle meets someone better than her beloved, third-year law student Emmett, played by the enormously likable Luke Wilson, whose down-home charm beats out an army of generic boy-hunks like Davis. Along with Emmett, Elle's ex-boyfriend, and his new girlfriend (Selma Blair, also inÊCruel Intentions), Elle ends up on an actual murder trial, the ending of which is not hard to figure out. Any fish-out-of-water story like this has plenty of potential to work. For example, the movie could have played more with the cultural significance of blondeness, and the restrictions and advantages thereof. But Hollywood is content sticking with the easy, conventional fish-out-of-water formula established years ago.ÊLegally BlondeÊhad the responsibility, the obligation, to be clever enough to deserve Reese Witherspoon, and it fails.",DWB_Doc3_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
133,DWB_Doc4_LegallyBlonde,"Reese Witherspoon is just 25 years old, but she's been making a major impression on moviegoers for a full decade now. High points of her career include the offbeat ""Pleasantville,"" where she played a time-traveling teen caught in the 1950s, and the excellent ""Election,"" in which she gave an Oscar-worthy performance as an overachieving high-school student with a very nasty streak. I looked forward to her latest opus, ""Legally Blonde,"" because it sounded like a follow-up to ""Election,"" the best summer comedy in recent memory. Witherspoon plays the golden-haired heroine, Elle Woods, a graduating senior who's convinced that her boyfriend, Warner, will propose to her before heading off to law school in the fall. Warner does pop a question, but instead of the one she expected, it's more along the lines of, ""Don't you think we should break up?"" What breaks is Elle's heart, and if she were as ditsy as her sorority sisters, she'd spend the foreseeable future moaning and moping. She's a fighter, though, and before long she's settled on a more constructive course of action: She'll scuttle her other plans, apply to Warner's law school, and continue their courtship on his own turf, whether he wants to or not. One doesn't expect deep intelligence from a warm-weather Hollywood romance, but ""Legally Blonde"" has enough plot holes to drive Warner's snazzy sedan through. If Elle's so smart, why does she behave like a bubblehead? If she's a bubblehead, how can she ace the law boards on a moment's notice? Why would Harvard Law School want the likes of her and Warner in the first place? To be fair, ""Legally Blonde"" answers some of these questions. For example, Elle supports her Harvard application with a video essay directed by someone named Coppola and featuring Elle in a bikini. We even see the admissions committee making its decision to accept her, and here the movie has a welcome hint of satire - suggesting that the Ivy League is run by male aristocrats who are surefire suckers for a beautiful babe. Such biting moments are few, though. Most of ""Legally Blonde"" is mere sitcom-style farce, culminating in a music-and-dance number that's as awkward and embarrassing as any scene I've watched in months. Witherspoon fills the screen with bright-eyed bounce, but the picture has little else to recommend it. There oughta be a law! Based on all the media-hewn backslapping over Reese Witherspoon's first shotÊat a leading lady role, you'd think ""Legally Blonde"" was a modern BillyÊWilder comedy with the latest rendition of Marilyn Monroe in front of theÊcamera. Instead this weak and predictable comedy, by debut feature directorÊRobert Luketic, is a poorly lit attempt at dredging humor from a sterile andÊflat script. While Witherspoon makes an attractive ditzy blonde with enoughÊbook-smarts to overcompensate for her character's fashion victim obsessions,Êher talents are dissipated in a movie that chases its own tail. FollowingÊWitherspoon's cruelly good performances in movies like ""Freeway"" andÊ""Election,"" ""Legally Blonde"" is a career misstep for a talented actressÊcapable of creating much more complex characters.ÊYou gotta hand it to Reese Witherspoon. I can't think of many actresses who could carry a movie whose only attribute is its own vacuousness. She nearly does it.",DWB_Doc4_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
134,DWB_Doc5_LegallyBlonde,"Legally Blonde, a hefty handful of funny jokes notwithstanding, lacks a pleasing shapeliness. But you can't say the same thing about its star, Reese Witherspoon: Her sophisticated-pixie brilliance practically makes the movie, and her easy, confident, curvaceous carriage doesn't hurt, either -- she's the thinking guy's cupcake, maybe because her mind is just as supple as her curves. When, as Beverly Hills-bred sorority girl Elle Woods, she shows up for her first day at Harvard Law School in a trim-fitting ensemble of pink pearlized leather, the only appropriate response is a heart-shaped sigh. If it's possible to play the essence of a perfume cloud -- an '80s classic like Yves St. Laurent's ""Opium,"" let's say -- Witherspoon does it in ""Legally Blonde."" When we first meet Reese's blond glamour-cutie Elle Woods it's the end of her senior year in college, and she's eagerly awaiting the ring and marriage proposal that she's sure her handsome, dull boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) is about to deliver. He doesn't come through: He's on his way to law school, and he's hoping for a career in politics. ""If I'm going to be a senator, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn,"" he explains matter-of-factly, delivering the line more to Elle's plunging neckline than to her face. First heartbroken, then determined, Elle decides that the best way to get Warner back is to get into law school herself. She has a 4.0 grade point average -- so what if it's in fashion merchandising? She puts on a sequined bikini for her admissions video, and somehow the old codgers at Harvard decide she might just be a complementary addition to their hallowed halls. When she arrives on campus, though, she realizes that no one takes her seriously because of the way she looks, least of all the haughty brunet prep Vivian Kensington (played by the marvelous Selma Blair), who, much to Elle's horror, has stolen Warner away over the summer. That means war: Elle sets out to prove her snooty classmates wrong and get her boyfriend back. The opening scenes of ""Legally Blonde"" (directed by Robert Luketic, making his feature debut) vibrate with a bubble-gum pink glow, and their cartoonishness is exhilarating. We see Elle in her sorority house, surrounded by a gaggle of giggling sisters, getting ready for her big date with Warner: None of these women are exactly rocket scientists, but Luketic doesn't hurl cheap jokes at them so much as bounce gags off them with a gentle ping. When it comes to humor, Luketic has a nice touch. He knows how to frame individual jokes so they're like little jewels. There's one particularly brilliant one-liner delivered by the always-funny Jennifer Coolidge (perhaps best remembered as Stiffler's mom inÊ""American Pie"")Êas Paulette, a friend the depressed Elle makes at a beauty parlor far outside the tweedy, upper-crusty confines of Harvard Square. I won't give it away here, but Coolidge delivers the joke with such offhanded insouciance that it seems to take a quick whirl around the movie theater before it swings back to zonk you. It's like a trick bullet, and it's killer. The movie ambles along amiably enough, and there's a heartbeat of intelligence pulsing beneath Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's script (adapted from a novel by Amanda Brown). ""Legally Blonde"" shows a fair amount of perceptiveness about class issues. Even though Elle has as much money as her Harvard classmates (or more), with her love for flashy, ultrafashionable outfits and candy-colored manicures, she fits in better with the working-class girls she meets at the beauty parlor. And the movie isn't afraid to send up the drabness of Ivy League academia -- that of Harvard, in particular. Anybody who's ever spent 30 minutes in Cambridge's Harvard Square will instantly recognize the ""I'm smart and possibly very rich, but I'm still going to wear this pilly poncho around campus as a symbol of my earnestness and rejection of bourgeois values"" look of the students in ""Legally Blonde."" They're cartoons, of course, just as Elle is a cartoon, but that's what makes ""Legally Blonde"" fun. The bad news is, the movie starts heading nowhere after the first half-hour, and careers and flounders badly until it gets there. Too many superb actors -- in particular, Holland Taylor, as a tough-nuts Harvard professor, and Victor Garber, as the professor who first picks up on glimmers of Elle's intelligence -- are wasted. There are numerous subthreads in the story that are simply left hanging, undeveloped. And Luke Wilson, so unassumingly funny inÊ""Home Fries""ÊandÊ""Charlie's Angels,""Êsupposedly plays Elle's love interest here, but we don't get to see the romance unfold. But even after it becomes clear that ""Legally Blonde"" is headed nowhere fast, there's always Witherspoon and her winsome Chihuahua Bruiser. The two are inseparable, and even wear matching Tiffany heart necklaces. Witherspoon, with that acorn-shaped Kewpie doll face, has always been a charmer. But the real key to her appeal is that inside, she's tough as old boots, and here, as well as in pictures likeÊ""Freeway""ÊandÊ""Election,""Êshe's not afraid to show it. Witherspoon plays Elle with a squinty determination that's both devilishly funny and endearing. She delineates Elle's character beautifully just in the way she takes notes on her first day of class: Eyes round and alert, mouth set in a hard hyphen of concentration, she occasionally turns her attention to her heart-shaped note pad, where she scribbles away with a fluffy pink feather pen. Witherspoon telegraphs Elle's sense of justice and outrage with just enough of a broad twang: ""Whoever said orange was the 'new pink' was seriously disturbed."" If Witherspoon could be summed up as a color,Êshe'dÊbe the new pink. I doubt she'll ever be anything as garish and unbecoming as orange.",DWB_Doc5_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
135,DWB_Doc6_LegallyBlonde,"If her dazzling turns inÊElection, Freeway,ÊandÊThe Man in the MoonÊwerenÕt enough to convince you that Reese Witherspoon is one of her generationÕs greatest actresses,ÊLegally BlondeÊwill close the deal. A showcase for WitherspoonÕs dead-on comic timing, this new comedy is a slight and airy confection just perfect for the no-brainer summer months.Ê Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, an L.A. college senior whoÕs ostensibly a fashion merchandising major, but her real goal is to become the wife of Warner Huntington III (TigerlandÕs Matthew Davis). When Warner abruptly dumps herÑtelling Elle that as a future senator he needs to Òmarry a Jackie, not a MarilynÓÑElle conspires to win him back by following him to Harvard Law School and impressing him with her smarts. And how can Harvard resist ElleÕs hilarious video essay, in which she wears a spangled bikini and explains her qualifications for being a lawyer?Ê Getting in to the school is one thing, but actually going to class and facing the professors (including a hilariously hard-ass Holland Taylor) is something else entirely. Spurred by rivalry with WarnerÕs preppette fiance Vivian (Selma Blair), Elle buckles down and starts making the grades, catching the eye of a professor (Victor Garber) who assigns her to help out with a murder case involving an exercise guru (Ali Larter) who, as luck would have it, is a sorority sister of ElleÕs.Ê Legally BlondeÊhas been getting lots of comparisons toÊCluelessÊbecause of its bimbo-with-a-brain heroine, but the film plays more likeÊPrivate BenjaminÑspoiled girl enters august institution for the wrong reasons, then rises to the occasion and develops character in adversityÑwith a dash ofÊThe Paper ChaseÊthrown in for good measure. Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (10 Things I Hate About You) keep things zippy with one-liners like ÒLast week I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.Ó ThereÕs plenty here for gay audiences to chew on as well, from Meredith Scott LynnÕs amusingly earnest dyke Enid (who recalls her undergrad organizing of the Lesbians Against Drunk Driving march as Ògood timesÓ) to the queer twists of the murder trial (involving designer shoes and a Cher tape).Ê Alas, first-time director Robert Luketic (director of the award-winning shortÊTitsiana Booberini) isnÕt always up to the task here: Once you get past ElleÕs dazzlingly dippy wardrobe (and her pink, faux-fur-covered phone), the movie doesnÕt have the visual oomph that this sort of comedy demands. ThereÕs also a big sequence involving Elle teaching her manicurist pal (Best in ShowÕs Jennifer Coolidge) and a salon full of ladies (and male hairdressers) how to do the flirty Òbend and snapÓ move, but the cameraÕs never exactly where it ought to be to make this scene zing the way it should.Ê Still, this is WitherspoonÕs show all the way, and she never disappoints, finding both the hilarity and the backbone of this unlikely creature. And for those so inclined, itÕs a movie with a message: ÒYou need to have a little more faith in people,Ó Elle tells a hunky lawyer (Luke Wilson), Òyou might be surprised.Ó All of the filmÕs sympathetic characters learn to look past appearances, whether itÕs Enid having her assumptions about ElleÕs homophobia boomerang back at her or Elle learning that maybe Vivian doesnÕt have to be her bitter enemy.Ê Legally BlondeÊis the kind of fun fluffball thatÕs going to be playing on a lot of airplanes someday (once they all wear out their copies ofÊMiss Congeniality), but given the slim pickings of this summerÕs big movies, itÕs a great excuse for knocking back some Jujubes and watching Reese Witherspoon do that voodoo that she do so well.",DWB_Doc6_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
136,DWB_Doc7_LegallyBlonde,"Written by Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz (Ò10 Things I Hate About YouÓ) and directed by Robert Luketic in his first major screen outing, ÒLegally BlondeÓ is the ÒfictionalÓ tale of Elle Woods, Delta Nu sorority girl at ÒfictionalÓ California University at Los Angeles, home to the privileged and beautiful. Charming and eternally effervescent as the way cool, way blonde, Bel Air bubblehead who Òlives across the street from Aaron Spelling,Ó Reese Witherspoon gives an enchanting performance as Elle. With a major in fashion, Elle maintains her perfect 4.0 grade point average despite such heavy hitter classes such as ÒThe History of Polka Dots,Ó not to mention the never-ending needs of her sorority sisters for constant counseling on hair care, grooming, make-up, fashion and accessorizing. Certain that the man of her dreams, the well-to-do Warner Huntington III played by Matthew Davis, is going to propose to her (after all, why else would one go to college but to find a husband), Elle prepares for the big night with all the pomp and preparation generally reserved for a prom or in ElleÕs case, a debutante ball. Unfortunately, as Warner plans to become a senator by the time heÕs 30, he dumps Elle, explaining his decision with, ÒI need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.Ó Determined to reclaim her man, Elle decides to follow him to Harvard Law School and dazzle him with her intellect, despite her martini-drinking fatherÕs belief that law school is only for Òboring, ugly and seriousÓ people. With an admissions video directed by Coppola, the staid and stoic Harvard admissions committee accepts Elle to Harvard on the grounds of Òdiversity.Ó Arriving in her trademark cloud of pink, Elle and her always fashionable Chihuahua, Bruiser, stick out like sore thumbs in the mundane preppie community. Snubbed and ridiculed by fellow classmates, chastised by Professor Stromwell on day one due to lack of preparation (ÒI didnÕt know we had homeworkÓ) and all hopes for marriage dashed when Warner announces heÕs engaged to fellow preppie Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair), Elle is ready to call it quits. However, when she goes in search of much needed comfort and therapy in the form of a manicure and pedicure, her spirit is restored by manicurist-turned- confidante, Paulette, comically played by Jennifer Coolidge, who pushes Elle back into the ring with new determination. Adding to ElleÕs reinvigorated self-confidence is Emmett Richmond, played by Tom Cruise look-alike, Luke Wilson, who always exudes quiet handsomeness and smoldering sex appeal. Emmett, an associate attorney for criminal defense attorney and law professor Callahan, and obviously very smitten with Elle, subtlely encourages her at every turn and prods her to vie for one of the internships offered by CallahanÕs law firm. Due to the intricacies and demands of defending fitness guru and former Delta Nu, Brooke Taylor Windham (played by Ali Larter) who is accused of murdering her much older and very rich husband, Callahan brings in several students to intern on the case, one of which is our girl Elle. Relying on her Delta Nu sisterhood, as well as her extraordinary grooming and fashion talents, Elle believes in BrookeÕs innocence and sets out to prove same. With an alibi that canÕt be disclosed, and a defense based on pool boys in thongs, Prada shoes and perms, comedy abounds. All thatÕs missing in the climactic courtroom scene is Johnny Cochran at the counsel table! Arguably one of the best across-the-board cast films this year, strong performances are turned in by all. WitherspoonÕs energetic performance is delightful. The incomparable Holland Taylor as Professor Stromwell, brings the same realism, believability and no-nonsense approach to the classroom as she does to her courtroom as Judge Roberta Kittleston on ÒThe Practice.Ó An absolute joy to watch! Victor Garber, recently seen as Sid Luft in ÒThe Judy Garland StoryÓ and probably best known as Titanic architect, Thomas Andrews, gives another impressively dimensional performance as Professor Callahan. And of course, no one can play a haughty socialite like Raquel Welch who is just splendid here as Mrs. Windham Vandermark. Likable. Enjoyable. Funny. Entertaining. YouÕll smile. YouÕll laugh.

137,DWB_Doc8_LegallyBlonde,"It's not that easy to simultaneously make fun of something and celebrate it, especially when that something is blonde, beautiful, breezy, and comes from Southern California. Amy Heckerling pulled it off perfectly inÊClueless, and Peyton Reed did a pretty handy job withÊBring It On. But the first director to take this self-aware ""genre"" of cute, clever films beyond high school is Robert Luketic. HisÊLegally BlondeÊis the ultimate cotton candy movie Ñ it's sweet, it's fluffy, and, boy, is it pink. Saying this is a good movie may not sound like much, but after watching all the other summer movies, this is a breath of fresh air. Reese Witherspoon is proving to be one of the best young actors of our time and she makes this movie something fun to see. Reese Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, a Manolo Blahnik-wearing, tiny dog-toting, perfectly coiffed sorority sweetheart who is unceremoniously dumped by her Harvard Law-bound boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis); seems ol' Warner wants someone a little more serious than Elle on his arm when he hits the East Coast (in his words, ""I need a Jackie, not a Marilyn""). Determined to prove that she's just as brainy and sober as the preppiest prep school girl, Elle decides to go to law school too, and one sequined, suntanned admissions video later, she's on her way. But when she waltzes into Harvard, she promptly finds her popular, sunny self universally despised by the other snobby, over-achieving law students Ñ including Warner's new brunette fianc, Vivian (Selma Blair). Rather than head back to the land of sunshine, Elle sticks with it and ultimately shows that not only do blondes have more fun, but they also kick butt in the courtroom (and attract adorable associates like Luke Wilson's Emmett). Witherspoon is a perfect match for the sharp script from Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (based on the novel by Amanda Brown); in herÊElection-honed hands, Elle's chipper smile and chirpy voice are much more than the outer trappings of a stereotypical sorority girl. Witherspoon makes it clear that Elle is a girl whose heart is as gold as her hair; she's sweet, polite, and friendly, and she just doesn't understand why the Harvardites can't see beyond her fashion sense and perfect accessories to the smart, savvy girl she really is. MGM offers a special edition DVD ofÊLegally BlondeÊthat's as well-equipped as its heroine: The two-sided disc features a strong 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer (a standard version is also available); crisp, clean Dolby Digital 5.1 audio (other sound options include Spanish and French stereo, and English, French, and Spanish subtitles); and a fab collection of extras. Side one offers two full-length commentaries: The first a pleasantly chatty outing with Luketic, Witherspoon, and producer Marc Platt, the second a pastiche of short segments from six different crew members, including the screenwriters. Also available on side one of the disc is one of those increasingly popular ""pop-up movie"" trivia tracks. Flip the DVD over for the rest of the goodies: eight deleted scenes, a 21-minute ""InsideÊLegally Blonde"" making-of documentary, a nine-minute featurette called ""The Hair that Ate Hollywood,"" a music video for Hoku's ""Perfect Day,"" and trailers.

138,DWB_Doc9_LegallyBlonde,"I didn't go into ""Legally Blonde"" expecting too much. I rarely go to actual movie theaters to see a film (I usually rent videos/DVDs), but I got an advance on this one, and I was kind of sad it had to be this film I was going to see, but I had been invited along with two other people to see it and I wasn't going to say ""no"" for no reason. So I went. One of the persons I went with just wanted to see Reese Witherspoon in a Playboy bunny costume, so I figured I was in for another average run-'o-the-mill sex comedy. But I was very surprised with the outcome. So many girl-power comedies these days are made just for the sake of trying to prove a point that women are equals to men (I suppose that's the message behind it--what else was ""Now and Then"" made for?) and/or support for women. Fortunately, the 2001 hit ""Legally Blonde"" is not only a pleasant surprise, but an intelligent film, as well. (Sorry, that was my main ""gripper"" for this review and I had to leave it in.) Reese Witherspoon plays California sorority girl Elle Woods. Unlike other people her age that are worrying about grades in school, Elle only worries about what toilet paper is the softest. But after her boyfriend dumps her and goes off to Harvard Law School, Elle is determined to go to Harvard and get her man back. So after putting together a very shallow video for the chairmen of Harvard, they accept her into the prestige college (because of her innocent sexuality, no doubt, as we see them gaping at Elle in a bathing suit on the video), and she packs her bags and heads off to Harvard with her little dog Bruiser; as the ads say, ""Boldly Going Where No Blonde Has Gone."" ""Legally Blonde"" doesn't give up on the plot and completely divulge into dumb blonde/sex jokes. This film not only has a funny--if ridiculous--plot, but the jokes are, surprisingly, NOT crude sexual jokes. This film is not another ""Scary Movie"" made for teens: It has divinely orchestrated comic timing. Sometimes the plot gets a bit too heavy--the whole teacher-hitting-on-Elle thing is a bit stereotypical for a film like this--but in the long run it seems to break away from the typical girl-power comedy. Reese Witherspoon tends to play the same characters a lot, but hey, if she can pull them off, good for her. I don't mind if all her characters tend to be the same (to a certain extent) because they tend to be quite funny and cute--who can't laugh at her Elle Woods persona? The film has a very nice co-star cast: Victor Garber (""Titanic,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle""), Luke Wilson (""Blue Streak,"" ""Charlie's Angels""), and Selma Blair (""The Sweetest Thing,"" A Guy Thing""--pretty much anyTHING).

139,DWB_Doc10_LegallyBlonde,"Don't judge a book by it's cover. An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore. But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again. In fact, let me help you: Don't judge a book by it's cover. There. Now take a moment to think, really think about it. And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon. The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School. Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have. It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight. Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite. So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why. She's devastated. But she's also smart. Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner. But along the way she learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well. And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is. And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her. Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times. But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin. Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain `mold,' or coincide with someone else's `opinions' of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation. And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her. At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you. Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion? So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; `dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well. Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her. And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation. On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well. And it makes you root for her all the more. Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person. When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground. There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career. The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark. An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, `Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature. Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them. What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships. It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.Ê",DWB_Doc10_LegallyBlonde,DWB,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
60,KKN_Doc1_ToxicAvenger,"This film believe or not is one of my favorate films of all time, it's also kinda another one of my childhood gems, well more like my teen gems, I'll explain.

It kinda was a gradual build for me, I first discovered this franshise from the cartoon show ""Toxic Crusaders"" which I thought was cool and I didn't even know at the time this was loosely inspired/based on the movie ""The Toxic Avenger"". I didn't see this film until I lot latter when I was a teenager about 16 and I'll admit it blew me away it wasn't entirely what I was expecting but that what made it all the better as it was outrageously fun and funny; watching it now as an adult is even more fun and funner than before. It's also one of the films that actually inspired me, yes I'm not kidding in writing and getting into the entertainment business.

This film to me really turned things on their head let alone turned up the notch on violence, effects, comidy, and the superhero genere up to 11. The content and wild expressionism in this film wasn't common place at the time, it was defenantly before some of the TV shows ""South Park"", ""The Simpsons"" which are just as nuts, and that's part of what made the film great for me because it wasn't afraid of being what it wanted fun while doing what it wanted.

This film was made on a low budget but I felt it was money well spent just showing that you can still make a good fun film despite limitations; as opposed to most big budget film where some tend to disappoint because they forgot one curcial element fun.

The music is great it's one of my favorate movie soundtracks I really like the song ""Body Talk"" which is a catchy tune and a fun one to use if you ever want to do aerobics or fitness training.

This film of course were in it for the action and comidy and like any well done floor it shines on both.

The comidy is great the whole thing plays out like a live action Mad Magazine cartoon, it's rich in both verbal and visual humor. I also feel has a bit of replay value because sometimes watching this again I can pick up on more jokes that might have flied over me.

The characters are fun, everyone in Tromaville are kinda live action Mad Magazine characters because not everyone is totally normal there is always something unusal about them or are just crazy. From villain despite unlikeable which is the point their still funny, like Cigarface as well as the two health club bullies Slug and Bozo whom are all true to their names, let alone the fact Bozo has got some real impulse problems as he gets easily stressed and angry over the smallest or stupidest thing, it cracks me up whenever he blows up.

And Toxic/Melvin whom is a soild superhero. I really love the makeup design on him where he's ugly but actually plesent looking. The voice is great as it perfectly fits whom he is strong and authoritative, but also a bit quirky. But the funny thing about him is he's the only person in Tromaville that is actually sane which makes him sort of the straight man in the film. But what I really like about him is how acessable a hero he is as he's more of a local, he doesn't go to some Justice League or Avengers whom are always too busy fighting big threats from somewhere and for some reason never having time for common ones which is weard despite their money and resources. He stays in town to help out whoever is in trouble doing the best he can to make his home liveable, he has no fancy weapons he uses whatever he has to his advantage making him resourceful. But also what I like is how thoughout the film from his actions he not just makes Tromaville safer but he creates a sense of community which to me is the underlying message in the film about the power of the individual and community .

I really like the use of satirical humor where it's pokes fun and is suttle in the subjects it's pointed out and underlined. From Pollution and how completely irresponsible and amoral companies are in handling hazadarious chemicals, thinking about how much money they'll make instead of the dire consequences they create. Urban crime and how not enough is being done because of corruption going on in the higher departments. As well as how powers that be trying to tyrannically control indiviuals and community.

The action is great, the fights are well chorigraphed and the gore effects are on par. I really like how before the action begins it's a suspenseful build as we see an innocent/innocent bystanders are in trouble one reason or another as they are being terrorized and even slaughtered by these really awful evil people and your thinking he's coming, he's coming any minute now. And then just when it gets down to the wire Toxie comes in and I just cheer because he's coming in to clean up the scum of the Earth.

One of my favorate battles of all time is the battle at the ""Taco Time"" like restarurant where he's battling this gang of three but has a martial arts one on one fight with one of them that takes out nunchus and even uses a katana. And of course the kills in this film are great the practical gore effects are top notch. The kills are creative, colorful, and a slight blackly comic edge sort of like Jason and his kills in the ""Friday the 13th"" films only difference is it's bad guys Toxie is killing whom all get what they deserve. My favorate kill is of course the legendary head crushing scene which in a way pertains to our subconscious fear of getting hurt or worse from exercise equipment.

Well I've said enough, ""The Toxic Avenger"" is messy fun.",KKN_Doc1_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
61,KKN_Doc2_ToxicAvenger,"When I was a teenager, the only available place to watch trash was on USA's Up All Night which showed their movies cut with just enough on screen to tease and tantalize. A trio of films appeared on USA which caught my attention, the Toxic Avenger series, and I was introduced to Troma. This was their flagship series, and it was rare that you'd find any other item as entertainingly zany, sick, and cheap as these films. Even close to these films were the Class of Nuke 'Em High movies which dealt with high school kids introduced to what toxic waste could do. But, in The Toxic Avenger, a geeky, buck-teethed janitor whose trusty mop was always by his side, ogling the bikini-clad aerobics gals who'd come to the gym he was employed to maintain their impressive bods, is the subject of what toxic waste can do to your anatomy when the skin and body are immersed in such chemicals..it can turn you into a grotesque superhero with amazing physique and martial arts skills, not to mention you can rip arms off and propel men in the air with ease. It all starts when four psychopaths, Slug(Robert Prichard), maniac Bozo(Gary Schneider), and their girlfriends, Wanda(Jennifer Prichard) and Julie(Cindy Manion)who frequent a gym wish to cause ""mop boy"" Melvin Junko(Mark Torgle)as much harm and humiliation as possible just for the hell of it. During their past time, these four enjoy driving over innocent people with Bozo's car, adding up points kind of like in the movie Death Race 2000. We see this when the four single out a kind little kid with a helmet riding his bike as they run him over before crushing his head under their back tire! They take Polaroids, for which gets the girls hot and bothered. Yep, this is not for the squeamish or those who demand films of good taste. Anyway, Julie prompts Melvin to slip on a pink tutu so that she can get all worked up for a little sex, setting the poor kid up for a cruel practical joke, concerning a lamb, with all the customers of the gym laughing their asses off at his expense. Tormented and crazed, Melvin throws himself through a window. What Melvin doesn't expect is to fall into a barrel of toxic waste placed inside a parked truck hauling the stuff to a nearby landfill. The toxic waste in turn transforms Melvin into a ghastly monster with a homing beacon towards evil. Anyone corrupt, gangsters, hoodlums, and crooked city officials, are targets of the Toxic Avenger. Three slimy thieves with weapons attempting to rob a taco store with an innocent bi-stander getting a shot-gun blast to the chest, a blind beauty's seeing-eye-dog also getting it right in the stomach, with our toxic superhero coming to save the day. He rips the leader's arm off before stuffing him into a stove, makes an ice-cream sundae out of another's face before driving a drill into his eye, and boiling the last criminal's hands in grease! A gang of mobster's thugs beating up a beat cop get their heads caved in by crushing blows while the third gets away momentarily before attempting to retaliate with more hoods carrying arsenal. This all takes place before Melvin can get his revenge against the four who ultimately wronged him the most. There's a loopy sub-plot featuring the love-affair between Toxie and a blind babe who talks with eyes WIDE open(..she's the one with the dog who got shot by the hoods in the taco store). And, the actual chief villain of the film is the corrupt mayor of Tromaville(..the humongous Pat Ryan)who works behind the scenes with the villainous scum behind the crime of the city. He wants Toxie dead for the heroic monster is bad for business.

Obviously, this includes far more gratuitous material than was shown on USA many years ago, including boobs, gory violence, and ample profanity. There's a photo of the aftermath of the bicycle kid's brains all over the pavement, a crooked underling of the mayor gets his head smashed by a set of weights, and Toxie thrusts his fist into a stomach removing the guts. As you'd expect with a Troma film, the acting is(..intentionally) so rotten it's hostile to the eyes, the camera-work & editing are(..purposely)unprofessional, and the characters are(..obviously)written as farcical(..and dimwitted) as possible. Everything in the film is heightened to a great degree crying aloud..this is supposed to be as loud and warped and sophomoric as possible for the viewing enjoyment of those with an appreciation for trash. There's this little part of me that embraces a film like Toxic Avenger because I think it succeeds in what it sets out to do, and the crowd catered to get their money's worth. The film is basically a vehicle to shock and disgust and does so unabashedly.",KKN_Doc2_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
62,KKN_Doc3_ToxicAvenger,"I've never seen a Troma film before but I do remember watching the ""Toxic Crusaders"" cartoon as a child with a vague awareness that it was based on a movie. Something recently brought that cartoon to my attention again for the first time in decades and so I figured I'd dive into the movies from which the character originated. So, with no context whatsoever and only a passing familiarity with the sort of movies that built Troma's cult following, I ordered all four Toxic Avenger movies from Amazon. So it begins. THE TOXIC AVENGER isa movie. That much is true. It's not a great movie and I'm certain I could find countless people who might even call it total garbage, but I don't hate it. It's unapologetic, violent, crude, stupid, and filled to the brim with the most hateful of characters but I can still see some of the charm shining through. I have no qualms with bad movies. Movies can have shoddy production values, incomprehensible writing, and wooden acting but still find redemption in the spirit. THE TOXIC AVENGER has spirit to spare. It's a low, low budget horror/action/comedy from people who love making movies and have a certain creative spark when it comes to special effects. Let's face it, this movie hasn't got the depth of a $10 plastic kiddie pool but it accomplishes what it set out to do: to titillate, offend, gross you out and, most importantly, make you laugh. In this sense, TOXIC AVENGER succeeds.

As the movie opens, we're introduced to Tromaville. It's a cesspool of toxic waste dumping, political corruption, rampaging criminals, and a health club where everyone is just the worst. Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl) is the focus of everyone's hatred. The poor dork with the unfortunate face and dim wit is a mop boy under constant assault from the likes of Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard, who really looks like a ""That 70's Show"" era Ashton Kutcher). These aren't your average workout thugs either; when they're not torturing Melvin or sexing up their buxom girlfriends, their out running down pedestrians in their car and racking up points in their sick games. One afternoon, the punks formulate a plan to prank Melvin and it results in Melvin (in a pink tutu) going headfirst into a barrel of toxic waste. That toxic waste mutates Melvin into a scarred, hulking monster (Mitch Cohen) with a sixth sense for detecting evil. And when he detects evil, he has to clean it up. Because he's got a mop. Get it? So now Melvin, as this toxic monster, makes it his mission to violently murder Tromaville's criminals and get a little revenge in the process. He also finds love in the arms of the beautiful blind Sarah (Andree Maranda), whom he saves from certain death in a fast food robbery. And that's about it. Melvin transforms and we get a series of graphically violent murder scenes for about forty five minutes before the movie decides to wrap.

The writing is very, very simple and the dialogue is very, very stupid. These things are not the focus of a movie like THE TOXIC AVENGER. There isn't a natural, believable performance in the entire film. No one in this movie is expected to act. Everything about this movie is explosively over the top. Evil characters screech their lines with wide eyes and cackle maniacally, and the suffering civilians of Tromaville bemoan their situation with wrung hands and stumbled lines. Melvin announces his intentions as the town's new hero with stiff, poorly-dubbed heroic monologues. It's admirable that Troma's cult classic manages to squeeze through with what, structurally, can be considered a functional film. None of this matters though because THE TOXIC AVENGER is all about the craziness. We get crushed heads, disembowelment, dismemberment, and more. There's a shotgun pointed at an infant's face and a guide dog blown away in gory fashion. No one is safe. There're jokes aimed at fat people, homosexuals, and at least one little person shoved into an industrial clothes dryer. There's also plenty of gratuitous nudity because a movie like this isn't going to hold out on any front. Or ""anyone's"" front. Because there's a lot of breasts, see. THE TOXIC AVENGER is not for everyone. It's barely for me. I wouldn't have minded a stronger plot or better performances but I guess graphic shots of a child's head exploding under a car tire issomething. But it's got that spirit. These are people who knew what they were doing and they were having a real blast doing it. That's worth something, especially with a film like this where it wears that spirit on its sleeve.",KKN_Doc3_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
63,KKN_Doc4_ToxicAvenger,"Toxic Avenger 21st Anniversary Ed. 2 Disc Set 2005 (Unrated), Original Release 1986

Bullies torment innocent Melvin Junko, the janitor at a Health Club. After he falls into toxic waste, he returns to kill the evildoers as the Toxic Avenger. Along the way, he falls in love with a blind girl, angers citizens, and has the Mayor try to kill him.

The opening of the film has preachy narration about pollution and toxic waste, which would make an astute viewer think that Yale grad, Uncle Lloydy, was actually trying to say something here. The film has many scenes of violence and I can understand the controversy. But all of that is undercut by sheer lunacy and it is hard to take this seriously.

No one is off limits here: Blacks, Jews, Gays, children, the blind, obese people, the elderly, and midgets. There is even a gay gangster named Nipples. You will see a seeing eye dog shot, a blind girl almost raped, and an old lady beat to death by own her cane. Oh, and there was that young boy that was run over repeatedly while trying to crawl away for help. And that girl in the sauna? Yes, she is masturbating to pictures of the dead boy. Sadistic, enough?

The comedy is plentiful though. The first scenes with goofy Melvin and the bimbos and lugheads are hilarious. The theme song ""Body Talk"" had me singing along. And then there is the ""Healthy Troma"" billboard prominently displayed throughout the movie featuring a portly Mayor.

The one scene that was borderline difficult to watch was the restaurant hold up. The guy in the make-up looked like a scary clown and tormented the people innocently sitting there. He shoots the blind girl's seeing eye dog and his Black accomplice attempts to rape her. Of course, before things veer into really nasty territory, Toxie saves the day and lands himself a clumsy girlfriend that cooks with Draino.

The special effects are awesome considering there was no budget. I heard they used watermelons and spaghetti to make some of the effects, but I couldn't tell. Toxie sounded incredibly weird though. I thought maybe this was voice-over work done later since the actor was in make-up and couldn't move his face. Or maybe it was intentional. Either way it added to my enjoyment.

64,KKN_Doc5_ToxicAvenger,"The Toxic Avenger is an excellent and hilarious Horror Action Comedy Superhero film that combines,wonderful direction,a fun cast,over the top Comedy,thrilling Action,a great soundtrack and terrific special effects. All of those elements make The Toxic Avenger not only one of my favorite movies but also one of the all time great Cult Classics and Troma Entertainment at their best.

Set in the fictional town of Tromaville,New Jersey,The Toxic Avenger tells the story Melvin Junko(Mark Torgi),a 90-pound weakling that works as a Janitor at the Tromaville Gym and is always getting pushed around. When Melvin becomes the victim of a terrible prank,Melvin jumps out of a window into a barrel of Toxic waste turning Melvin into the most hideously deformed creature of Superhuman size and strength that protects the people becoming...The Toxic Avenger(Mitchell Cohen).

Before The Toxic Avenger,Troma Studios was(and still is)an independent studio company that produced low budget Sex Comedies such as Squeeze Play(1979),Waitress(1981),Stuck On You(1982)and The First Turn On!(1983)to little success. Then along came The Toxic Avenger,an amazing and over the top Horror Comedy Action Superhero film that became a Cult Classic that put Troma entertainment on the map and also spawning three sequels,a children's Cartoon series,a stage musical and gave movie audiences one of the most beloved Superheros of all time in The Toxic Avenger. In other words,Troma was the studio The Toxic Avenger built. The Toxic Avenger is a classic Horror Comedy,a great film and one of the goriest,bloodiest and most politically incorrect films of all time and is so depraved and twisted that I don't a major studio then and now would have made The Toxic Avenger the way it is. Only s company like Troma entertainment would have the guts to make film this way. The Comedy in The Toxic Avenger is hilarious,wild and over the top thanks to the characters and situations that happen in the movie and you as a viewer will be in tears laughing while at the same time being disgusted at some of the things you see which I think adds to the appeal and so bad it's good style of The Toxic Avenger. What also makes TTA so funny and over the top is the way the film tackles subjects in a offbeat style such as violence,sex,corrupt politicians,Gym Clubs,toxic waste dumping,criminals,drug use and more. No subject in this film is left untouched. While TTA is a Horror film the Horror doesn't come from the movie being scary because it's not,the Horror comes from the amounts of violence and gore that happens in the film. The blood and gore while not very serious and at times funny the gore is not for the weak at heart because the blood and gore comes fast and quick. For a movie that was made on a small budget,TTA has some really great and exciting Action and fight scenes that are thrilling and well executed while being played for laughs. There is also a terrific car chase scene that will remind viewers viewers of The French Connection,Mad Max Films and car chase movies of the 1970s. It's a car chase that is funny and unforgettable. The Toxic Avenger(or Toxie as he was later called in the sequels)is one of the all time great Superhero characters in films and beyond because he is a mixture and combination of other great Superheros such as Batman,Superman,Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk and like those four Superhero icons The Toxic Avenger is a crime fighter and wants to protect people from criminals and other bad things using his power and strength to get the bad guys. Also,like any other Superheros The Toxic Avenger is very complex having to deal with going from a 90 pound weakling to a Monster Hero of Superhuman size and strength,finding love with a blind girlfriend and trying to figure out what he's doing is right or wrong. The Toxic Avenger is a classic character you will never forget. The ending is amazing and memorable and adds to the legend of The Toxic Avenger and will have you smiling and cheering at the screen. A great conclusion.

The whole cast is wonderful(in a so bad it's good way). Mitchell Cohen is excellent as The Toxic Avenger,with Cohen bringing depth and great body language to the performance. Andree Maranda is wonderful as Sexy as Sara,The Toxic Avenger's blind girlfriend. Mark Torgl is funny and over the top as Melvin,The Toxic Avenger's alter ego. Jennifer Prichard and Cindy Manion are terrific and sexy as Wanda and Julie Slug and Bozo's girlfriends. Robert Prichard and Gary Schneider are funny and memorable as Slug and Bozo,Gym bullies. Pat Ryan Jr. is great Mayor Peter Goody,a corrupt politician. Dick Martinsen(Officer O'Clancy),Dan Snow,(Cigar Face),David N. Weiss(Chief Of Police),Sarabel Levinson(Melvin's Mom),Pat Klipatrick(Leroy),Larry Sulton(Frank)and Mike Russo(Rico)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by from Marisa Tomei(Heath Club Girl).

The direction by Lloyd Kaufman(as Samuel Weil)and Michael Herz is fantastic and memorable,with Kaufman and Herz bringing energy,style and keeping the film moving at a great pace. Fine direction by Kaufman and Hertz.

The soundtrack has great songs such as Body Talk(Sandra Farina),Is This Love and Nothing At All(Mark Hoffman And Race). Good soundtrack.

The special make-up effects by Jennifer Aspinall are fantastic,gory and realistic and truly add to the film. Wonderful make-up effects,Aspinall.

In final word,if you love Troma films,Horror films,Action movies,Cult Films,B-Movies,Superhero films,Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The Toxic Avenger,an excellent,hilarious and over the top Cult Classic that is Troma entertainment at it's very best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",KKN_Doc5_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
65,KKN_Doc6_ToxicAvenger,"I can say the most positive thing about The Toxic Avenger is that it knew what it was. Sure, it's a horrible, horrible, incredibly bad film, but at least unlike other top worst movies of all time, this one knew it was meant for B-Movie status. Or at least for some midnight views or drinking games.

For someone who has not seen a singe ""Troma"" film ever, until last night, I was pretty shocked on the lengths these directors and writers went. From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face. I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off. Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity.

Yeah, I mentioned some of the movie was fun. It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs. (Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.) I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie.

Nerdy, nerd, nerd Melvin's the janitor in charge of the mop at a gym and is getting picked on. Why? Because he's misunderstood? No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team. And he should honestly never be let out of his house for his own safety.

At any rate, he sort of works by mopping and goggling the bimbos until a plan is hatched to rid the gym of this eye sore by humiliation that turns into him leaping out of a window into, you guessed it, toxic waste. From there, this Frankenstein's Monster with a brand new voice and body seeks out justice for whatever reason you can think of. But, this is not a Batman vigilante. This one not only has no conscious of murder, he slaughters.

I could say this is where the movie gets silly, but that was from frame one. No, this is where is where the movie gets sick and turns more horror. Sure, there are more comedic, intentional or not, moments, but they layered on the gore and violence and some of the oddest characters lifted right from Garbage Pail Kids cards, and no, I'm not talking about mutated characters. These were the humans.

I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone other than the midnight-movie, drinking (or other forms of controlled substance) or lovers of bad movie groups. I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing.",KKN_Doc6_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
66,KKN_Doc7_ToxicAvenger,"The Toxic Avenger starts with a shot of the New York City skyline. A narration informs us that 'New York City, the worlds capital of culture & industry. Here, among the towering skyscraper's, civilisation is guided by men of progress & the wonders of technology. But for all this industrial advancement there is a price to pay. Pollution, the unavoidable byproduct of todays society, every year millions of gallons of poisonous wastes, garbage & radioactive chemicals are disposed of in nearby towns such as Tromaville the toxic waste dumping capital of the world. Our story takes place at the Tromaville health club where a young man named Melvin Furd (forget what the IMDb says, it's definitely Furd not Junko) works. Melvin's entire life, in fact entire being was changed by toxic chemical waste...' Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a real loser, nerd & all round wimp. Melvin is a mop boy at the the Tromaville health club & everyone makes fun of him, especially four local thugs named Bozo (Gary Schneider) his girlfriend Julie (Cindy Manion) plus Slug (Robert Prichard) & his girlfriend Wanda (Jennifer Prichard as Jennifer Babtist). One day the four decide to play a cruel practical joke on Melvin & humiliate him in front of as many people as possible. However things go wrong, or right depending on whichever way you look at it I suppose, & Melvin ends up head first in a barrel of hazardous toxic waste. As a consequence Melvin mutates into the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen as Mitchell Cohen), wow. After saving an Irish cop named Officer O'Clancy (Dick Martinsen) from a gang of three thugs, Cigarface (Dan Snow), Knuckles (Doug Isbecque) & Nipples (Charles Lee Jr.) Toxie discovers that he enjoyed being a hero & so decides to clean Tromaville up by single-handedly wiping out the evil forces which contaminate the town. Mayor Belgoody (Pat Ryan as Pat Ryan Jr.) is as bent as they come & starts to notice a drop in his profit margins from his illegal activity, he puts pressure on the Chief of police (David N. Weiss as David Weiss) to find the Toxic Avenger & kill him before Toxie finds & kills them...

Directed by Micheal Herz & Lloyd Kaufman as Samuel Weil I thought The Toxic Avenger was one seriously brain-dead film made for idiots by idiots, you can take that anyway you like considering that I actually quite liked it. The script by Joe Ritter is as stupid as you can imagine, this thing makes the Police Academy films (1984 - 94) look like the pinnacle of sophistication! The jokes are really dumb & moronic, furthermore it stretches the boundaries of acceptability & taste. The Toxic Avenger pokes fun at blind people, beating old ladies up, running children over & going back to crush their heads while later on in the film a woman masturbates over some photographs of the incident & putting a dwarf into a washing machine & turning it on. The sort of comedy you can expect in The Toxic Avenger isn't exactly classy either like someone putting a snake down a fitness instructors top & his class copying his silly movements as he tries to grab it or Toxie's blind girlfriend Sara (Andree Maranda) making him a sandwich filled with Draino. Subtle obviously isn't a word in director's Herz & Kaufman's vocabulary. There is some over-the-top violence & gore, a squashed head, ripped off arm, fried hands, shotgun blasted guide dogs, intestine ripping, beatings & a bit where a guy has his head crushed by some weights but it's all rather fake looking & presented in a slapstick sort of way. Tecnically The Toxic Avenger is awful, the acting is terrible as is the cinematography, editing as continuity obviously wasn't an important issue for the filmmakers & overall production values. There are some reasonable, if cheap looking, car stunts in a brief action sequence as well. Having said all that I did actually find some of it quite amusing (I'm not sure what that say's about me) & in a fun sort of way it, for the most part, works as a whole. It's very well paced, something is always happening whether it's an outrageous bad taste joke or just some good old fashioned violence & gore. I can't really recommend The Toxic Avenger as a good film but it did keep me entertained throughout & that's all I was hoping for, I mean I didn't expect high art, or an educational thought provoking study of modern society did I?! Fun, but an acquired taste & only for those with the stomach.",KKN_Doc7_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
67,KKN_Doc8_ToxicAvenger,"I have to force myself not to give this movie anything lower than a 5/10, though I'm very tempted to. The reason I'm forcing myself not to be so pessimistic is because I respect this movie a lot more than I liked it. Why? Because there is absolutely nothing here that is more off-the-wall than ""serious"" (aka: cheesy) horror films from the general time period, but The Toxic Avenger is a comedy rather than a ""serious"" horror film. And quite honestly, I've never seen very many horror-comedies that were actually funny, but The Toxic Avenger IS actually funny. Almost going hand-in-hand, the pure audacity this movie has makes every other horror release in its time look downright PG. The gore took the politically incorrect spin to a new level in the '80s, and without The Toxic Avenger I simply don't know if the uber-violent movies of today would even exist. It took things to a new level. It TRIED to offend people, for the first time since the birth of the horror film. Even today, I can't name very many movies that have this much audacity. For that I respect The Toxic Avenger.

But, maybe it's just a matter of taste, I just didn't see this movie as very entertaining. I think it's one of those movies you had to grow up on as a kid to love as an adult, because I just didn't see a whole lot in it in 2008. I guess this is because I've seen countless imitators and rip-offs that I'm desensitized to what was a very original idea in '85. I don't know. I just didn't find as much entertainment value in it as I thought I would.

On a technical level, the movie accomplishes the mess that it tries to accomplish. The music is catchy and sometimes funny. Some of the plot points are laugh-out-loud awesome. The gore effects and amount of gore are both nothing compared to those of today, but follow suit with the so-bad-it's-good feel. Everything reeks of '80s, and why shouldn't it? The Toxic Avenger isn't a timeless movie: it was made for one generation, and other generations typically won't get it the way those in the '80s got it. It's like a car, it depreciates in value as soon as it's released. It's never the same as it was when it first came out to a modern mind, because we've seen the aftereffects of it's original release (such as rip-offs, sequels, etc.).

With all of that said, I just have a hard time finding anything at all WRONG with The Toxic Avenger. I just didn't find it entertaining like I thought I would. It's a definitive watch for any horror buff, or any movie buff in general. Maybe you'll find something entertaining that I didn't.",KKN_Doc8_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
68,KKN_Doc9_ToxicAvenger,"Four crazed teenagers speed down the road in their car, wildly bragging about points they've notched up by running down different people in the car. So many points for someone on a bike, so many points for an elderly person, and big points for a small child. ""How many points for a child on a bike?"" asks the driver, excited. Learning this will earn him maximum points, he proceeds to knock the small child off his bike, and he goes flying over the hood. They turn round and see the child move in pain. Horrified that he may lose out on his points, the driver then proceeds to reverse over the child's head, squashing it completely. Two girls get out of the car and take some pictures. This scene, for me, represents the majority of this film. More shocking than it should be, even today, but never taking itself at all too seriously, regardless of the horror on show.

Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a skinny, nerdy loser who works in the swimming baths, forever cleaning up with his mop. He is frequently bullied and humiliated by a high school gang who one day play a trick on him, which sees him kissing a goat dressed in a tutu. Horrified, Melvin flees and throws himself through a window, landing on a conveniently positioned (and open-topped) barrel of toxic waste. He begins to burn and rot, and eventually the toxic waste causes him to mutate in a taller, stronger, and ultimately more heroic beast, who wants revenge on his tormentors. Toxie (as he is now called, played by man-mountain Mitch Cohen) starts to clean up the city of Tromaville, which is being run by corrupt mayor Peter Belgoody (Pay Ryan), while at the same time romancing blind girl Sara (Andree Maranda) who he rescues from a rapist in a restaurant.

This was Troma's first big hit, and also their first foray into horror, having previously focusing on really crap sex comedies. After this, which after an initial unsuccessful run became a popular cult favourite on the B-movie circuit, they focuses only on horrors. This is the second Troma film I've seen. The other was Killer Nerd. You can probably assume from the title that it is a god-awful excuse for a film, although it is quite amusing in it's filmed-on-video awfulness (starring Harvey Pekar associate Toby Radloff). This, I'm pleased to say, was actually good! It was a hell of a lot more violent than I was expecting, and the special effects are actually pretty impressive in some places. And Toxie proves to be a likable vigilante/superhero, however hideous he may be.

Having said that, this is a low-budget Troma, and it's not exactly Citizen Kane. The acting is wooden, and the film is so 80's you can practically reach out and feel the sweatbands and mullets. But it is funny, satisfyingly gory, and, most importantly, fun. Toxie proves to be a more interesting 'superhero' than the majority of others. And the film actually has a social message in there somewhere, beneath all the tits and human-taco-making, recognising the pollution that we are all too aware of in our age of global warming and climate change. Now to sit through the three sequels, which I am quietly confident will be awful!",KKN_Doc9_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
69,KKN_Doc10_ToxicAvenger,"In the world of movies, many know of the main genres that cover all kinds of stories. But like anything else, there's always sublevels to these groups which can be broken down even further into their own genres. These genres are not the ones people either readily know about, have access to or is spoken of. An example of this are films produced from ""The Asylum"". Their reputation has become known for either making cheap knock offs or making cheap sequels to popular mainstream blockbusters. There are people who actively invest their time into those films. The same could be said for films made by Lloyd Kaufman under the Troma Entertainment banner. In a way, it's just another acquired taste like the previous company mentioned earlier. And although Kaufman was directing films a decade or so before this movie, it was this that got people's attention.

The story written by Kaufman and Joe Ritter in his first credit is about the fictional town of tromaville located on the outskirts of New York. The town is filled with polar opposite citizens; those who have common sense and others who literally do the most absurd things no reasonably sane person would ever do. Among them all is Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl), a loser pool boy at the local health club. He's by no means socially equipped to navigate through such an environment and is easily bullied. One day after a group psychotic adults play a practical joke exposing him to toxic waste, he transforms into The Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) and voiced by Kenneth Kessler. Now having superhero strength, Melvin takes it upon himself to rid the evil in his town of Tromaville. The film was also directed by Kaufman and Michael Herz, who collaborated with Kaufman on a few previous projects.

What works in the movie's favor is the tone audiences will experience from the execution. It's a simple plot about a discarded protagonist whose misfortune seen to others, turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to him. While out on his crusade Melvin crosses paths with a blind girl named Sara (Andree Maranda) and soon develops a connection. Its cliché but seeing the protagonist earn the respect from someone is something anyone would want. Does that mean the acting and characters well rounded? Absolutely not. Except for Melvin and Sara, no other character has redeeming qualities or resembles that of any regular human being. The way the actors play them and the way they're written are bizarre caricatures of what someone having no idea how a real person would behave.

It's very strange to watch but that's partially the appeal because it is so out there. Of the adults that badger Melvin, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist) are the women of the group who have the most reprehensible interests. Topping it off though are their partners beating up grannies in the street who are rightfully named Slug (Robert Prichard) and Bozo (Gary Schneider). How more obvious can a movie be with how serious they want their audience to take these characters? It's ridiculous and stupid to watch. Surprisingly, many of the actors in this feature didn't move on from it. The only two to kind come away with a career was Patrick Kilpatrick and Pat Ryan. The rest kind of dropped off shortly after. Adding to that are the violence and special effects.

This is mostly the reason why Troma Entertainment got more attention. Many of the films before were strictly adult. But somehow this found a wider release. There's plenty of blood and gore for those who love it despite not being a horror film. The camerawork by James A. Lebovitz was acceptable. Some of the not so hidden things within the filming process were not even noticeable and the action sequences are decently put together too. Lloyd Kaufman also assisted in this work. Finally, the music behind this movie was mediocre at best. There was no soundtrack unfortunately to get the full experience. There is a recurring theme for the Toxic Avenger...and it sounds familiar, but can't pinpoint it. There's other original songs sprinkled throughout the movie making it clear this is from the 1980s, but nothing that'll be a real ear catcher or sung by any popular artists.

This is by no means a great film. The characters and the acting behind it is so outlandish it's beyond realistic. Music wasn't that memorable either. Yet with that said, the way the simple story is executed along with good effects and camerawork make this worth a watch even if it wastes time.",KKN_Doc10_ToxicAvenger,KerryKurcz,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
110,RSV_Doc1_MinorityReport,"Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick’s science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg’s complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick’s 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author’s vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg’s most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick’s obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author’s ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick’s work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity’s evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg’s film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick’s vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker.Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C.’s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the “gifts” of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs’ foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn’t been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton’s personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorcé, he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer’s insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder. Anderton has no plans to kill anyone, nor does he recognize the foretold victim, someone named Leo Crow. But knowing the efficient and absolute manner in which Precrime officers detain their would-be perps, Anderton has no choice but to run and attempt to prove his innocence on the lam.Established within these first scenes are all the elements of a wrong-man thriller, drawn from the institution of Alfred Hitchcock’s cinema. Titles like The 39 Steps and Saboteur begin with the false charge of murder, the yarn unraveling as the protagonist does the impossible to prove their innocence. These are spellbinding stories that contain an immediate suspense given the nature of the plot. Spielberg takes every advantage of that, employing Hitchcockian tropes in the film’s high-tech setting. While following Anderton’s flight from justice, the director uses the chase to explore the film’s ultramodern environment, showcasing a range of technology and equipment, but never slowing his pace to artificially linger on the background details more than the immediate wrong-man scenario. Hitchcock did the same, making his environments entirely functional within their scenes, though distinctive in their selection. North by Northwest, for example, uses Mount Rushmore, an emblematic and immediately identifiable landmark for its rousing finale, the characters dodging bullets and hanging on for dear life by the edges of the monument’s massive sculpted faces. And yet, the heads of those former presidents are never more interesting than Cary Grant. Minority Report‘s screenplay, written by Scott Frank and Jon Coen, scatters an array of multihued characters into the futuristic milieu, the most diverse of them appropriately being John Anderton. Peter Stomare plays a vengeful doctor with a nasty cold; Tim Blake Nelson is the Precrime prison’s wheelchair-bound containment sentry; Daniel London as the clingy babysitter of the Precogs in their floating nutrient pool; Lois Smith is the pessimistic, sharp-witted mother of Precrime. Cruise, however, renders the performance of his career as Anderton. His intensity and dimensionality make the story not merely one of watching as special-effects instill marvel, but one fully grounded in the motivation of the character, the importance of the chase, the pain of his tragic background, and his pursuit of answers to a crucial mystery.When Anderton decides to flee, a series of events perfectly ingrained into the future world of the film build to a matchless chase sequence, compiling twenty or so of the most exhilarating minutes in all of cinema. Inside his magnetically propelled car which rides on automated tracks, Anderton speaks to Burgess in a frenzied attempt to determine why he would murder this man named Leo Crow. As Precrime takes control of Anderton’s vehicle remotely, he carhops on a vertical highway and eventually makes his way to the subway. Eye scanners that track oncoming passengers via retinal charting help Precrime officers meet Anderton on the platform at the next stop; on jetpacks they pursue him into an alleyway where, when cornered, Anderton attacks, zapping his former colleagues with their own “sick sticks.” After commandeering a jetpack for himself, he flies through an apartment complex, escaping into an industrial district. The chase ends in an automated car factory, amid mechanical parts flashing sparks and robot assembly lines busying themselves. The officers on Anderton’s tail wield energy force “concussion guns,” blasting boxes and each other without harming surfaces. Witwer arrives on scene and he and Anderton engage in fisticuffs. Our hero drops from a moving platform onto the assembly line, into the framework of an unfinished vehicle. Automaton arms install pieces of the vehicle around him, Anderton barely evading part after part during the car’s assembly. His pursuers watch from a distance as the vehicle comes together, their perpetrator nowhere to be seen, possibly crushed inside the car being built around him. The car moves off the factory line, its construction finished; then Anderton sits up in the driver’s seat, unharmed. In one motion from the assembly line to speeding away to freedom, Anderton’s escape is complete.Spielberg envisaged the car factory sequence from a concept originally envisioned by Hitchcock for North by Northwest. The Master of Suspense wanted Cary Grant’s character, Roger O. Thornhill, to find himself in a Detroit automobile factory. As Thornhill walked and talked with an informant, the audience would have witnessed a car in the background being built on the factory line through a single tracking shot. Alas, Hitchcock and his writer Ernest Lehman could not conceive a reason to place Thornhill in Detroit, so the proposal was scrapped. Spielberg adapted it for Minority Report, using a piece of unproduced film history to directly acknowledge his picture as an ode to Hitchcockian devices. Another Minority Report scene features Anderton escaping into the rain with an umbrella, a Precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), guiding him to freedom by forecasting every move he should make to elude his pursuers. As Precrime officers pursue him on a higher level, they look down to see a crowd of pedestrians all with umbrellas and Anderton, umbrella overhead, lost in the throng, the scene a direct parallel of one in Hitchcock’s Foreign Correspondent. But more than a particular scene or two, Minority Report borrows the raw cinematic essence of Hitchcock thrillers—the atmosphere of tension combined with a pitch of pure, joyful entertainment. The momentum, from the nonstop crescendo of thrills throughout to the very public and quickly resolved finale, mirrors that of films like North by Northwest and Saboteur, and a dozen other Hitchcock pictures. The tone is serious while also allowing for humor, and the suspense never loses its potency. Spielberg uses Hitchcockian bird’s eye camera angles, long zooms, and sets his story to a rousing score by John Williams worthy of Bernard Herrmann, without losing his own directorial flourishes. And he accomplishes all this without feeling derivative; indeed, moviegoers not intimately familiar with Hitchcock’s oeuvre will miss the reverence hidden in plain sight onscreen.What Spielberg does differently than Hitchcock is turn his central plot device, or MacGuffin, into a critical philosophical tool for the entire film, versus the frivolous and pointless item Hitchcock’s MacGuffin usually proves to be. Hitchcock used microfilm or diamonds or cold hard cash, whereas the MacGuffin in Minority Report proves to be the eponymous file saved in the Precog’s brain. The three Precogs (Agatha, Dashiell, and Arthur, named after three writers you may have heard of) work as a hive mind, but the most gifted of them, Agatha, occasionally sees something different than the other two. Agatha’s “minority report” suggests that the Precogs’ vision will not necessarily occur the way they have communally predicted. For the integrity of Precrime, Burgess ordered that these reports be destroyed, though a copy remains stored away in Agatha’s unconscious. When Anderton learns of this, he sets out to find his minority report, if one exists, and expose his probable innocence. But before ever approaching the futuristic megalopolis wherein Precrime and ultimately his innocence reside, he prepares himself. Knowing that no matter how stealthy he may be, retinal scanners will identify him before ever reaching the city, Anderton arranges for an eye transplant in the criminal underground. He enters The Sprawl, a dodgy part of town both dark and enclosed, where Spielberg mutates his thriller with a film noir interlude. Projected on the room’s dank wall is a scene from Samuel Fuller’s gritty noir classic The House of Bamboo (a scene which Spielberg later uses to mirror Witwer’s death), an homage that also nods to the noirish manner of these scenes. A mad doctor performs Anderton’s procedure, leaving his eyes bandaged for a mandatory 12-hour recovery, his only comfort being some rotten chow in the fridge should he get hungry. Shadows fill the room, ceiling fans keep the space active, and neurological drugs pass the time. In the scenes prior to and after this sequence, the film contains a blue-gray sheen. Frequent Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski over-lights the bright future, bleach-bypassing them in post-production to retain a metallic utopian polish. But in The Sprawl there is only darkness interrupted by high contrast lighting.Driven into hiding by state-of-the-art policing technologies, Anderton must leave The Sprawl when technology seeks him out. A patrol moves from building to building in search of their fugitive, dropping “spiders” to scout out and scan residents. These self-guided, metallic gizmos scurry into homes for mandatory retinal identification; however, Anderton’s eyes need more time to heal from his surgery. Opening them now could leave him blind, and so he submerges himself in ice water to block the spiders’ infra-red sight. The spiders move from room to room, as Spielberg shows us in a skillful overhead sequence, filmed using an amazing set piece with precise camera movements that capture the residents through broken light panels and shabby ceiling tiles. The robotic hunters locate Anderton, hearing the smallest sound, but they scan only the counterfeit identity he paid for. What absorbing ideas these are for a world of plausible ingenuity. Part of Minority Report’s appeal is reveling in the superior technologies; headhunting spiderbots and magnetic cars and retinal scanners take a foreground role, but production designer Alex McDowell (Fight Club) imparts every scene with something imaginative and new. While many of the wonders therein originated in Philip K. Dick’s body of work, the better part of the film’s futuristic gear was conceived by some of today’s top minds. In 1999, two years prior to filming, Spielberg arranged a conference between fifteen specialists from various scholarly branches to assist in devising a believable, relevant futureworld. Representatives from the fields of architecture, biomedical research, physics, transportation, and modern fiction gave their input and helped boost the environment of the film, lending the configuration behind the film’s distinctive look, while also conceiving those clever details that make the world a believable tomorrow.Spielberg renders the film’s technology through a seamless blend of computer-generated images and physical creations, being a filmmaker who knows how to craft the fantastical into reality. Be it dinosaurs, wondrous UFOs, or lost biblical artifacts, the director’s ability to make the impossible seem real is unmatched. As a result, Spielberg’s mise-en-scène feels credible, more so than comparable science-fiction settings. The futurist aspects of the film were designed to be integrated with contemporary architecture, as if the environment had been built upon again and again through generations of advancement. The practicality of this filmic world and its believable consumer products have such a tangible sense of possibility that modern scientists have begun building what movie special-effects wizards created for the film. 3-D holograms, with which Anderton views home videos of his wife and son, appeared on CNN during the 2008 presidential election. NEC Corporation unveiled a camera in Japan that detects age and sex, formatting nearby advertisements to fit the photographed audience, similar to the retinal scanners in the film. And a number of companies have used Minority Report as inspiration to make touch-screens (like the iPad) and gestural interfaces (Xbox’s Kinect) a reality, drawing from the scenes where Anderton disassembles the seemingly random images from the Precog vision by tossing them about a clear, free-floating computer console. And when Minority Report isn’t shaping our real-life world, its influence is felt on countless other films, including virtually every subsequent sci-fi effort—Michael Bay’s The Island, Marvel’s Iron Man, J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek, and the list goes on.The film’s technology is never included superfluously. Each piece makes a comment on the scene or the vast future envisioned within the film, fully embedding them into the moment organically, always in service of the story’s unrelenting momentum. Consider the intrusive advertising, compelled by retinal scanners that read Anderton’s identity and try to sell him everything from beer to cars, or chart when he gets on the subway. Reading the retina, they flash across the eye to capture an identity, logging the information, location, and patterns into a stored database. Shown as a security measure early in the film, the scanner turns into a dangerous trap when Anderton is a fugitive, as the police connect to the scanning database to help find their man. Although the presence of in-film advertisements undoubtedly served needed product placements (most prominently Lexus, Pepsi, and Gap) and therein financing for the $102 million dollar production, the film itself integrates the technology of advertising scans into the thriller scenario, and the presence of the scanners and ads shifts dramatically, transforming into an invasion of privacy and an obstacle Anderton must overcome. Empathizing with the wrong-man hero, the viewer now sees the scanner less as a device to follow shopping habits and more of a tool to retain order. And because of this, Anderton goes to the extreme of transplanting his eyes with that of a non-criminal to escape the scanners’ constant presence. In another of Minority Report influences on modern culture, the seemingly futurist 2002 film predicted the outgrowth of invasive ads in metropolitan centers such as Times Square or downtown Tokyo.Set aside the suspense of this extended sequence of events, if possible, and instead reflect on what each technological detail tells the audience about the world of Minority Report. The magnetic car suggests this future offers an environmentally friendly solution to transportation, but that the driver has no control over their vehicle should an emergency arise. The eye scanners alert police to dangerous persons on the subway, making one of the most typically dangerous forms of public transportation worry free. Indeed, these conveniences make life easier, but they also grant a near absolute authority to the nonlethal police. The jetpack, Spielberg’s nod to the escapist sci-fi serials of yesteryear, remains the most implausible piece of technology in the film; though Spielberg acknowledges as much when Anderton spins his teammate opponents out of control. The technology reveals the utopia of Minority Report to be a dystopia in disguise. In Blade Runner, another Philip K. Dick adaptation, director Ridley Scott made the decomposition of his future landscape apparent in every frame, the putrefaction of the setting undeniable. Spielberg, conversely, aligns the conditions with the story. In the opening scenes, the District of Columbia gleans from its perfection, its rightness and spectacle soon to be expanded across the country when Precime is approved for national expansion. When Anderton wields technology in his favor, Spielberg treats it as an extraordinary spectacle. But when the hunter becomes the hunted, every tool at his disposal twists into a dangerous villain, frightening and impossible to counteract. Only through Anderton’s desperate humanity can he fight it. A futurology such as Dick’s admires how beneficial technology can be but also weighs the inevitable dehumanizing downfalls.In the case of Precrime, the question of technology develops into one of Free Will versus Determinism within an entrenched timeline, and using said technology to breach that timeline. Beginning with the Precogs’ prediction that Anderton will commit murder, the indictment sets into motion a chain of events that inevitably leads Anderton to kill his predicted target. So the question remains, would Anderton have killed Leo Crow if the accusation was not made? This is the film’s philosophical paradox through which the McGuffin is rendered all-important; and while raised, the question can garner no correct response outside of creative guesswork. The critique of the would-be utopia is complete when Anderton rescues Agatha to find his minority report; he learns she is not a foreseeing wunderkind, but an accident resulting from her neurological drug-addicted mother, and a prisoner in her position. Atrophied and woozy from the sedatives the technicians keep her on to predict more fluently, Agatha is nearly broken, jaded by the present, and clumsily clinging to her rescuer. She informs Anderton that though he has no minority report, he has a choice; by knowing his future, he can thusly change it by force of will. The structure of Determinism is subject to the unpredictability of Free Will. Regardless of his lacking minority report, Anderton has the self-control not to kill Crow. This choice repeats itself in the finale when Anderton confronts Burgess, the architect of the film’s frame job. The Precogs predict Burgess will kill Anderton, but Burgess chooses differently. The utopian aspects of the future, as well as The Precogs that are all but deified by their followers for the violence they have prevented, are both proven façades within a defective future bent on maintaining an illusion of perfection. In true form for Philip K. Dick, but strangely pessimistic for director Steven Spielberg, the film portrays the crumbling of a utopia through its reliance on its advances. Even if the story ends well for Anderton and the freed Precognitives, the future is nonetheless a bleak one.Beyond the genius sewn into the fabric of its scenario, its thread reinforced by the intricacy of its setting, Spielberg composed Minority Report to be a fast-paced union of brains and virtuoso sequences. This is pure, deftly stylized cinema hurtling from one crisis to another with incredible speed and breadth and cunning. John Williams’ thrilling and playful score forms a pitch-perfect marriage with the breakneck proceedings, and the noirish storyline, wrapped inside its science-fiction framework, gives way to an uncommonly exciting motion picture of substantial characters and profoundly involving sci-fi applications. The visionary quality of Minority Report‘s cinematic world is matched solely by its endless influence on both film and real-world technology since its release. But most importantly, its influence never overwhelms the picture itself. Spielberg’s film is ingenious not only for the filmmaker’s countless moments of cinematic resourcefulness and aesthetic wonderment, but for how every fascinating bit of technology or invention suffused into the film has a direct implication on the forward-moving plot and its intensely feeling characters, and furthermore, how the plot expounds an underlying philosophical question. Deepening the kinetics of an adventure, Minority Report maintains the power of a dynamic, ceaselessly entertaining, cerebral series of ideas born in the limitless mind of Philip K. Dick. Indeed, few films have ever been so much all at once and done so with such sublime artistry.",RSV_Doc1_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
111,RSV_Doc2_MinorityReport,"In the movie it’s the future (2054) and we now see Washington D.C. where a system known as pre-crime is born. Pre-Crime is a new law system where people known as pre-cognitive are used as machines which can foretell the future and predict a major crime. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, one of the best officers who bust the people who commit the pre-crimes. The system is perfect, flawless and it does the job… but what happens when the system turns on you? Now, accused of killing a man in thirty-six hours he doesn’t know, he is now on the run from his own task force and a Government official (Colin Farrell) who wants him at all costs.I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg’s works. So, it was no surprise I’d try and check this out as soon as possible. I became a little jaded by his latest work “A.I.” which was sub-par, gloomy, and very confusing. I had my doubts going into this, but as I suspected I was in for a good time. This has to be one of Spielberg’s best ever; we instantly begin to become dazzled as Spielberg leaves us in awe with an incredible world which seems to be a mix of futuristic landscapes and skyscrapers mixed with small town suburbia and old-fashioned houses. We also get an amazing view of the highways of the future as cars not only drive along the ground but up on the sides of building into the skies.The city is very overcome by computer -generated ads by fashion companies and commercials that know our names and offer us products non-stop. We’re also kept under monitor as our eyes are scanned and indexed before we enter anyplace from bathrooms to trains. We get this view of the new world which is beautiful yet still very dangerous. The cast is phenomenal as Tom Cruise is at his top as John Anderton. We believe he is in danger and never doubt his desperation. I always question Tom Cruise as an actor, but this movie has proven me wrong.We get excellent stunts performed by Cruise himself as he scrambles desperately throughout the movie attempting to cheat a system that is basically fail safe. Colin Farrell is also truly excellent as Danny Witwer, the suspicious government operative who questions the system’s accuracy and will stop at nothing to catch John. The two plays off each other very well in action scenes and truly have excellent chemistry as they throw dialogue back and forth to one another, challenging each other’s expertise. Max Von Sydow is a great compliment to this movie as Tom’s Mentor and often his confidant helping him to fight off the law.The movie makes itself out to be a man-on-the-run movie when truly it is an intricate Hitchcockian murder mystery with plot twists and turns at every corner that kept me on the edge of my seat. This movie is very reminiscent of the golden era of movies where a thriller truly relied on character emphasis and plot twists rather than cheap contrived plot devices. Spielberg pulls out all the stops and is at his prime in this as he gives us truly dramatic camera angles that only increase the movie’s element of suspense and atmosphere. Spielberg lets us know that he can do any type of movie as he mends this movie into a masterpiece of art and acting. Ah, I remain loyal to Mr. Spielberg and continue to follow his movies and bow to his skill as he honors the movies with this masterpiece.",RSV_Doc2_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
112,RSV_Doc3_MinorityReport,"In the year 2054, at the Department of Precrime in Washington, D.C., Case 1108 is assigned to Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise). It’s a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in “red ball” situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion – since there’s no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event.This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy – and it’s on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog – the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha’s files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy – one in which Anderton himself is the murderer.In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It’s a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it’s just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated “Blade Runner” setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens – an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city.As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man’s piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It’s a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger’s sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg’s brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of “Minority Report,” which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism. And indeed, while the story is superbly complex, twisting and turning with expert elusiveness (save for a generic verbal slip to give away the final culprit), the original ending is altered to avoid the bleak, hopeless tragedy most often found in Dick’s potent short stories.",RSV_Doc3_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
113,RSV_Doc4_MinorityReport,"“Minority Report” is the most un-Spielberg film ever made by Steven Spielberg.There is plenty of heartbreak and sadness in Spielberg’s movies. Certainly fractured families are a central theme. He’s made movies about the Holocaust, D-Day and World War I trenches. The film he made right before this one was “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” in which bereaved parents replace their dying son with a robot who’s been tricked into thinking he’s a real boy.And yet, there is an undercurrent of light and hopefulness in his oeuvre that I find (mostly) missing in “Minority Report,” though “A.I.” probably comes closest in its dystopian themes and dour mood.In both movies technology has led to seemingly amazing achievements to benefit society, but there’s an insidious bargain underneath that threatens to upend the balance. That’s not surprising since it was based on a short story by the immortal Philip K. Dick, whose fears about the future essentially created its own film genre, tech noir. It was adapted for the screen by John Cohen and Scott Frank.I remember liking the film when it came out but not being amazed as other critics were. One of the areas I still find it lacking is the sense of an entire world being built around star Tom Cruise. Instead, it seems like Spielberg and his team created just enough pieces to serve as a backdrop, and no more. He doesn’t paint in the corners.There are the automated cars that move both horizontally and vertically, but other than a chase scene where Cruise leaps from vehicle to vehicle, they’re not really explored as a (literally) transportive societal evolution. Things seem… pretty well the same as they are now. They even have The Gap, in a self-reflexive bit of product placement.Though maybe the sameness is a commentary in and of itself.Set in the year 2054, the film has been pointed to as being prescient in its depiction of coming technological upheaval. We obviously don’t have the ability to predict the future or record thoughts into a video stream, though VR headsets can do a pretty good job of putting you into a created reality. And the mind-altering drug people use in the film, neuroin, bears disturbing similarities to the opioid epidemic of today.All the newspapers and magazines automatically update with the latest headlines, which if you were in the news business in the early Aughts, the talk of “e-paper” being the format of the future was all the rage. Instead we turned to reading on hard, graceless, 4-inch screens.Most interesting is the ever-present eye scanners, taking a cool gadget that’s a staple of the spy and sci-fi genres and turning it into an intimating facet of a world where our movements are continuously tracked — ostensibly for consumerist purposes, but as we quickly see the government is piggybacking on the gaze.We don’t use “eye-D,” as it’s called in the movie, so ubiquitously or without consent.

Or getting a report every month from Google Maps telling you exactly where you’ve been, and when.Most of us would be mortified to have our browser history made public. In the world of “Minority Report,” everything about us is on continual surveillance and display, up to and including the things we think about doing. Literally, people are arrested and punished for things they were about to do.The story is at its root a meditation on free will and predestination. Usually such tales are set against a theological backdrop — if God determines our path, how are we really free to choose?As a good Catholic boy growing up, I was instructed that thinking about committing an act is just a much a sin as actually doing it. This was taught as a way to forbid sinful thoughts, but as any pubescent soon realized, they’re as impossible to shut out as the old saw of “Don’t think about elephants.”I think it was George Carlin who observed that the majority of Catholics who lapsed figured out that if you were going to be punished equally for thinking about doing something, you might as well experience the fun of actually doing it.(“I’ll take glaring holes in catechism for $1,000, Alex.”)The film largely eschews religious issues, other than the decoration of some people considering the three “precogs” as deities unto themselves. They are children born of early neuroin users with psychic gifts, which used in conjunction can read people’s evil intents before even they themselves are aware of them.Of course, this also involves being imprisoned in a floating “milk bath” that heightens their powers, kept eternally pumped full of hallucinogens and fawned over by a quite possibly lecherous keeper, Wally (Daniel London).Agatha (Samantha Morton) is the “most gifted” of the three, twins Dashiell and Arthur basically serving as assist men to the true genius. The three are named after famous mystery writers, and were trained by Dr. Hineman (Lois Smith), now living out her days in lonesome regret.As is often the case in real life, the creative partner was outlasted and outmaneuvered by the business shark, in this case Max von Sydow as Lamar Burgess, who is now desperate to take the “PreCrime” experiment from Washington D.C. to a national stage. This means jumping through small hoops held by big people.Hence the arrival of the inquisitive mind of Danny Witwer, a wolf-like young assistant attorney general played by Colin Farrell in his breakout role in American films. He instantly focuses his attention on Chief John Anderton (Cruise), who is the heroic public face of PreCrime. John lost his own son in a bizarre abduction at a public swimming pool years earlier, tanking his marriage to Lara (Kathryn Morris) and turning him into a stealth neuroin user.In early scene, John goes jogging through the shady part of D.C., his real purpose to obtain a fix, which he uses to heighten his mood while watching (crude) holographic home movies of his lost kid. The blind dealer removes his glasses to reveal cavernous empty eye sockets, seemingly revealing his very brains, with the admonishment, “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king!”Watching the movie again, this line heralds a lot of high-contrast photography by cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, including a plethora of shots where one of a character’s eyes are turned away or lost in shadow.For me, the faster the movie’s plot-stirring gets, the more I tend to lose interest as it gets into pure chase-chase mode. Neal McDonough plays Fletch, John’s former right-hand man now charged with leading the hunt for him. “Everybody runs” is their mantra, leading to some slick action scenes with flying power suits and “sick sticks,” glowing batons that instantly make their target retch.In one of the movie’s coolest but most inscrutable sequences, John goes to have his eyes swapped out in a black market procedure to fool the eye-D scans.Peter Stormare plays the bottom-bucket doctor, who blows snot all over his hand right before sucking out John’s eyeballs. In a riveting soliloquy, the not-good doctor reminds John — now addled by anesthesia — that the chief locked him away years ago for intentionally setting his patients on fire, and now back-alley eye jobs are the only medical work he can do.It revs up to a classic “I shall have my revenge” declaration:“For true enlightenment there is nothing like… well, let’s just say taking a shower while this large fellow with an attitude you couldn’t knock down with a hammer, that keeps whispering in your ear: ‘Oh Nancy, Oh Nancy.’ Now that was a lot of fun, thank you so very much John for putting me in there, thank you so very much for giving me an opportunity to get to know myself much better.”As near as I can figure, though, the doc never actually extracts any kind of revenge. He competently performs his job, at less than his usual rate, even. John has a nasty encounter with a putrid sandwich and spoiled milk placed in the fridge of his recovery flophouse, though they appear to be genuine accidents as he blindly reaches on the wrong shelf from where the fresh sustenance lies.As much as I enjoy Stormare’s effortless creepy presence and off-kilter line readings, this whole bit feels like a buildup to an important moment that never arrives. I believe the whole thing could be chopped down to quick montage and improve the pacing. Though this would maybe suck some of the life out of the subsequent house search by tiny “spiders,” disc-like robots with wire-thin appendages deployed by the PreCrime brutes to infiltrate and forcibly eye-D peopleHence Cruise’s green eyes become dark brown halfway through the movie. He keeps the old eyes in a plastic biggie to sneak back into the PreCrime HQ (no one thinking to lock out his profile, apparently) with the intent to have them put back one day, but comically loses one down a drain.Tim Blake Nelson turns up as Gideon, the wheelchair-deployed officiate of the PreCrime “prison” where reside people judged and sentenced without actually committing any dastardly acts. They lie forever dreaming in plastic tubes, wearing coma-inducing “halos” around their heads like fallen angels as Gideon plays them orgiastic organ music to calm their prematurely damned souls.As Nelson brings an innate disquieting anxiety to his roles, one instantly wonders if, like Wally, Gideon is supplanting his official duties with an occasional tug ‘n’ grope of his comelier charges.John himself is briefly sentenced to the halo prison, his long run finally ending due to the machinations of Burgess, who is using his protege as the sacrificial pawn to ensure PreCrime is cleared for a national rollout. Lara springs him… surprisingly easily, and many have wondered if the film’s entire last act is a big guffaw and everything we’ve seen is merely the imaginings of John, still trapped in his plastic prison on a never-ending high.This would, of course, be a mirror of the finale of Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil,” one of my all-time favorite films and a clear inheritor of Philip K. Dick’s prescient, precious paranoia. His cinematic children were legion, even without an official credit.And while I don’t think “Minority Report” is among the finest of the adaptations, it’s a film that has aged rather well in nearly a couple of clicks down the big highway. There was even a briefly lived TV series a few years ago that came and went without me (or anyone) much noticing.Things end on a (somewhat artificial) high note — Burgess slain by his own hand, PreCrime disbanded and the not-yet criminals released, Agatha and the twins relocated from their enforced isolation in the pool to a self-imposed one in a lonely cottage on a Scottish cliff or wherever, free to live in the now and not the future.John even caresses the swelling belly of Lara, their love reborn with another life and shot at parenthood. It seems that free will does reign, along with happy endings in Spielberg flicks — even if it takes two-plus hours of haunting parable to get there.",RSV_Doc4_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
114,RSV_Doc5_MinorityReport,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is a busy film. It fills your eye and ear - and, even rarer, your mind. It speculates on the future and uses what it visualises to commentate on the present.Like its three ""pre-cogs"" - clairvoyant visionaries gifted with the power to foresee future events - it forewarns us of the shape of things to come - some of which are already here. The film's sheer timeliness is a great part of its importance.It's set in Washington DC, a metropolis whose murder rate has dropped to zero. Crimes are prevented before they can be committed - thanks to tapping into the pre-cogs' premonitions. But if the streets are safe, it's because the old watchword about the price of liberty being eternal vigilance has been given a sinister techno-twist. In Spielberg's futureworld, the price of liberty is eternal surveillance.For all its own impressive dystopian design and cyborg melodrama, a comparable film like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was light on the way the future is already impacting on the here and now.Minority Report, based on a brilliant extrapolation from Philip K Dick's SF novel, pulls together what we see happening already in a world where people have their identities ""stolen"", machines ""judge"" our entitlement to be believed or not, and incarceration is sanctioned on suspicion of what we may do, not what we have done.In A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kubrick foresaw the day a Minister of the Interior would brainwash criminals into subservience to the state and justify it because ""it works"".Spielberg's movie is the new, improved version of the proto-police state. It begins with what, for this director, is an uncommon kind of overture: sex and violence.Tom Cruise, head of the Pre-Crime Unit, stands on a podium. Before him, like instruments in an orchestra, are screens whose subliminal images, sourced from the clairvoyant pre-cogs, illustrate a crime passionel about to be committed.Like a conductor, Cruise waves his cybergloved hands accelerando in a race against time to pick 'n' mix the visual clues to the scene of the crime-to-be. This sequence alone crosses a new frontier in high-tech cinema.The airborne SWAT team, descending vertically on individual jet-propelled backpacks, make their arrest just before the jealous husband puts the knife in. He's whipped off to eternal hibernation, standing upright, to save space in prison.This prologue demo sets the stripcartoon style and pace of a movie that uses brainpower, not bubbles, to carry its message. Cruise is a flawed hero. His own child was abducted years before.The ""home movies"" he watches in his lonely high-rise home - actually images of ex-wife and lost child who ""materialise"" in his living-room in 3D - have a poignant melancholy suggestive of the loss of other values once real and dear to its citizens.Cruise's loss of his son is what motivates him to fight crime. Not for the first time in a Spielberg film, the violated family echoes the director's own childhood trauma just as Cruise's uneasy relationship with his boss, a patriarchal eminence played by Max von Sydow, recalls the director's acknowledged breach with his own father. In Minority Report, I suspect, is buried a substantial private agenda.The Washington DC Pre-Crime Unit is due to go national. A man from the Justice Department (Colin Farrell) arrives. This exseminarian operates with Jesuitical thrust and parry. In a few seconds, Cruise's authority is under threat. Farrrell's character is motivated by pure power, and played by an actor who doesn't just enter the film; he invades it. His performance can look Cruise in the eye without flinching.The air of conspiracy thickens when Cruise suddenly dredges up a pre-cognitive projection of himself committing a murder. Since technology refuses to admit mistakes - a bittersweet endorsement of HAL 9000's presumptuousness in Kubrick's 2001 - Cruise goes on the run to track the glitch in the machine to source, and discover the ""minority report"" made by the pioneers of Pre-Crime, which may exonerate his predicted crime.Like most Philip K Dick plots, the dramatic peak of cinematic imagination flattens somewhat at this point, though never suppressing the vital functions of plot or Spielberg's vision of controlled "" freedom"" 50 years from now.Fleeing, Tom is bombarded by advertising posters that identify him by his retina and importune him by his name; his ""wanted"" photo in the daily newspaper moves and speaks; the obligatory car-chase turns extraordinary when the cars start running up the walls of skyscrapers on tracks like a trouser zip; and desperate remedies to avoid detection, like having his eyeballs replaced with someone else's, has its own jokey pay-off when an electronic sentinel at a branch of Gap greets him with, ""Good to see you again, Mr Fukuyama.""Amid the bleak, metallic tones of designer Alex McDowell's cityscape, Spielberg stages some virtuoso action.Cruise grapples with a cop whose jet-pack goes ballistic and whirls both of them into the air, up the walls, through the windows, into living-rooms and kitchens - where the hamburgers get a passing grilling from the jet's exhaust - and up through the roof. Cruise jousts with Farrell on a moving assembly line in a car factory, and gets built into the bodywork of a brand new auto.All through Minority Report, there are nods of homage to cine-masters such as Hitchcock, Kubrick and Bergman. The shaven-headed precog savant (Samantha Morton) whom Cruise abducts and takes with him, in his flight, resembles the all-wise Star Child who swims into our ken at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.More unexpectedly, the wise old woman (Lois Smith) who pioneered the Pre-Crime project and now tends interactive plants in her greenhouse - one of them takes a shine to Cruise - resembles a more sober version of the clairvoyant Madame Arcati in NoÎl Coward's Blithe Spirit. (Spielberg is a Coward fan.)Minority Report ends with a confrontation American-style, rather than with an open-end conundrum in the European movie-making mode. Spielberg maybe felt he'd bowed sufficiently to questioning man's destiny when he made AI: Artificial Intelligence as a dutiful act of homage to Kubrick.If less poetic than AI, Minority Report is much more confidently directed, with a firmer sense of its maker's own urge to entertain and stimulate rather than bemuse.But even with a happier than warranted ending, the film is not comfort food for liberals. What elevates it far above its origin and format is its timely arrival. It constructs a world where security has become the main threat to liberty and every person's privacy is open to inspection by the state. It's a thriller with a built-in alarm bell. See it for your entertainment; ignore it at your peril.",RSV_Doc5_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
115,RSV_Doc6_MinorityReport,"Minority Report , directed by Steven Spielberg, screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on a short story by Philip K. DickMinority Report is the latest film directed by Steven Spielberg. In the year 2054 murder has been eliminated in Washington DC through the use of a team of psychics who infallibly foresee killings. The would-be murderers are apprehended before they commit their crimes and sent to cryogenic freezing units. When the leading figure in the “Pre-Crime Unit,” John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is named as the future killer of a man he does not know, he sets out to unravel the mystery, with his own police force hot on his trail. Anderton’s own son was abducted and presumably murdered some years before, an event that also shattered his marriage.Spielberg is one of the more gifted members of a generation of studio filmmakers whose output in general has been exceedingly poor and forgettable. He has the undoubted ability to narrate a drama effectively, to hold the spectator’s attention and to develop a theme. His themes, however, tend to revolve around the concerns of his generation of upper middle class Americans. It is surely notable that in a filmmaking career spanning thirty tumultuous years, Spielberg, whose personal wealth reportedly exceeds $2 billion, has not once weighed in tellingly on the state of American society.Minority Report, based on a 1956 short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, has intriguing and entertaining elements. No expense has been spared. The filmmakers have thought up all manner of ingenious devices, combining the retrograde and the futuristic, to create the world of 2054. However, as is nearly always the case in contemporary science fiction, the imagination has only been set to work on “things,” not relations between people, not social life.There are absurdities in Minority Report which reveal a great deal about the social assumptions and prejudices of its creators. The American society of half a century from now is presented as generally prosperous and content, insofar as one is able to determine, but crime and murder (and drug use) persist. Why? Is there no connection between poverty and violent behavior, or, more generally, between social reality and crime? The filmmakers are either adapting to themselves to the right-wing argument that crime is essentially causeless (rooted in Man’s fallen state) or, probably more to the point, indicating their lack of interest in its causes and a concern merely with the means of avoiding its consequences.The discovery that the psychics do not always agree, that there are suppressed “minority reports,” suggesting other possible outcomes, is the turning point in Spielberg’s film. The Pre-Crime Unit may, in fact, be seizing and incarcerating those who were never going to commit any offenses. Anderton finds out for himself the complex relationship between the apparently inevitable and the actual manner in which events play themselves out.One can only respond: thank heavens for small mercies. Steven Spielberg and company do not, in the end, come down on the side of preemptively locking up everyone who is a potential criminal. A great day for democracy indeed!It was apparently a close call, however. When Spielberg was first considering the film project, he told Time, he “‘had much more of a popcorn movie in mind until I began to think about the ramifications of arresting people without due process.’ The director says it was his friend Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian, who alerted him to the constitutional problems of Precrime. ‘She said, “This would be a wonderful thing,” recalls Spielberg, “but what about the Bill of Rights?”’”Spielberg and Goodwin are not the only ones who find the idea appealing. Critic David Edelstein in Slate writes: “The movie presents us with a classic totalitarian trade-off, upgraded by technology and the paranormal: Would you surrender a slew of civil liberties for a world without crime? Assuming that the right people were always jailed for the right reasons, I’d think about it long and hard.”The assumption of all the above, of course, is that the state is a disinterested body, guided by fundamentally honorable motives, whose only concern is the welfare of its citizens. The notion that the state might represent distinct social interests, that it might be in the business of repressing the population for distinct political purposes—these are entirely foreign concepts to Spielberg and friends, who are, after all, a generally satisfied lot.This is not to say that the film offers no critique of the future world, or by implication, the present one. Spielberg is not a fool, nor simply a propagandist for the existing state of things. (After all, Schindler’s List had its moments.) The sight of helmeted, black-outfitted police crashing through windows and ceilings to apprehend individuals whose only crime is harboring violent thoughts is menacing and ominous—as are the images of mechanical spiders, who detect human presence, invading and searching an apartment building. However, Minority Report is largely carried along by other concerns and social impulses.Corporate saturation of American life, aided by technology, has reached such a point in 2054 that electronic billboards recognize the consumer (by his or her eyes) and deliver a personalized message. (“Good afternoon, Mr. Yakamoto. How did you like that three-pack of tank tops you bought last time you were in?”) On Internetnews.com Pamela Parker comments: “Imagine getting splashed by an animated digital billboard advertising Aquafina. Or having an ad in the subway say, ‘[Your name here], you look like you could use a Guinness,’ just as you’re coming home after a bad day at work. At one point in the movie the Tom Cruise character, on the run, is confronted by an American Express ad that says, ‘It looks like you need an escape, and Blue can take you there.’... Identification of consumers happens via retinal scans, which are presumably matched with names in a global database.”This invasive commercialism is more a source of amusement in the film, however, than disgust or protest. In any event, Spielberg is critiquing what his film encourages. Minority Report practices “product placement” (the display of commercial brands in a film) at a high level, providing advertising for Lexus, Reebok, Nokia, The Gap, Guinness, American Express, Bulgari and Pepsi-Cola’s Aquafina, among others.This “product placement” does not come free of charge. Lexus reportedly paid $5 million for the privilege of having a futuristic version of one of its automobiles appear in Minority Report. Business Week reports that “as part of the deal, the auto maker also delivered a shiny new $62,000 Lexus SC 430 convertible to Spielberg.” The magazine continues: “Why would Lexus put all that money into helping Spielberg design a pair of cars that will never be sold? Explains [Lexus marketing vice-president Mike] Wells: ‘We wanted to show the world that Lexus as a brand will be standing tall in 50 years.’”And there is more: “Lexus wasn’t the only large advertiser to help Spielberg defray the costs of making his film, which is laden with special effects. Phonemaker Nokia spent an estimated $2 million to design the futuristic handsets that Cruise and others use in the film, according to sources. Nokia also is running print and TV commercials to promote the film and its new 9290 Communicator, a $599 phone released in May, 2002, that can send and receive images, sound, and video clips. In addition, Nokia is promoting Minority Report on its Web site, where users can see the phone it designed for the film.”What is one to say? How could a film produced with such a degree of collaboration between filmmakers and giant transnational corporations possibly be expected to provide a clear-sighted view of contemporary life? At a time, no less, when the pervasive criminality of the corporate boardroom, its looting of the American economy of trillions of dollars, has been exposed.Hollywood’s liberalsThe views of Spielberg and his associates on crime, the police and democratic rights are conditioned by their social circumstances and connections. The garden variety Hollywood liberal, rich and complacent, would prefer, all things considered and if it did not prove too much of an inconvenience (or threaten his stock portfolio or career prospects), to live in a world where universal brotherhood reigned supreme. He does not view “democracy,” however, in association with the right of the broad mass of the population to decent living standards and to be defended against the coercive power of the capitalist state. In fact, he never thinks of such a thing at all, as contemporary films make clear. On the contrary, under conditions of growing social inequality, the population at large is seen in a generally hostile manner, as a potential threat to his wealth and privileges.All this directs today’s studio filmmaker irresistibly toward the figure of the policeman, both because he is the defender of private property (and thus deeply fascinating on the conscious and unconscious levels to the wealthy) and because he can be made to represent, falsely, “blue-collar” America.Minority Report provides us with a policeman’s-eye view, filtered through layers of Hollywood liberal cotton-wadding, of the issue of the police-state.In that sense, the filmmakers’ decision in the end to come down against “pre-crime,” while not unimportant, hardly stands out as a compelling defense of basic democratic rights. One only has to read the ignorant and wrongheaded comments of co-screenwriter Scott Frank: “People can be against capital punishment until they lose a loved one. We can be completely civilized until the murder rate goes way up and we need to figure out how to bring in the troops. That’s how dictatorships get started; it’s always for the greater good.”Minority Report’s general ambience reminds one of the discussions that took place in the liberal media following September 11 about the advisability of applying torture to terrorist suspects. The various commentators mulled over the idea of torturing prisoners, rolled it around on their tongues, so to speak, and generally concluded that, while tempting, it was probably not such a good idea. That such a discussion even takes place, whatever the immediate conclusions drawn, tells one everything about the given social milieu.Planning for Minority Report began three years ago and filming in March 2001. In its own peculiar fashion, this provides further proof that the Bush administration’s indefinite detention of individuals charged with no crime, the policy of making “preemptive arrests,” was not merely a response to the terrorist attack on New York and Washington, but was something very much “in the air.” It is a response, when viewed historically, to the increasingly untenable social contradictions of American society and the straining of these contradictions against the traditional forms of bourgeois democracy.Much has been made in the media about the coincidence of Minority Report’s opening and the incarceration of Jose Padilla, the alleged “dirty bomb” conspirator. The government claims the right to “anticipatory self-defense,” a phrase worthy of Spielberg’s “Pre-Crime Unit.” The film director told the New York Times in June: “Right now, people are willing to give away a lot of their freedoms in order to feel safe. They’re willing to give the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. far-reaching powers to, as George W. Bush often says, root out those individuals who are a danger to our way of living. I am on the president’s side in this instance. I am willing to give up some of my personal freedoms in order to stop 9/11 from ever happening again. But the question is, Where do you draw the line? How much freedom are you willing to give up? That is what this movie is about.”Minority Report has to be seen in the context of the subservience and spinelessness of Hollywood liberalism, and American liberalism in general. Those who wonder out loud about the pros and cons of a police-state have already accepted such a regime in principle. The passionate defense of democratic rights, as we have noted more than once on the WSWS, finds fewer and fewer partisans within the upper echelons of American society.",RSV_Doc6_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
116,RSV_Doc7_MinorityReport,"Once again this year we are graced with a futuristic sci-fi flick based on a short story by the visionary Philip Dick, this time in the form of “Minority Report”, which poses the intriguing hypothesis: What if we could see into the future and arrest people before they commit a murder, or any other crime for that matter? Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as “Pre-Cogs” who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are “set” to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this “perfect” system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let’s face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he’s innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie.Directed by Steven Spielberg, “Minority Report” reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg’s last futuristic foray, “A.I.”, a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski’s artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning – those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect.Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise’s energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha’s Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha – tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (“Dune”, “Judge Dredd” and “The Exorcist”) steps in as Anderton’s superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protégé Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who evokes a dichotomy of emotion in his belief and/or disbelief of the Pre-Crime system. As should be no surprise in a Spielberg film, supporting performances all seem to rise to new levels of excellence. Steve Harris, best known as Eugene Young on “The Practice”, is intriguing as Jad, but let’s not miss Neal McDonough as Officer Fletcher. McDonough is a man who has the ability to exude futuristic creepy at the drop of a hat. And of course, nepotism rears its – in this case – pretty head in the form of Spielberg’s daughter Jessica Capshaw who is excellent as Evanna.Unfortunately, I have the same problem with “Minority Report” as with “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.” Deviation from the original Dick story leaves huge gaps in the plot which require implausible explanations in order to close out the film. And again, we are left with numerous unanswered questions created by these implausible plot leaps. Although artistically and technically masterful, ambitious and intriguing, “Minority Report” still leaves you looking for the Spielberg of old – where cute and not-so-cute dinosaurs rule the world, even cuter aliens steal our hearts and we can all believe in a joyful place called Never Never Land with the help of a just a little pixie dust and a happy thought.",RSV_Doc7_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
117,RSV_Doc8_MinorityReport,"Set in the year 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report looks clammy and bleached-out. The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience déjà vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven?The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter.There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be quite so scary to Spielberg the corporate-honcho visionary, who simply presents this stuff as a fact of (future) life. His attitude is a wary bemusement.What really spooks him, as in A.I., is that it may no longer be possible to be truly human in such a cyberfuture. Anderton, in addition to his Precrime problems, is also aggrieved by the unsolved kidnapping six years ago of his son. He compulsively plays back holographic home movies of his boy and has a drug habit. All this is meant to humanize Anderton for us, but Tom Cruise doesn't really have much inner life as an actor, and so the effect is muddled. Anderton is supposed to be running away from himself, from his demons, but that's not what comes across. He's running to get away. Cruise has become such a movie-star icon that we're supposed to gasp in awe whenever he gets down and dirty and messes with his iconography. In what amounted to a ghastly piece of reverse narcissism in Vanilla Sky, he spent half the movie sporting a surgically distended face. (It's as if he were saying, ""Look how ugly I make myself and still you watch me."") In Minority Report, he's such a dynamo that he converts even the process of grieving into a form of aerobics. Cruise carries the movie, but I was relieved to turn to some of the other players, including Colin Farrell as Anderton's nemesis, and Samantha Morton as the most gifted of the Pre-cogs, for more evocative human shadings.Spielberg is still in his Kubrick mode in Minority Report, which is to say that, even more than in A.I., he has split himself off from the verve and emotional sympathy that characterize his best films. I respect his desire to challenge himself and go deeper and darker. It's just that most of what's dark about Minority Report is basically futuro film noir, and what's ""deep"" about it are the standard sci-fi tropes about the individual vs. society and what's real and what isn't, as well as the usual quasi-religious overtones about playing God. Ultimately, the film turns into a soporific anthem for the power to choose one's future, followed by a quick fadeout of family togetherness. Although he can't quite get himself to do it, Spielberg clearly wants to drop the sentimentality from his repertoire: That anthem strikes a hollow chord, and the family idealizations are one-note. Minority Report is, among other things, Spielberg's attempt to extirpate once and for all his inner E.T. Like Cruise, he desires to deface his own image, which is perhaps why this new movie specializes in shots of severed eyeballs -- it's practically a motif. The most visually dynamic director of his generation wants to know what it's like to fly blind. That's what most repels him -- and attracts him. He's virtuosic enough to keep Minority Report aloft, but he's not soaring.",RSV_Doc8_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
118,RSV_Doc9_MinorityReport,"In Minority Report, a futuristic thriller set in 2054, murder has been eliminated in Washington DC thanks to a division of law enforcement known as Precrime. Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers.Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities.Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future.As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!""Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication to fighting crime, the movie resorts to plot devices so often seen in cop dramas: after the disappearance of his young son six years ago, John has lost himself in drugs and his job, thus resulting in his wife leaving him. His home movies of his son are equally uninspired. Saturated with sappy, artificial sentiment, they should come with a warning label: ""Caution: May cause unnecessary and uncontrollable vomiting.""I'll give it credit for one thing: visually, Minority Report is remarkably stunning and imaginative. Its depiction of the future is vivid, highly realized, and full of creative technology. The elegant computer systems are particularly cool, and a concussion gun that Cruise unleashes on his pursuers looks like one hell of a fun toy. And with the cold, metallic colors that dominate the movie, the scenery often conveys a mood that the actors, plot, and dialogue cannot--a mood that is perfectly fitting for a dystopian story with characters who dream of murder 24/7.",RSV_Doc9_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
119,RSV_Doc10_MinorityReport,"What new hell is this? In the shallow, noisy and pretentious Minority Report , we have seen the future. It’s not pretty.There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler’s List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelgänger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them.Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it’s set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a “priori,” developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called “Pre-Cogs” who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he’s a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs.The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General’s office who covets Anderton’s job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who’ll-do-it as the flawed hero (he’s hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film’s playing time to two hours plus. Mr. Cruise, who barely survived Vanilla Sky , one of the worst movies ever made, bares his teeth and pecs in a variation of the same role he played in that fiasco-a man driven insane by a technological bad dream. Not much of a stretch there, and the techno-gibberish about “Pre-Cog echoes” and “prevision data bases,” spouted with a terminally pained expression from the ludicrous script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, almost flattens him.Meanwhile, Mr. Spielberg pours on the gore. In one scene, the star has his eyeballs surgically removed because in the future, we are told, identity searches scan only eyes. (Gee, whatever happened to fingerprints?) Carrying around those Tom Cruise eyes in a plastic bag as a sentimental keepsake, he drops one retina through the cracks of a drain while the other one hangs by its bloody optical nerves. Not a movie for anyone considering corrective Lasik procedures, or even changing contact lenses. Also not a movie where acting counts. Samantha Morton, with a shaved head, has an out-of-body experience as the Pre-Cog who disagrees with the others (this is called a “minority report”). Tim Blake Nelson plays the fiend who contains all of the killers, rapists and psychos from the past in data pods. The marvelous Lois Smith, who steals her brief scenes with relish as a horticulturist who holds the secrets to the minority reports, is nutty as a pecan pie. But the characters aren’t human enough to be real, or metaphorical enough to be comic caricatures. In the end, they are all upstaged by the macabre effects, created by production designer Alex McDowell, that make the whole movie look as though it was staged inside a stainless-steel paint bucket.When in doubt, bring on the gimmicks. Mr. Spielberg complies, showing off the latest stunts, tricks and toys as distractions far more interesting than the movie itself. Futuristic subway riders reading digital newspapers in which the headlines change between stops. Cops flying through space between skyscrapers like Superman in magnetic-levitation cars. Angry trees that grab you like the nasty apple orchard in The Wizard of Oz , injecting a poison that can only be cured by a foul-tasting brewed tea. Animatronic spiders slithering through walls and floorboards to identify suspects by shining a light in their eyes. Loopily cinematic, Mr. Spielberg the practical joker even stages a chase scene in a Gap store.Some things never change. Niche filmmaking will obviously still plague us in 2054, and so will the serious, unsettling questions it raises but fails to answer. Why is it that the visions of the Pre-Cogs never extend beyond Washington, D.C.? How will the Orwellian effect of the new technology invade privacy and affect civil rights? If the Pre-Cogs see different images, how can you prove a crime is going to happen beyond a reasonable doubt? In the ideological confusion, the film loses its credibility and raises more legal, social and political questions than it can handle. Mr. Cruise gets lost in the stew like a carrot. He looks like hell and goes through hell to earn his millions, but in Minority Report he’s just a small black hole at the center of an even bigger black hole.",RSV_Doc10_MinorityReport,RSV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
40,KCM_Doc1_AngelHasFallen,"Boredom sets in long before the start of Angel Has Fallen. I start my journey to the movie by changing out of my work clothes into something more comfortable. Instead of something complex like a dress shirt with buttons and a collar along with khaki pants that require a belt, I wear a loose-fitting t-shirt and a light pair of cargo shorts. I want something simple and uncomplicated, like the plot to an action movie boiled down to guy is framed, guy wants revenge, guy kills guys for revenge. It took only one person to pick out both of my outfits for the day, an accomplishment that seems remarkable compared to the three people who wrote the script to Angel Has Fallen, completely different from the two people who wrote the story of said movie. A total of five people were needed to tell another convoluted story of Gerard Butler running from slightly-bearded men with guns for two hours. Compared to the 15 minutes it took me to figure out the clothes appropriate for the day, its hard to figure out which effort was more difficult to do, or more fun. 5 p.m. and the theater Im going to is across the street from my local mall. Ive got a couple hours to kill so I swing by my local Newbury Comics to see if the new Friendly Fires record was on shelves. They didnt have a copy available and I was disappointed. I couldnt see my specific reaction to said news but I think it would look similar to that of Morgan Freeman throughout Angel Has Fallen. Once again playing the President of the United States, Freemans reactions are a healthy mixture of boredom, annoyance, disinterest and exhaustion. More of the latter actually, considering that Freeman is comatose and bed-ridden for most of the movie. I almost felt sorry for such a commanding presence and talented performer to be deemed less important to the film than an elongated chase scene with an 18-wheeler. Then again he was probably given a significant chunk of the estimated $80 million budget to participate, whereas I paid $30 to fill my car with gas and then another $14 for the eventual movie ticket. Couldnt I have stayed home and napped like Morgan Freeman? I walk through the mall and notice faces passing me by, all showing a wide range of emotions: joy over a funny conversation, frustration over missing out on a sale at American Eagle, even anticipation over getting the chance to leave the mall and stop carrying so many damn shopping bags. Its fascinating to think we as humans are capable of so many feelings to express and it later made me wonder what direction Ric Roman Waugh (Snitch) gave to his actors that had them repress all possible emotions aside from.toughness? Roboticism? Constipation? Then again, the people I passed at the mall werent being forced to play out scenarios that are a miraculous combination of convoluted and mundane. Sometimes those scenarios are so boring that Angel Has Fallen would rather shake the camera and rapidly cut between characters than focus on anything. Maybe it was out of shame, like the kind felt by the guy walking behind his girlfriend carrying four Victoria Secret bags. 6 p.m. and I felt like enjoying food at the local Red Robin (dont worry theyre not a sponsor, I just like their burgers). Helping that burger go down was an ice cold glass of Angry Orchard, a bright spot on a day that was rather uneventful, before and after the cider. Its nice when the tiniest element of a daily routine is surprising -enough to be memorable, like engaging in conversation about EAs crooked business strategy with a friendly bartender or Nick Nolte sporting a Santa Claus beard stumbling into the movie from the woods to blow up soldiers for Butlers character. Sure he looks confused and overtired running through the trees garbling lines, but hey so does Butler. At least its funny to see Nolte hobble through explosions and rattle his vocal chords to say lines about being paranoid of the government putting machines on his damn lawn or whatever. Hell if The Cannon Group kept Charles Bronson shooting gang members well into his 70s, why will no studio let Nick Nolte do the same? But I finally got to 7 p.m., the start of the movie. Regardless of what I was about to endure or how little interest I showed in the movie, I was to do my due diligence as a film critic and give the movie a fair shake. The opening studio credits came up, I blinked.and then the movie was over. Somehow the entire 121 minutes of film that played before me suddenly blinked out of existence in my memory and I felt absolutely nothing from the experience. But..I just recounted specificities from the movie in the paragraphs.How did this happen? Is my mind collapsing in on itself?! WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO SAY?! Oh right, Angel Has Fallen sucked.",KCM_Doc1_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen

Who ARE all these people?

That was what I muttered to myself as I entered the first screening of Angel Has Fallen at my local cinema. It was just after 1 p.m. on a sunny Friday afternoon in late summer, the sort of stretch for which people bail on work to go for a hike or to the beach or something, but  this? The third movie in an increasingly-ludicrous series in which talking mayonnaise wad Gerard Butler has to save the day despite overwhelming odds against him? This is how youre going to spend your day? Me, I have to be here  whats your excuse?

Who ARE all these people?

Whoever they are, they got to see a movie that, while far from good, did manage to at least improve upon its execrable (and kind of racist) London Has Fallen, the follow-up to Olympus Has Fallen, best known as the Deep Impact to the Armageddon of the Channing Tatum/Jamie Foxx team-up White House Down.

Angel Has Fallen is happy to lean into the assorted tropes and clichés of the genre, featuring a convoluted narrative packed with inexplicable decision-making, totally telegraphed betrayals and meaningless technobabble jargon to go along with loads of grim grimaces and steely glares. Its not good  never good  but its better. A low bar, but there you have it.

Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, Hunter Killer) is still a top-level Secret Service agent assigned to the Presidents protection detail. President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman, The Poison Rose) trusts Mike implicitly and is even considering him to assume the position of Director of the Secret Service following the impending retirement of current head honcho Gentry (Lance Reddick, John Wick: Chapter 3  Parabellum).

Mikes got some folks in his life whod like to see him consider the new gig. His wife Leah (Piper Perabo, TVs Turn Up Charlie) likes the idea of Mike behind a desk. His old military buddy Wade (Danny Huston, IO) likes the idea of being pals with someone who has the Presidents ear. Everyone seems to think hed be a good fit.

But Mike has doubts  especially since hes struggling with the physical and psychological toll the job has had over him over the years.

None of that matters, however, when a coordinated drone attack is executed in an attempt to assassinate President Trumbull on a fishing trip. The only survivors are Trumbull, who is left in a coma, and Banning. And heres the thing  theres a LOT of evidence pointing at Mike as the one responsible for the attack. He goes on the run, doing his best to evade not just the people who are trying to frame him, but also FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith, Girls Trip), who is leading the law enforcement pursuit.

Its Mike Banning against the world, with only a few people he can trust  including people that he long ago swore never to deal with again. And the clock is ticking, with all of the lies adding up to the possibility that Vice President Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), now acting President, will take severe action against Russia, the state deemed responsible for recruiting Banning into their assassination efforts.

First things first, lets be clear  there is a lot in Angel Has Fallen that just doesnt make any sense. Almost from the beginning, the internal logic of the narrative is shown to be questionable at best  and it only goes downhill from there. Theres never any doubt who the bad guys are; the movie seems content to just ask the audience to play along and act surprised when the time comes. The action sequences are ludicrous across the board, from basic physics right on up.

But even in the face of all of that, theres something admirable in the willingness of the filmmakers to unapologetically embrace every formulaic flourish at which they could aim a camera. Its so lazy that its almost inspired. And again  these movies are clearly popular. My own confusing theatergoing experience aside, the previous two Fallen movies did solid box office, with the second clearing $200 million globally.

Speaking of the franchise, heres maybe the biggest question it presents: is Mike Banning terrible at his job or awesome at it? Because you really could make the argument either way and I would be prepared to hear you out. On the one hand, hes proven pretty good at saving the President, having done so on numerous occasions. On the other hand, doesnt it seem like the President tends to be in danger A LOT when Mike Banning is around? Correlation is not causation, but still  Im just saying.

Gerard Butlers doughy face is back as Mike Banning; hes giving it his off-brand Bruce Willis-all. Im not sure when Butler began his transition to dullest dude in Hollywood, but hes certainly nearing its completion. He and his empty eyes chug on through, hitting marks and remembering lines.

The rest of the cast fares a little better, but only a little. Morgan Freeman is cashing a check. Ditto Jada Pinkett Smith. Their lack of concern actually makes their performances look OK. Huston is working a bit harder. And Tim Blake Nelson kind of went for it, which was a little surprising but probably shouldnt have been. Oh, and Nick Nolte shows up midway through the movie and is low-key the best thing in it.

Angel Has Fallen marks a likely financially successful continuation of a franchise that somehow  inexplicably  continues to get up.",KCM_Doc2_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
42,KCM_Doc3_AngelHasFallen,"Ric Roman Waughs Angel Has Fallen sees U.S. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler)having returned to his home turf after a trip across the pondcontending with more threats to international security. Mercifully jettisoning the Islamophobia of Babak Najafis London Has Fallen, the film finds Mike framed for an assassination attempt on President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). And clearing his name appears to hinge, at least at first, on whether or not he learns to grapple with the physical and psychological toll of his previous exploits, as multiple concussions and spinal injuries have saddled him with insomnia and an addiction to painkillers. As a fleet of miniature drones slaughters Trumbulls security detail, its impossible not to think of Mikes early interactions with his old Army Ranger buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), the head of a private military contractor. Angel Has Fallen introduces Wade openly lamenting that Trumbulls efforts to stop war profiteering have hurt his business. Its almost to the films credit that Jenningss guilt is never in doubt, meaning that Mikes subsequent escape from custody and quest to clear his name are rooted solely in his having to contend with his traitorous friends private army, and not some dull mystery centered around who set him up. Still, the films framing of Mike as the most wanted man in America is clumsily executed. Given that his face is plastered on screens all over the country, youd think that the man would be trying to avoid public exposure at all times. In practice, though, Mike is almost always in plain sight, never making any attempt to disguise himself, almost as if hes aware that no one ever seems to recognize him. The only exception to this rule is when hes held up by two armed, backwoods militiamen in Angel Has Fallens most baffling scene; after all, when one imagines the sort of people who might be driven to an outraged citizens arrest over an attack on a liberal, black president, one doesnt immediately think of white nationalists. Given the lack of significant impediment to Mikes movements, the film allows plenty of space for action thrills, but Waugh seems to have cobbled his set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection. And because of so much coherence-defying shot continuity, its impossible to tell whats happening during any given skirmish. Even the nonviolent scenes are jittery and aggressive; a close-up at one point tracks a character picking up a phone with a whip pan so fast that the shot slips out of focus. Worst of all, though, are the special effects that mark the more grandiose set pieces, with smoke from massive explosions hanging statically in the air as a giant, solid mass and, in the films rooftop climax, the obvious use of green screen revealing image artifacts around the actors faces. It doesnt help that, three films into the Fallen series, Mike has almost paradoxically lost some of his dimensionality as a character. In an age of impossibly conditioned physiques, Butlers everyman image is a welcome throwback to the action stars of yore. But he doesnt radiate much wit and personality, delivering Mikes punchlines with the same leaden severity that he does the films exposition. Butler portrays Mikes dire health condition with nothing more than the occasional flutter of his eyelids and a momentary stumble, and what could have given Mikes quest to clear his name added urgency is swiftly abandoned as soon he goes on the run, evincing as he does no visible signs of suffering from any malady or trauma. The only time that Angel Has Fallen exhibits any spark of inspiration is when Mike hides out with his estranged, traumatized veteran father, Clay (Nick Nolte), whos secluded himself in a cabin in the deep woods of West Virginia. When Jennings inevitably finds his prey there, Mikes efforts to take charge are overridden by Clay tripping a number of booby traps, setting off so many explosives that the sequence, for the way its initial teiousness blooms into improbable hilarity as each successive explosion dispatches one of Jenningss men, comes to suggest a brutal iteration of the famous rake gag from The Simpsons. Nolte, with his gravelly voice, bent frame, and matted briar patch of hair, communicates in a few scenes all of the pathos of weariness and trauma that Butler fails to invest in Mike, providing Angel Has Fallen with its only sources of comedy and emotional resonance.",KCM_Doc3_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
43,KCM_Doc4_AngelHasFallen,"There is a certain mindless pleasure in the Fallen movies. Watching Gerard Butler muscle his way through increasingly preposterous obstacles as a Secret Service agent can be amusing and oddly transfixing at the same time. Its mass entertainment that makes a courtesy stop in theatres before ascending to its true calling: endless cable reruns. But whatever this franchise got away with in Olympus Has Fallen and then, miraculously, in the totally unnecessary and very unintentionally silly sequel London Has Fallen, its clear that the well has run dry on this idea and character. Butler and the filmmakers sleepwalk their way through Angel Has Fallen, the third, and hopefully last, visit with agent Mike Banning. This time, the powers that be have decided to make Banning a fugitive. Hes on the run after being falsely accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt on U.S. President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) that kills 18 Secret Service agents and leaves the commander in chief in a coma. There is a dizzying amount of plot thrown at Angel Has Fallen. Banning has a toddler daughter with wife Leah (Piper Perabo, subbing in for Radha Mitchell in the thankless worried wife role) and hes considering scaling back from dangerous field work for the sake of his family and his own health after too many concussions on the job. The Oval Office is having issues with someone leaking false information to the press, not to mention the looming threat of Russia, who were told meddled in a recent election in the Fallen world. And then there are the private contractors, like Bannings old military friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), who are longing for the good old days of lucrative wars and government contracts. Oh and Nick Nolte, playing Bannings estranged father Clay, is living off the grid in the woods and having some regrets about leaving his wife and young child some years ago. These threads are all thrown together in this kitchen sink of a movie that is unforgivably dull for having so much going on at all times  and I havent even had the opportunity or reason to mention that this film also has Tim Blake Nelson playing the vice-president and Jada Pinkett Smith as the FBI agent who is leading the hunt for Banning. Its too much and too little at the same time, and neither absurd nor exciting enough to maintain an audiences interest for two hours. Nolte is the only real saving grace as the wild-eyed and paranoid Vietnam veteran living in his little bunker in the West Virginia woods. Hes the only one having fun with this material, but even so gets unceremoniously demoted for the final set-piece (although he does pop up again in a bizarre and kind of funny post-credits scene that has more spirit in two minutes than the entirety of Angel Has Fallen). Everyone else is either too serious or too bored or some joy-killing combination of the two. Directing this time is Ric Roman Waugh, a stuntman and actor turned director whose most high-profile outing in that capacity was the 2013 Dwayne Johnson vehicle Snitch. He shares script credit with Matt Cook (Patriots Day) and veteran Robert Mark Kamen (Taps, The Karate Kid). But this movie has none of the personality that you would expect from those filmmakers. The action itself feels oddly low budget and claustrophobic. Quick shots of a semi trucks headlights and a gloved finger pulling a trigger are ineffectively used to create suspense too many times. And for all its hot topics, Angel Has Fallen doesnt have much to say about military veterans, Russian interference or the lifetime effects of brain trauma. It just plops those buzz word concepts into the movie and moves on to the next shootout. It might still be passable for cable, but this series has sadly fallen into unwatchable territory.",KCM_Doc4_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
44,KCM_Doc5_AngelHasFallen,"No, you dont need to have seen Olympus Has Fallen and/or London Has Fallen to understand the eminently disposable third chapter of the Mike Banning chronicles. Its not that complicated: Gerard Butler is an elite Secret Service agent with a heart of gold and a face of raw meat, hes saved the free world a couple of times over the last few years, and hes forced to do it again. On the contrary, the only prerequisite for enjoying Angel Has Fallen  or at least for appreciating the essence of its potential appeal  is a fond nostalgia for old-school action movies. You know, the steroidal stuff that Hollywood churned out back when men were men, explosions were the only special effects that mattered, and the President of the United States going into a coma wasnt the best thing that could possibly happen to national security. Even in its best moments, the latest episode of Butlers low-rent franchise is nothing more than a feeble attempt to refurbish 20th-century shoot-em-ups with 21st-century anxieties. With some actual craft, a pinch more personality, and even a single moment that didnt feel like it was watered down from 100 better movies, Angel Has Fallen might have felt like a fond homage to a bygone era of blockbuster spectacle. Instead, it brings a mediocre series to a fittingly mediocre close, and sends the summer movie season running away with its tail between its legs. Butler, who seems almost deathly afraid of deviating from his archetype, reprises his iconic role as Agent Banning, a character defined by two things above all: His born-and-raised Americanness, and a barely concealed Scottish brogue. But Mike, like the genre his movie belongs to, is getting a bit long in the tooth. After surviving the uselessly shaky action sequence that opens Angel Has Fallen  a shoot-out revealed to be part of a training exercise operated by cash-strapped private military contractor Wade Jennings (a cigar-chomping Danny Huston)  Mike immediately retires to his SUV to pop a bunch of pain pills. Being an all-American alpha male is hard work, and those concussions and body blows are starting to add up. Mikes wife (the ever-reliable Piper Perabo, seamlessly replacing Radha Mitchell) is pushing him to holster his gun and accept a desk job running his department, but our hero is hesitant to leave the field. He still wants to feel like a man! And real men dont take high-paying administrative gigs so they can live to see their ridiculously adorable baby daughters grow up! Real men have so many spinal-cord injuries that theyre one big sneeze away from being paralyzed for life! Wade refers to he and Mike as lions. For these guys, its not about patriotism or justice so much as it is about pride. Pride is in short supply for Mike, especially after the president hes sworn to protect is nearly killed in a drone strike during a fishing trip. Played by Morgan Freeman, whos really stretching his wings with this role, President Allan Trumbull is one of only two people to survive the attack of face-recognizing kamikaze robots; Mike is the other, and hes framed for the crime. Not only that, hes accused of colluding with the Russians to do it. Timely! With a war brewing, Trumbull in a coma, and his guardian angel busy eluding a nationwide manhunt, the Vice President (Tim Blake Nelson) has no choice but to enlist the pricey services of private mercenary groups. Who might stand to benefit from that? One of the best things that can be said about Angel Has Fallen is that it doesnt even try to pretend that Wade isnt the villain; anyone whos seen a movie in the last 20 years already knows that Danny Huston is always the bad guy. Its a credit to screenwriters Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook, and director Ric Roman Waugh (Snitch) that they barely wait until the end of the first act for the big reveal. Any longer, and it would have been insulting. And while Wade isnt the only villain, the fact that Waugh always disguises the other bad guys voice means that it probably has to be Vice President Kirby, Secret Service Director David Gentry (Lance Reddick in a suit), FBI Agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith in a beanie), another member of Trumbulls staff, or Mikes two-year-old daughter, whose cuteness cannot be overstated. She cries on command, and screams with visceral panic when some of Wades men break into the Banning house. Its the best performance in the movie. Or at least it would have been, if not for Nick Nolte as Clay Banning, Mikes estranged father. Until Clay shows up in the second act, Angel Has Fallen is just a direct-to-video ripoff of The Fugitive thats clumsily punctuated with references to modern politics and digital era buzzwords. President Trumbull frets about leakers and the lack of trust in todays world. Vice President Kirby boasts about Making America Strong Again. FBI Agent Thompson demands that Mike tell her about the encrypted file we found on the dark web (a gorgeous clunker of a line in a movie thats full of absolute beauties). The drone attack is tinged with a frightening dispassion, but the rest of the action scenes  including Mikes escape from custody, and the climactic shootout in a hospital atrium  range from dull to unintelligible. Often, theyre both of those things at once as Waugh constructs the car crashes and firefights with no sense of build or rhythm. But when Mike runs into the West Virginia woods (effortlessly portrayed by the Bulgarian countryside) and turns to his survivalist dad for shelter, were offered a temporary reprieve from the bargain-bin inanity. Noltes grizzled performance, which seems equally indebted to the Unabomber and the bear from The Revenant, is just the kind of left-field genius that can save a bad film from itself, at least for a little while. This isnt the first time that someone has tapped into the comedic potential of undead Nolte, but Waugh scores points for letting the actor take center stage, and for encouraging him to have a grand ol time going ham on the henchmen that try to kill his characters son. Angel Has Fallen is the kind of movie that leaves you feeling restless and thinking about dinner long before the third act, but anyone who sticks it out until the bitter end will be rewarded with one of the greatest mid-credits sequences ever devised. Marvel should be quaking in its boots. Not because this steaming, $80 million ash heap of retro mediocrity is a threat to the companys reign, but rather because the MCU will never be able to compete with the kicker that Butlers trilogy serves up here.",KCM_Doc5_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
45,KCM_Doc6_AngelHasFallen,"American movie presidents can only make us wistful nowadays, and in Angel Has Fallen the White House is graced by Morgan Freeman himself, as President Allan Trumbull. Yes there is a god, probably also played by Morgan Freeman. Trumbull has been promoted since London Has Fallen, Mike Bannings last batshit outing, when taking on hundreds of terrorists across our capitals tourist attractions led to our favourite Secret Service agent becoming incredibly thirsty. Banning too is up for promotion this time around, to Head of the Secret Service, now the current incumbent, David Gentry (Lance Reddick) is retiring. The plot for Angel Has Fallen is signalled a mile off. Its so obvious who the bad guy is and whos in league with him I started to think I was the one being played. Theres also some really useful exposition by telephone call, in case you still arent sure, but it never detracted from my enjoyment. This is a terrific ride that careers through action movie tropes with little concern for the intricacies of a decent plot, but with a surprising sensitivity when it comes to father-son relationships. The third movie in an action franchise is the perfect point to bring on the introspection. We all know the main characters but you cant really go on blowing up huge numbers of people for the same old reasons. No, by number 3 you want to be blowing up huge numbers of people for slightly different reasons. For an anti-war film, a hell of a lot of people die: blown up, droned, blown up, burned to a crisp, stabbed, blown up, and shot. But at least this time weve moved away from the evil Middle Eastern terrorists trope  yes, to the delight of those like me who grew up during the Cold War, were back to evil Russians. Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is tired and damaged, even at the start. Hes a wounded bear, self-medicating with painkillers, unable to sleep, concussion leaving him feeling like hes underwater (cue lots of lingering shots of him looking knackered). Until the fighting starts, which perks him up no end. His wife wants him home more, his baby daughter is growing up fast, but while waiting for news of his possible new job he still takes in a full-on combat training course at a facility owned by his old Forces buddy Wade Jennings (Danny Huston). Jennings is now a military contractor, a bad sector to be in since Blackwater. Especially as in the White House, Trumbull is determined to move the Administration away from soldiers for hire fighting Americas wars, and indeed from war itself. Soon after, a Presidential fishing trip suffers a drone attack, leaving Trumbull in a coma and Banning the only survivor out of nearly 20 secret service personnel. Before Banning even wakes up in hospital the FBI have found a load of supposedly incriminating information about him. When he comes round, Banning is handcuffed to the bed  less guardian angel and more manacled mutineer. Hes also the no.1 suspect for murder and attempted murder. Who has set Mike up: Gentry? Vice President Kirby? Wade Jennings? Ethan Hunt? James Bond? Jason Bourne? (Just kidding.) Does Banning escape? Yes! And pursued by FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith), he goes off to clear his name and stop the President being finished off for good  which means visiting his old dad Clay in the West Virginian woods. Clay (a fabulous Nick Nolte) left Mike and his mum after witnessing the horror of the Vietnam War. Hes now a man who loves the simple life, except when it comes to CCTV and booby-traps, of which he has loads (one step down from the Unabomber his son calls him). Angel Has Fallen does try to focus on war and the repercussions for its young fighters, even years down the line; struggles that also tie in to Bannings own damaged body and psyche. Though welcome forays into that area are balanced out by traditionally clunky dialogue (President Trumbulls top guardian angel has fallen tonight! says a newscaster). John Wick this isnt. Wick got to clatter through Manhattan on a horse, Mike Banning steals an articulated lorry. Wick is pursued by every black-clad assassin in the world, Banning is surprised by two mountain militia men in check shirts at a petrol station. Parabellum has a scene where John Wicks real name turns out to be Jardani Jovanovich, Angel has one where Mike Bannings name turns out to be  I kid you not  Michael Banning. But within the confines of big budget, straight-up action moviemaking, Angel Has Fallen is cracking fun. Theres just enough earnestness about war to make us feel less bad about seeing so many people killed to prevent it, but not so much that we come out feeling weve been lectured at a CND rally. It never flags until the not-quite final showdown, which goes on way too long. Though the final fight, while entirely expected, is well done; I liked its weariness (and, yes, its inevitability). Piper Perabo as Mikes wife Leah has little to do beyond looking after an unbearably cute toddler and telling Agent Thompson to fuck off (not in the babys presence, so calm the fuck down, modern parents). Jada Pinkett Smith doesnt get to do much either, apart from chase Banning round the country via a series of very obvious clues, then wonder if shes made a big mistake. Shes always great but she deserves more. And do you remember how 2017 was the year of John Denvers Take Me Home, Country Roads in movies  from Kingsman: The Golden Circle to Logan Lucky to Alien Covenant? Well in Angel Has Fallen theyre constantly running around the woods of West Virginia, and the song doesnt pop up once. Id have asked for a refund if I hadnt been enjoying myself so much. Despite the fun there arent many actual jokes, though neither is it weighed down by its own ponderousness. Still, I like to think Bannings constant need to be fully hydrated is a sly reminder of his fabulous and plot-pointless Im thirsty as FUCK! line from London Has Fallen; and at one point they rather brilliantly CGI Trumbull into the real G7 Summit photocall (I bet when the other world leaders see it theyll be wishing it were true).",KCM_Doc6_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
46,KCM_Doc7_AngelHasFallen,"Authorities take Secret Service agent Mike Banning into custody for the failed assassination attempt of U.S. President Allan Trumbull. After escaping from his captors, Banning must evade the FBI and his own agency to find the real threat to the president. Desperate to uncover the truth, he soon turns to unlikely allies to help clear his name and save the country from imminent danger. Though some critics have given the Fallen movie series a bit of a hard time, I dont see what theyre seeing. I love these films. I love the action, I love the bombs, I love the armor-piercing bullets that fly at a dizzying pace. And I love Secret Service agent Mike Manning. I also love Morgan Freeman as President Allan Trumbull. Of course, you can call him President Trumbull all you want, but to me, it was President Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever, and in my view, he rarely does me wrong. In the movie, Mike Banning is a Secret Service agent who has been such an exemplary agent in the Secret Service he works the coveted slot of guarding the president. He is the President's 'Guardian Angel' thus, the title of the film. Manning is also the go-to guy sought to train the elite which is showcased at the start of the film. Shortly after the film begins, Banning is offered the potential job of any Secret Service agent's lifetime, The president offers him a job as director of the agency. Because Banning is a field agent through and through, with his own life's issues, he struggles to come to terms with working behind a desk, and hesitates in accepting the position. he is a combat soldier, a roaming lion, so to speak. Enter, the attack drones that explode on impact during a heavily guarded presidential fishing trip. Everything goes south, after an explosion-filled morning, Banning becomes the victim of a setup and the world believes he is the man solely responsible for trying to assassinate the president. It is the world against Secret Service agent Banning, who wastes no time in fighting to stay alive and on the run in an attempt to prove his innocence. Alone, half blown-up and exhausted, he seeks to find his long-lost father, that had previously abandoned the family due to his own combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder. A bit cliché you might say? Absolutely. Forgivable to have such a cliché? Absolutely. Because the film doesn't stop delivering beautifully orchestrated chaos. Nick Nolte is hilarious as Bannings long-lost dad, and I did not expect for this movie to have so much humor, but it was an excellent bit of refreshment in between bombs going off, trucks crashing into police cars, and the seriousness of the FBI seeking to find a presidential assassinate. With a bit of forethought, Im certain something a bit out of the realm of being a cliché could have been created, but why? The Fallen movies which include Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and London Has Fallen (2016) are Great in their ability to deliver action, they deliver films filled with conflict, lots of bullets, different types of weaponry, grenades, helicopters, fighter jets and more which all come together to create exactly what I love in these type of movies. Gerard Butler, who portrays Secret Service agent Mike Banning, is excellent. When he refers to his military past in the film, as a former US Army Lieutenant, I buy it a hundred percent. So much that I wonder if he was former military. As I said, Morgan Freeman is my favorite, and Nick Nolte who plays Bannings father continues to deliver one smart ass comment after another in hilarious fashion. I loved his character and loved every interaction with him and others in the film. I wasnt alone in my appreciation, my laughter was never alone, I was always joined by countless others in the theater who thought it was just as funny as I did. There were a few nice surprises in this film as well, I truly appreciated Jada Pinkett Smiths Portrayal as FBI Agent Helen Thompson, who admittedly came across as a real jerk, but the exact type of jerk you would expect her to be in her position with the FBI. I also really enjoyed Danny Huston as the antagonist Wade Jennings from the Salient Agency. Huston, in my view, does an excellent job as any sort of evil villian or antihero in the films he has played. There were a few twists and turns I didnt expect and I appreciated being thrown a curveball. I wasnt surprised when the proverbial mystery person behind the computer voice was revealed. But I am pretty good at making guesses at a films plot. So in conclusion, I highly recommend this film if you enjoy hard action, bodies flying through the air due to explosions, armor-piercing rounds throwing people all over the place and buildings exploding with hundreds of people running for their lives. Its a great action film and worthy of the price of admission definitely check it out. I give this film an 8.5 out of 10 for great action, great humor that was unexpected, and a nice hearty and satisfying conclusion.",KCM_Doc7_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
47,KCM_Doc8_AngelHasFallen,"Angel Has Fallen is what used to be called a B movie, but it delivers the goods briskly and has some resonance for grownup viewers, despite an over-the-top plot with few surprises and a director who started as a stuntman  this is the film Brad Pitt's Once Upon a Time  in Hollywood character might have made if he got an auteur break. As in the previous two films in the series, Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen, Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, who turns 50 in November) guards the president (Morgan Freeman, 82, who seems amused to be playing a president yet again) against assassins, who stage a spectacular attack by a flock of killer drones with face-recognition software. Eighteen Secret Service agents die, but (no spoiler) Banning saves the president, who unfortunately is in a coma and can't tell anyone who saved him. So the vice president (Tim Blake Nelson, 55) and the FBI agent on the case (Jada Pinkett Smith) find it suspicious that the drones recognized and spared Banning's face. And we find it suspicious that Danny Huston, 57, plays Banning's best old war buddy Jennings. Huston is more typecast as a bad guy than Freeman is as a president, and his sinister circumflex eyebrows echo his father John Huston as the ultimate baddie in Chinatown. But it's easy to relate when Jennings and Banning talk about feeling their age and resisting the pressure to retire, or to take a desk job that amounts to the same thing. We are lions! Jennings says. ""If I had my way, I would keep hard-charging till the day I die, replies Banning. Meanwhile, he's tormented by aches, pains, 15 pounds of belly fat that won't go away, concussions, migraines, and a painkiller dependency he won't confess to his wife (Piper Perabo) or the president, and his face looks like a steak somebody beat with a meat tenderizer. He nonetheless rises to the occasion, ingeniously and athletically eluding the FBI manhunt and best pal Jennings scheme to frame and kill him and the president. (Again, this is no spoiler: The Jennings betrayal comes early; another baddie serves as the third-act reveal.) The action intensifies when Banning flees to Kentucky to hide out with his Vietnam vet dad (Nick Nolte, 78), a paranoid survivalist like a less psychotic Unabomber who's booby-trapped his rural redoubt (much like the booby-trapped woods in Nolte's first great movie, 1978's Who'll Stop the Rain). Nolte's grizzled, long-AWOL dad has a merry, irascible determination, and the movie comes alive when he tussles emotionally with his son Banning and fireworks fill the air with stuntmen. Beneath the B-movie mechanics and genially over-the-top dialogue, there are grownup hearts beating in Angel Has Fallen. Butler and Nolte make you buy their mutually exasperated reconciliation. Compared to the generic characters of Nelson and Smith, they're deep, and the talented Huston really sells his buddy scenes with Banning and his ruthlessly scheming betrayal scenes, too. Though it has a few ominous topical themes thrown in (menacing tech, Russian plots to subvert America, scheming war profiteers, citizen militia bounty hunters), Angel Has Fallen doesn't really have a serious thought in its head. But it's fun, and whatever you do, don't miss the Nolte-Butler scene midway through the credits at the end. It's a comic keeper.",KCM_Doc8_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
48,KCM_Doc9_AngelHasFallen,"Any spy thriller character who hangs around long enough eventually makes it to the betrayal phase. The top guy  its nearly always a guy  is set up as the stoolie for some nefarious scheme to sabotage the agency from within, and is hunted by the government.
Bond, Borne, Smiley  its always the same thing. They find themselves on the run, having to outwit their own team. You could argue that Fallen isnt technically in the spy genre, since protagonist Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is a Secret Service agent, not CIA or something similar. But all the hallmarks are there: unstoppable combat skills, stubbornness bordering on mania, international plots and lots of cool technology able to do stuff straight out of, well, a movie. I liked the first film, Olympus Has Fallen, well enough though the sequel, London Has Fallen, got tedious and not a little overly macho. All three have the same basic plot: the Presidents life is threatened, and only Mike can save him. This time around its Allan Trumbull, played by Morgan Freeman with signature gravitas In most movies like this, the action scenes propel you onward and the slower talkie sequences are what you must suffer through to get back to the pyrotechnics. This time around I was impressed by the downtime more than the parts with flying bullets.
Piper Perabo is an empathetic presence as Mikes suffering wife, put through hell along with their baby girl when he is fingered as the culprit behind an elaborate assassination attempt on Trumball. Freeman spends most of the movie in a hospital bed, but when he was not I was reminded why its pleasing to have a man who is seemingly so wise and kind as POTUS. I really was touched by Nick Nolte as Mikes long-lost father, Clay, whom he eventually turns to when the chips are down. Clay ran out on the family a long time ago, and is stuck doing the crazy-loner-in-the-woods thing. But Noltes wet, pleading eyes, along with a couple of solid speeches about his motivations, genuinely hit the heart. Quality acting in a dumb blow-em-up flick? Imagine my surprise. The rest of the story is fairly forgettable, though it moves along at a nice clip under the direction of Ric Roman Waugh, one of the first stunt coordinators to move behind the camera. He co-wrote the screenplay with Matt Cook and Robert Mark Kamen. Danny Huston plays Wade Jennings, an old Army buddy of Mikes who now runs his own training facility with a hand-picked crew of mercenaries, and OMG if you dont know where thats going then you must not have seen Danny Huston in any movies over the past 20 years. Seriously, Danny, get a new agent. Otherwise your first scene might as well come with a title card like the silent movies: The villain has arrived. Mikes rumored to be in line for the directors job at Secret Service, and could steer some business Wades way. Secretly he frets about not wanting to hang up his gun for a desk job, plus his body is breaking down after years in the field, leading to some ferocious pill-popping. Jada Pinkett Smith plays the lead FBI agent hunting Mike; Lance Reddick is the outgoing Secret Service chief; and Tim Blake Nelson plays the nervous nelly vice president who has to take over the reins of office while the president is in a coma. Butler is decent at the physical stuff, despite looking rather puffy and jowly these days, though the other actors have to carry him through the touchy-feely stuff. He looks like his skin is sliding off his skull and all gathering around his neck. I think the filmmakers were trying to make him look like crap, but also they went that way because thats the clay they had to work with. Butler seems poised to take over the Kickass Geezer mantle thats been passed down from Harrison Ford to Denzel Washington to Liam Neeson. Filled with some decent action sequences and even a few well-plucked heartstrings, Angel Has Fallen surprises as the best of the trilogy.

49,KCM_Doc10_AngelHasFallen,"Butler delivers a good performance as Banning in Angel Has Fallen as he explores the vulnerability to him. Theres much less threatening posturing from him in this film as Banning has to face the reality that hes not as spry as he used to be. The personal problems in Bannings life gives Butler room to stretch out more and he does well showing a more human side to the secret service agent. The film tries to deconstruct the aging action hero trope and does so fairly well through him and Danny Huston, though it still doesnt go as deep as it could as it just scratches the surface of Bannings ailments. Of the rest of the cast, Danny Huston carries his usual charisma in the film as one of Bannings oldest friends. He and Butler share some good scenes early on that establishes their relationship well as both actors work nicely off each other. Adding to Bannings personal problems is Nick Nolte as his reclusive father Clay, a man so scarred by war he abandoned his family and prefers living off the grid in the middle of nowhere. Nolte adds some fun elements to the film as Bannings father and is used to further examine the various tolls men like them take through their professions, offering himself as a twisted reflection of Banning. Nolte and Butler share some pretty good chemistry together and while the role is one of the more light-hearted points of the time at times, Nolte knows when to pull back and focus on the seriousness of Clays mental state. Of the rest of the cast, the returning Morgan Freeman as the now-President Trumbull isnt actually in the movie a whole lot, but Freeman delivers his usual amount of gravitas with the limited screentime he has. Replacing Randha Mitchell as Bannings wife is Piper Perabo, who is paired well with both Butler and Nolte as she adequately picks up the torch and plays a more sizeable role. Jada Pinkett-Smith joins as Helen Thompson, the FBI agent charged with capturing Banning, but shes not given very much material to work with. In fact, the film seems much less concerned with the hunt against Banning that it and Pinkett-Smith almost become a non-issue, especially in the latter half of the story. On that note, the films story flows well enough, but it progresses much slower than either Olympus or London Has Fallen. Part of that is to account for the deconstruction of Banning and part of it is because of the nature of the plot. Unlike the previous films, Angel Has Fallen relies less on huge spectacle to move the plot along with the bad guys playing things much more low-key until the third act. Some aspects with the story could have been better fleshed out though, such as the hunt against Banning as the initial conclusion of his guilt comes pretty fast and Agent Thompson looks increasingly more foolish with some of the choices she and the FBI make. Given the fact of Bannings service and actions in the franchise, it would be hard to believe hes responsible for the assassination attempt, but that is hardly brought up at all. Angel Has Fallen does attempt to rise above the typical save the president formula as it includes more intriguing aspects to the story. It gets pretty topical at some points as it talks about subjects like election meddling and paramilitary forces. The change is actually a bit refreshing since the villains add a bit more to the plot, though the commentary on current American or global politics doesnt come close to scratching the surface. Its also predictable as its very easy to call who is setting up Banning and really plotting Trumballs demise. The film doesnt keep those cards close to its chest nearly as well as it thinks it does. Despite the lack of depth in some of the story, the film is still fairly entertaining even with the slow burn it employs. Director Ric Roman Waugh crafts some cool action scenes, particularly in the third act, and uses explosions galore throughout the film. Theres one sequence at the midpoint where Nolte sets off explosives for what is likely a solid minute of explosion after explosion. The only weakness of the action scenes is that the choreography and editing could be better. Bannings initial escape, for instance, is so dark and uses a lot of quick cuts that its very hard to follow. That unfortunately applies to some of the action in the third act as its difficult at points to tell who is who or what exactly is happening. Considering how well the action was done in Olympus and London, Angel Has Fallens action doesnt quite stand up to what its offering. By changing the formula with the nature of the villains and its examination of Bannings personal struggles, Angel Has Fallen tries to elevate itself beyond the typical set-up of the franchise and for the most part succeeds in that regard. Butler gives a good performance as he explores new layers to his Secret Service hero while, in most cases, the supporting cast compliment him well. Where the film doesnt shine as strong is in some elements to the story and action, creating an entertaining if flawed film that doesnt live up to the franchises best moments. It certainly adds to the franchise and character of Banning, but Angel Has Fallen falls short of its lofty goals.",KCM_Doc10_AngelHasFallen,KCM,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
20,JDB_Doc01_DespicableMe3,"As former super-villain Gru (Steve Carell) tries to acclimate himself to his new role as an agent for the Anti-Villain League, his wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) attempts to assimilate herself into family life, to be a nurturing mother to their three adopted children, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Nev Scharrel). When child actor-turned-jewel thief Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) once again evades Gru and Lucy during an extravagant heist of the worlds largest diamond, replacement head of the AVL, Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate), fires them both. While the two contemplate their next career path, Gru receives word that he has a long lost twin brother who wishes to meet him. Intrigued by the prospect of a sibling, Gru and his family head to Freedonia (perhaps an homage to the nation from Duck Soup) where his brother Dru tends to the biggest pig farm in the land. But its not long before his newfound relative steers him back into a life of crime, just as Lucy and the children find themselves embroiled in their own wild adventures.
Thats not a monster! Thats a man wearing shoulder pads! Its somewhat amusing that a growth spurt and the uncomfortable complications of puberty are the catalyst for the villains turn toward villainy, but the humor concerning antagonist Balthazar Bratt stops there. His costuming, his flamboyant movements, and his general design (essentially an 80s rock star shoved into a tiny, shiny getup) arent funny by themselves. Nor is his voicing by Trey Parker (co-creator of South Park), who doesnt do anything recognizable, or particularly notable, or even obnoxious like Carells exaggerated accent. Supplementary elements give Bratt more purpose, but only through his robot sidekick and his inventions (such as expanding bubble gum traps that appear reminiscent of technology seen in The Incredibles).
From a silly dance fight to the nonstop pop music accompaniment, Despicable Me 3 continues to do exactly what the franchise did before: childish absurdity. Even Grus voice is as annoying as ever. This time around, since most of the supporting characters return, there are simply too many roles to include, which makes a plethora of subplots weigh on the pacing. The primary twin angle allows for traditional bouts of competition, rivalry, and jealousy, while also setting up the majority of the slapstick and notes on brotherly love and cooperation; a Freedonian boys (Adrian Ciscato) cheese-based betrothal to Margo lets Lucy explore her new role as a mother; an incessant pig motif generates some extra visual gags (though an overweight gem expert, looking like an extreme caricature of Gerard Depardieu, is the best of the designs); and a unicorn-hunting expedition teaches about expectations and compromises. Some of these sequences work, but most do not work well together  generating abrupt shifts, particularly with Bratt, who spends most of his screen time alone, behaving peculiarly. Basically, due to the abundance of returning characters and new players, too many unrelated stories were crammed into a single film.
Fortunately, the Minions are used in proper doses to break up the slower, less interesting digressions. Unlike when they were in their own movie, Despicable Me 3 isnt burdened by having them appear in every scene; instead, they show up intermittently, specifically for some humor or for grander asides to showcase their lovable routines  such as dancing and singing in their French-like gibberish. But even with the Minions as dependable sources of laughter, this series is proving to be almost exclusively for young audiences. Fun-loving, scatterbrained, juvenile misadventures do not provide much substance for adults who are accustomed to the higher standards and more profound storytelling of Pixar  though Minion nudity is good for giggles and seems to transcend its own obvious immaturity.",JDB_Doc01_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3
21,JDB_Doc02_DespicableMe3,"Some animation features only have to answer one question: Do they make you laugh? Another one might be: Do they entertain you? And for the most part, I seem to recall finding Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 fairly entertaining and funny, with the Minions spinoff less so on both counts. The story on any of these movies hardly matters, but the emphasis has tended to be about family, or at least the family to cobble together to help make you a better person. And over the course of the first two films, the supreme villain Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) has amassed a wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and three daughters, who are all quite adorable. With Despicable Me 3, Gru adds a new member to his growing clan, a long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Carell), who he didnt even know about until this film. And when he confronts his mother (Julie Andrews) about it, she confesses that when she split from his father, each of them took one of the twins to raise.
Despicable Me 3 opens with what I guess is supposed to be a news piece about the growing threat of a villain named Balthazar Bratt (South Park creator and main vocal talent Trey Parker), a former child actor who played a character meant to be the worst kid in the world. But when his voice broke upon hitting puberty and he stopped being cute, he snapped, taking on the identity of the Bratt character and committing actual acts of evil, such as setting loose every-expanding bubble gum bubbles that push every person and building in its path out of the way violently. He also fancies himself a competitive dancer and insists on having any number of 80s pop tunes playing while he carries out his acts of destruction.
In an attempt to steal the worlds biggest diamond, Bratt is thwarted (but not caught) by Gru and Lucy, but the new boss of the Anti-Villain League, Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate), isnt happy that Bratt got away, and she fires them, leaving Gru with a lot of time to spend with his family. And then Dru enters to picture, with a full head of golden locks, dressed all in white, and just being generally agreeable and hugely successful. But the two get along splendidly and even being working together.
But I know all you people care about are the damn Minions, who naturally return but in a slightly different capacity. Most of them assume that when Gru gets fired from the AVL that hell return to his villainous roots. When he doesnt, many of them quit in protest, in the hopes of finding a better boss. When they arent the stars of their own movie, the Minions are still very funny.
Many members of the key creative team behind the film have been working on these characters from the beginning. Director Pierre Coffin has had a hand in directing all three Despicable Me movies and Minions, second director Kyle Balda made Minions and The Lorax, and co-director Eric Guillon did character work on all four films. And its clear that their devotion to these characters and this world is real. Per usual, the film are family friendly, but there are a few strange little, almost throwaway lines that get downright subversive. Part of that is the cast. Carell, Wiig and Parker have all worked in the R-rated realm, and while theres certainly none of that present, there are a few moments that dance up to the line and pull back at almost the second you think something unseemly is going to happen. It adds a bit of electricity to the proceedings.
Despicable Me 3 isnt going to win any awards, but its frenetic energy and dedication to adult-level silly is admirable, so much so that its easily the best of the bunch. Its goofy, funny, catchy like pop songs, and has a lot of great things to say about embracing and expanding your definition of family. You could do a lot worse in the search for family entertainment, believe me.",JDB_Doc02_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3

This third window into the life of loveable curmudgeon, and mostly-reformed villain, Gru continues exploring its familiar themes: the meaning of family, non-biological parenthood, loyalty, and (surprisingly) nature vs. nurture.
First, I want to say Im here for any movie that highlights that families can be made in so many ways. Gru is still a doting father to his three girls: Edith, Agnes, and Margo. His fatherhood isnt even a question. They are his girls and since the first movie my dude has been willing to risk his life for them. Lucy, however, is still trying to figure out what it means to be a (step)mom. We spent a fair amount of time in DM2 looking at what it means to be a kid who has never (to our knowledge) had a mother. And we ended that movie, of course, on the up note of Agnes reciting a poem about moms while Lucy fought back tears.
The biggest twist on family here, though, is the introduction of Dru, Grus long lost twin brother. Who has hair. And is (kind of) evil. And has hair. Drus desire to be as evil as Gru once was helps drive the plot as the brothers engage with Balthazar Bratt, the big bad in this installment. This child star turned adult villain brings humor and the necessary evil that Gru and Lucy must fight against. But so much more importantly, hes the reason/excuse for the soundtrack to be sprinkled with that 80s goodness.
What I wouldve liked more of from this movie was attention to plot detail. Yes, I know its a kids movie, but lets be honest: Im going to end up watching it probably 50 more times once the DVD comes out. Dr. Nefario is conveniently sidelined without much explanationbut with nerd reference as a consolation prize. We dont get closure on what happens to the Bratt at the end. Hes a villain, so we assume hes defeated. But maybe hes dead? Or maybe he escapes? There are a few other minor characters who dont have their plot points resolved, but we are left to assume everything worked out okay because of the genre.
What this movie did absolutely right was juggle storylines. We get Gru and Dru figuring out who they are as brothers and what that means. We get Agnes searching for mythical creatures. The minions are in these streets doing their own thing. Lucy is, as I said, working out the dynamics of being in a blended family. And we, of course, have the good vs. evil that leads the entire franchise.
Overall, this is a fun movie in a fun series. They definitely left the door open for a fourth movie and Ill definitely go see it when it comes out.",JDB_Doc03_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3
23,JDB_Doc04_DespicableMe3,"Although Readers at IMDB.com and the critics at Rotten Tomatoes thought otherwise, Despicable Me 3 is just as entertaining as the first sequel to Despicable Me (2010)the animated feature from Universal that introduced us to the carrot-nosed Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), a villain who was softened up by three orphaned girls.
By the third installment, Gru has gone straight and has been working for the Anti-Villain League with his partner/wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig). Because they failed to capture or eliminate Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a maligned child actor who, as a resentful adult, is driven to become the worlds biggest villain, Gru and Lucy find themselves kicked out of the League. But of course that doesnt stop them from tangling with Bratt (aka Bad Boy Bod) again and somehow managing to save the day. Thats no spoiler: its what superheroes and crimefighters do.
How much you enjoy Despicable Me 3 may depend on how much you like Grus minionsthose capsule-shaped little yellow guys in blue overalls that speak in their own gibberish language. This outing the minions arent integral to the plot and only seem deployed in several overly cute (and overly long) sequences designed to satisfy those who do love the little guys, and, of course, to keep those Minion toys and product tie-ins flying off the shelves. They mattered much more in the first two films. Here, theyre as gratuitous as nudity in a teen slasher movie. Also marginalized this film are the three orphaned girls that Gru adopted in the first film, so if you thought Mr. Despicables interaction with those girls a strength, youll be disappointed to find them underused in Despicable Me 3.
Dominating this entry are Grus interactions with the villain and a twin brother he never knew he had until recently. Carell also gives voice to Dru, the seemingly perfect (and fabulously wealthy and successful) twin from whom he was separated at birth. Reminiscent of the 1988 comedy Twins, in which the genetically perfect Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, the twin made from DNA leftovers, discover each other, Despicable Me 3 features one twin who is predominantly evil and the other predominantly good. The complication, we learn, is that the successful twin was as much of a disappointment to the villainous-at-heart father who raised him as Gru was to his goody-goody mother. How the brothers learn to cope with who they are and how they were raised, and how they learn to deal with their Other gets the lions share of narrative attention. And frankly, the twin brother angle probably rescues the third installment from a familiarity that can make sequels seem tedious.
Are there Disney-style wholesome messages implanted here? Sure, if you consider that good triumphs over evil. Despite a large dose of sibling rivalry (that children with siblings can certainly identify with), there are also moments of true caring and brotherly love that shine through. If the voice of Grus mom sounds familiar, none other than Julie Andrews is behind the microphone, while Miranda Cosgrove and Dana Gaier return as the voices of adoptees Margo and Edith and Nev Scharrel replaces Elsie Fisher as Agnes.
The animation is as accomplished as anything weve seen from Universal, with artists and animators strutting their stuff in a string of grand-scale action scenes that are comparable to what were seeing these days in live-action superhero films. Despite a PG rating for action and rude humor, nothing here is terribly offensive (How upset can you get when a villains weapon of choice is bubble gum?) and theres less palpable tension in scenes with characters in danger than a Disney superhero film like The Incredibles. Its a pretty family-friendly package, with plenty of laugh-out-loud momentsmany of them involving minor characters and sight gagsand a lot of color and activity on the screen, all of it looking wonderful in 1080p HD.
While at first glance there appears to be a bunch of bonus features, none of them runs longer than seven minutes. The best is probably The Secret Life of Kyle, a cartoon short featuring Grus pet dog. Yes, even the dogs are getting into the act. This franchise is still going strong, with Minions 2 slated for 2020 release and Despicable Me 4 projected for 2024.",JDB_Doc04_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3
24,JDB_Doc05_DespicableMe3,"Im confident that the minions would gleefully follow Chris Meledandri, Janet Healy and Chris Renaud anywhere this dazzlingly creative group would go!
In Despicable Me 2, Gru met his soul mate Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) and they married. A quick roundup of the current Despicable Me 3. Now the reformed super-villain Gru (Steve Carell) agrees to change his life to make a better way for his three newly adopted daughters. And Gru discovers his long-lost twin brother, Dru, giving the reforming villain one more reason for a massive group hug!
Once the two long-lost brothers unite, this action-packed comedy moves swiftly into a hilarious family film that stresses those old-fashioned family values but in an utterly original way.
Old Gru has unfairly lost his job with the Anti-Villain League and his twin brother Dru desperately wants to get into the villainy racket to keep alive, we discover, the family legacy.
Gru and Dru are like table tennis players bouncing the running gags with speed and precision.
The villain making trouble is the disgruntled former child star named Balthazar Bratt (voiced by South Park co-creator Trey Parker)a humorous relic of the 80s, when everyone knew and loved him from a show called Evil Bratt. Lost to his past, Balthazar wears huge shoulder pads and pump sneakers, tossing explosive bubble-gum bombs and break-dancing his way through complicated heists. He watches tapes of old episodes for ideas, corny but effective, and we get to hear his taglineover and over againIve been a bad boy!
Balthazar manages to steal the worlds largest diamond and Gru and Lucy set out to stop him and to earn back the respect of new boss Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate). While Gru and Dru make up for lost time and test out a slew of new gadgets that would make any villain proud, Lucy attempts to bond with the three little girls, who each have subplots of their own, the funniest being Agnes obsession with finding a real live unicorn.
As silly and delightful as Despicable Me 3 is, there are sentimental and warm-fuzzy family moments delivered with genuine sincerity. The true Awwww moments come when the youngest daughter Agnes tells adoptive mother Lucy, I love you, Mom.
The audience remains invested because the story keeps them glued. Thats the work of writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, whove been with the series since the beginning. This is complicated comedy, and for those of us who study structure, I suggest that you get a copy of the screenplay and pour yourself into learning their secrets.
Despicable Me 3 is part of a franchise that has already earned more than $1.5 billion worldwide, and thats not counting merchandising or the Minions movies additional billion. The uber intelligence of the team leaves this installment open-ended for an unending number of sequels. Jump up and down with glee. The minions will continue to bring the giggles for the next 50 years, I wager.
Along with the fast flowing jokes there is Heitor Pereiras spirited score and five new songs by Pharrell Williams including the sweet, Theres Something Special.",JDB_Doc05_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3
25,JDB_Doc06_DespicableMe3,"At what point to film series and franchises begin to lose their bite? Despicable Me 3 aims to answer that question and the result is not what the studio is anticipating.
In 2010, Illumination Entertainment stumbled upon a premise that would lift its stock to a point not far below the greats of Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks. Their concept of an archvillain using children as pawns, but discovering a genuine affection for them was a novel concept in animation and the end result was a warm, sweet exploration of fatherhood and family.
Three years later, that films immense popularity led to a continuation of the story where Gru (Steve Carell) falls in love with a secret agent (Kristen Wiig) while his family is threatened by the machinations of a new villainous threat. The film was a solid effort, but began showing signs of limited potential. Gru was turned into a good guy and his nefarious schemes felt like an ever-present, but modestly distant memory. The familial joy was there, but a bit diminished. It was enjoyable, but not as moving as the original.
They followed this with an ill-advised prequel based on the popular pill-shaped Minions of the first two films. These critters speak in a language only they can understand, but which the audience can pick up contextual and visual clues to comprehend. This slow-moving film was a decided downward collapse of the series and laid the groundwork for concern over its future.
Now we come to the fourth film of Illuminations bread-and-butter franchise and it is a direct continuance of the characters and storylines of the second film. This time out, Gru and Lucy are in pursuit of a former child star-turned-villain (Trey Parker) who has plotted to steal a massive pink diamond. To complicate matters, Gru discovers that he has a long-lost twin(ish) brother named Dru. Dru always wanted to be the supervillain Gru was, but had to satisfy himself with playing spy in his own mind and with the vast wealth his father left him.
As Dru and Gru explore their fraternal relationship, they must work together alongside Lucy to break into Balathazar Bratts heavily-defended compound and retrieve the purloined gem while bonding in the process. Many antiquated tropes of the spy and thriller genre, such as the family-in-distress dynamic, are on full display here and the machismo that has permeated the series threatens to undermine the jovial and friendly atmosphere the series once reveled in.
Pierre Coffin, who has been a part of the production, directing, and writing team since the beginning, has been shepherding the franchise towards its massive box office takes and popular approval, he has seemingly forgotten what had made the original film so special. That sense of emotional and paternal growth felt genuine and irrepressible. Now, it feels gratuitous and inconsequential, tacked on to tie it into the previous films, but lacking the sincerity.
This fourth incarnation has lost its way. Paying lip service to its own origins and haphazardly connecting to the past films, it is thankfully a step up from the incongruous and dull prequel. However, even as an improvement, its a pale shadow of the original featuring some endearing and humorous moments, but lacking the depth and creativity the series once employed. Despicable Me 3 is an entertaining slip of a film, but its not a movie that commands respect or demands for future outings.",JDB_Doc06_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3
26,JDB_Doc07_DespicableMe3,"I never thought Id complain about a Despicable Me movie having too much plot. Pierre Coffin and Kyle Baldas latest entry in Universal Pictures unexpected franchise juggernaut feels less like a single movie than a jumble of half a dozen unrelated subplots, all vying for screentime, all struggling to rise above a general vapidity established by animation studio Illumination Entertainments title card which features not one, but two different fart jokes. This is screenwriting by way of Brian Enos Oblique Strategies card set. The miracle isnt that the film manages to wrangle a handful of these subplots into a semi-satisfying finale, but that it manages to transcend its own mundanity for moments of genuine warmth and cleverness. But, oy, theyre so few and so far between.
Subplot #1: retired criminal mastermind Gru (Steve Carell) and his new wife Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) get fired from their job as agents for the Anti-Villain League after failing to apprehend Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former child star gone insane who steals the worlds most expensive diamond.
Subplot #2: Gru discovers he has a twin brother named Dru (Carell again, delivering his lines seemingly after a swift kick in the nads), a pig baron on the vaguely European island of Freedonia, a mishmash of German accents, swarthy Italian grandmothers, and French turophilia. Dru asks Gru to help him become a great super-villain. (And before you ask, no, despite naming the island Freedonia, Coffin and Balda dont include a SINGLE Marx Brothers reference!)
Subplot #3: Lucy struggles to adjust to her new role as mother to Grus irascible adopted daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Nev Scharrel).
Subplot #4: After a terrible cultural misunderstanding, the 12-year old Margo finds herself engaged to a corpulent Freedonian boy.
Subplot #5: Edith and Agnes travel into the forests of Freedonian to capture a unicorn.
Subplot #6: Frustrated with his abandonment of villainy, the Minions quit their jobs as Grus henchman and, through a wacky set of circumstances, find themselves locked up in prison.
Honestly, the biggest surprise in Despicable Me 3 is that the Minions didnt have more screentime. After the preposterous $1.159 billion in profits made on their stand-alone spinoff movie Minions (2015), one would assume this film would be a shallow pretense for 90+ minutes of Minion shenanigans. But Coffin and Balda keep their scattershot focus on their human characters, with mixed results. The scenes with Lucy and the girls (or gy-urrrllls as Dru pronounces in his Slavic/Russian/ancient Mesopotamian accent) are the best, and as with Despicable Me 2 Wiig reveals an uncanny knack for manic yet emotionally resonant voice acting. The same cannot be said for the relationship between Gru and Dru: their scenes are the most blasé and predictable in the film, at least for people whove read enough comic books or watched enough soap operas for the Unknown Twin Sibling twist to seem old hat. And I suspect that even those who havent will find their scenes grating and tedious.
The films greatest saving grace is Balthazar Bratt, a character so preposterous and over-the-top that I wish he could get his own spin-off movie. Coffin and Balda knew damn well what they were doing when they cast Parker for the role, as Bratt is essentially a one-off South Park character and Parker plays him as such. After his hit 80s television show where he played a child super villain was canceled after he hit puberty, Bratt went insane and began to believe that he was his character from the show. So he goes about his nefarious evil-doing as a physical embodiment of the 80s. His weapons of choice are a supersonic keytar and super-expanding chewing gum, his outfit is a purple jumpsuit complemented with parachute pants and foot length shoulder pads, and his sidekick is an evil R.O.B. knock-off. He lives in a giant tower with such preposterous interior decorating that the Memphis Group would tell him to tone it down. And, most significantly, he carries out his crimes to a grooving 80s soundtrack, including the films opening heist scene where he steals the aforementioned diamond while dancing to Michael Jacksons Bad, proving that enough time has passed that we can once again use Jacksons music in kids movies. I hope he comes back.",JDB_Doc07_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3
27,JDB_Doc08_DespicableMe3,"Unlike most films in Illuminations canon, the DESPICABLE ME series is fairly dependable, gifting us entertaining stories with a hearty dose of laughter and sweet sentiments. Its too bad that the third chapter in Grus ever-growing saga, DESPICABLE ME 3 (which shouldve been called DESPICABLE M3) chose not to follow the franchises predecessors and instead resorts to the current company model: noisy, colorful animation light on heart. Directors Pierre Coffin, Kyle Balda and co-director Eric Guillons second sequel goes through the motions more than anything. That said, its absurdist, irreverent humor makes it far less despicable than it should be.
Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig) have settled into married life, kicking villain butt together at the Anti-Villain League. But theyve met their match in a mullet-sporting, purple tracksuit-wearing Balthazar Bratt (voiced by Trey Parker), a bitter former 80s child star out to destroy the town that spat him out. When they fail to capture him, their AVL bosses Silas Ramsbottom (voiced by Steve Coogan) and Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by Jenny Slate) fire them, sending them into career crisis mode. Kinda. Beyond losing most of his Minions in a mutiny, and their kids Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier) and Agnes (voiced by Nev Scharrell) worrying for one scene, this doesnt materialize dramatically. Anyways, its around this time Gru discovers he has a twin brother, Dru (voiced also by Carell). Hes rich! He has hair! He dresses in white! And hes desperate to learn the family trade of villainy  something he stinks at. If Gru can train Dru how to be the worlds best villain, its possible that they can team up to stop Bratt from being, well, a super brat.
Screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul precisely nail the brotherly dynamic  specifically during the scene at the dinner table where the two switch places, amusing only themselves. Humor works best here when it sticks to the riotously absurd and abstract. There are a few lines that had me laughing  like when Gru describes the goopy soupy concoction his daughters make, when he warns one of the girls about going to her friend Katies house and when he confronts his mother (voiced by Julie Andrews) about his dad literally dying of embarrassment on the day he was born. A handful of heart shines through, but only a handful  maintaining Illuminations motto of Were not Pixar, okay?! Deal with it. Lucys trajectory as a superb stepmom and Grus reticence to rob Agnes of her naiveté are the moments of resonance. Its just too bad there wasnt more of that, rather than more loud action.
The filmmakers over-complicate matters by splitting up the story into three almost isolated mini-stories that never blend together. The Minions go off on a tangential quest, chased by the law, competing in a singing competition (to a rousing, boisterous spin on I Am The Very Model of a Modern Major-General), landing in jail and having to bust out. Lucy learns to ease into motherhood. Grus girls have soft arcs: Margo gets entangled with an awkward kid in a foreign town whilst visiting her uncle. Its dealt with in one-and-a-half scenes. Perpetually positive Agnes quest to find an elusive unicorn doesnt have much impact at all, plateauing versus reaching a full circle moment. And, just like every middle child in every family feels, Edith doesnt serve any purpose at all.
Perhaps most problematic is that the filmmakers shift the focus onto the wrong story. This chapter shouldve been what we see in the end credits  a story about brother against brother, spy versus spy. Instead we have a story where these two work together to defeat a rote villain, who drops numerous clunky 80s references as his weapons of choice. I counted almost twenty before the opening credits began to roll. They only get more obtuse, obtrusive and cumbersome from there on out.
It may not be the best entry of the franchise, but its humor is enough to keep the series afloat  and the brand to keep raking in money, hand over fist.",JDB_Doc08_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3
28,JDB_Doc09_DespicableMe3,"Once upon a time Gru (Steve Carrell) was a chrome-domed supervillain complete with minions, an evil genius assistant, a panda skin rug in his lair and a plan to shrink the moon but that was before Margo, Edith and Agnes three orphan girls forced him to rethink his diabolical dealings and become a family man.
The theme of family continued into Despicable Me 2 which saw him as a doting single father working for the Anti Villain League with partner and love interest Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).
The family feel extends into the latest film, Despicable Me 3. As the story resumes Gru is fired from his job at the Anti-Villain League when he fails to apprehend thief (and former 80s child star) Balthazar Bratt (South Parks Trey Parker) following a daring diamond robbery.
With time on his hands Gru and family visit his long lost brother, the extravagantly accented Dru (also voiced by Carrell) in the far off island of Freedonia. Shortly after you and your brother were born, your father and I divorced, and we each took one son, explains Grus mother (Julie Andrews). Obviously, I got second pick.
As the brothers bond, Bratt gets back to work, this time managing to steal the giant diamond. He plans to use the gem to power the giant robot and get his revenge. This time Hollywood I cancel you and all the losers who rejected me!
As if that wasnt enough plot, the Minions, the curious clan of yellow jellybean-shaped troublemakers who were once Grus henchmen, are arrested after invading a TV talent show called Sing! As Dru convinces Gru to take another run at Bratt and steal back the diamond, however, the Minions escape jail and lend a hand.
Despicable Me 3 isnt exactly just an excuse to trot out the million dollar Minions but its hard to imagine what it would be like without them. Gru and Company are fun enough but three movies in, plus a Minion standalone, the human characters have become familiar, predictable. The real stars are the jellybean shaped minions who are still silly, inspired and just stupid enough to make kids laugh uncontrollably.
The animation is wild n wacky and there are several set pieces, like the henchmen singing Gilbert and Sullivan in Minionese, that are inventive but overall the film raises a smile when it is in silly mode but is less successful when it defaults to being a capital F family film, which is far too often.
Adults of a certain age will enjoy Bratts endless 80s homageshe even has an evil army called the Bratt Packbut make no mistake, this movie belongs to Grus brightly coloured little companions.
Despicable Me 3 isnt terrible, but it doesnt have the spark of the other films in the series. That lack of spark is amplified by a blatant sequel-ready ending that suggests this is simply a set up to a further adventure; an appetizer for a main course yet to come. As such, instead of leaving me hungry for more it took away my appetite for any more Gru stories.",JDB_Doc09_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3
29,JDB_Doc10_DespicableMe3,"Let's face it Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures hit gold back in 2010 when the first Despicable Me movie made its way into theaters.  With great characters, funny lines and a solid story, it delighted audiences, especially the adorable little yellow Minions.  Due to its success, it was followed in 2013 by its sequel along with the spinoff films starring the Minions. It spawned a plethora of merchandising opportunities and the Minions even have their own amusement park ride.  This year, in anticipation of the July 4th holiday, Gru (Steve Carell; The Office), Lucy (Kristen Wiig; Bridesmaids), the girls and all the Minions are back in Despicable Me 3.
After marrying Lucy, Gru turned from a life of crime to a secret agent bringing justice to the world.  However, when his nemesis Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker; South Park) slips through his fingers yet again, Gru is fired by the new head of the AVL.  Without a job and unsure of what to do, he gets an unexpected visit and discovers he has a twin brother, Dru (Carell) who needs Gru's help.  So Gru, Lucy and the girls head to Fredonia to meet this long lost family member.
Living in a big house as a successful pig farmer, Dru has a secret that their father, who Gru thought had died, was actually a successful villain.  Now that he has passed away, Dru wants Gru to show him how to be a villain but Gru explains he left all that behind for marriage and kids.  However, When Bratt steals the most expensive Diamond in the world, the brothers go on a quest to steal it back.  Along the way they have their bumps and bruises but ultimately come to an emotional reconciliation.
One thing the film has going for it is its talented cast.  Carell is excellent at his voiceover work and Gru is a well know and recognizable character.  His turn at Dru is also well done, as he makes two distinct but similar voices.  Wiig is great as Lucy and her voice has a warm tone to it that is appealing.  Parker's Bratt has a rougher edge which is perfect for the villain he plays.  Of the three girls, Nev Scharrel's (Clippings) Agnes is absolutely adorable and she manages to steal the show a few times.  Of course, those adorable little, yellow guys the Minions- are very much the scene stealers as well, though they don't appear too much throughout the hour and a half running time.
The soundtrack, filled with 80's pop tunes and original songs from Pharrell Williams, adds to the overall upbeat feel of the film and gives off an aura of general happiness. The animation is excellent but I expect no less from an Illuminations Production.  Vibrant colors permeate the screen making everything bright and joyous.
The film has a lot going for it yet, somehow, it just doesn't have the same feel as the first two films and drags a little.  While it offers up a few laughs, there wasn't enough to offset the moments that lag in between.  I didn't especially like the Balthazar Bratt character and found him rather annoying, which may have diminished my enthusiasm for the movie.  Carell has stated he doesn't know that he would reprise his role as Gru in a fourth film (but did insist he would be willing to do a cameo in future Minions movies) and I think he makes a wise choice. 
While I love the Minions and the Girls (especially Agnes) and I like the family aspect of them, Lucy and Gru, I just didn't like this third installment as much as I did the first two. However, if you are a fan and have little ones, you should take some time this summer and make a family outing to the movie.",JDB_Doc10_DespicableMe3,JDB,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3
50,JTG_Doc1_Oblivion,"Only recently, Tom Cruise looked as if he was attempting to grow twelve inches to play tall tough guy Jack Reacher; now his role-model appears to be Wall-E, the diminutive cartoon automaton left behind on a wrecked planet Earth to clean up. Sadly there's none of Wall-E's spark in this bafflingly solemn, lugubrious and fantastically derivative sci-fi which serves up great big undigested lumps of Total Recall, AI, Planet of the Apes  with little snippets of Top Gun.
Cruise plays Jack Harper, a tough and self-reliant soldier in the late 21st century, after a victorious but catastrophically destructive battle against alien invaders. He has been tasked  along with the sleek and adoring Victoria, played by Andrea Riseborough  to monitor what remains of Earth prior to humanity's final emigration, and to supervise a fleet of pilotless drone craft which hunt down hostile ""scavs"", or scavengers, hiding out on the surface.
His immediate memory has been wiped in order to prevent hostile forces getting intel from him, in case of capture, but his orders are clear in what remains of his mind. The human race is to evacuate the planet (having farmed what hydroelectric energy it can from the oceans) and then decamp to one of Saturn's moons  of all the unattractive places. But Jack is plagued with weird mental images of a romantic encounter in pre-war New York and when he finds a beautiful human survivor, Julia (Olga Kurylenko), she stirs intense memories, and it is clear that there is something the authorities are not telling him.
This movie has some beautiful images of planetary ruin and huge tracts of desert and forest with the topmost bits of famous buildings poking up. There is not much actual rubbish and detritus around of the sort that Wall-E had to deal with, incidentally: an accelerated natural growth of trees and foliage has evidently covered up all that unsightly stuff, and everything is made all the more spectacular on an Imax screen. There are futurist aircraft whooshing through the mist, or being accepted into the bosoms of colossally large mother-ships out in space, like the photorealist cover-designs of a classic SF novel. But the story itself feels numbed, directionless and dull; Morgan Freeman is entirely wasted in a sketchily conceived supporting role and director and co-writer Joseph Kosinski allows Tom Cruise to play to his weaknesses.
There is little of the knowing humour and fun we saw in the Mission Impossible films, just plenty of shots of Tom doing his Action Hero face, at the controls of his elaborate helicopter-plane-device, or dropping athletically down on ropes, or on the macho motorbike he occasionally rides around on. Could this last touch have been a suggestion from the star himself? Sometimes he will do his Relaxed face, kicking back by the lakeside log cabin he has found on Earth. Periodically he will do his uxorious-romantic smile, while showering or having breakfast or enjoying some preposterous underwater conjugal loving with Victoria in their swimming pool. Victoria herself is dressed and styled as if for Planet Stepford; it looks rather as if she is suppressing some emotional unhappiness. In another sort of film that learned, brittle smile of hers would crack and Victoria would spill a secret bottle of Percocets all over the kitchen floor before bursting into tears.
Oblivion goes on for a long time, moving slowly and self-consciously, and it looks like a very expensive movie project that has been written and rewritten many times over. It is a shame: Cruise, Riseborough and Kurylenko as the last love triangle left on Planet Earth should have been quite interesting.",JTG_Doc1_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
51,JTG_Doc2_Oblivion,"""Oblivion"" is a big sci-fi movie which takes all the ideas in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Silent Running,"" ""WALL-E"" and ""Moon"" and mixes them up. Then throws out the good ones. Then makes ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" anyway.

The movie is set on Earth, rendered nearly uninhabitable after a long war with some alien race called the Scavengers. The Scavs started it off by exploding the moon. We then amped up things with nuclear missiles and, well, welcome to Armageddon.

Now, almost all the human survivors have all gone to Saturn's moon. But two people stay behind, fighting off the remaining Scavs, repairing surveillance equipment and maintaining the machines which are draining our oceans for fuel exports.

What does this energy project have to do with Saturn's moon? Why do the two technicians live in a glamorous pad with an infinity pool, and why does the woman work in high heels? Why does a rocket suddenly crash to earth with a crew of retro astronauts, and why does the male technician keep having 21st-century flashbacks?

Your guess is as good as mine.

Actually, your guess may be better than mine, because half an hour into this mess, I began to think of more interesting things. Such as, what the hell is that sticky thing on the floor I just stepped in? Also, just how strangely, secretly revealing is Tom Cruise's career?

At first, Cruise played young men with daddy issues, older authority figures whose respect he was trying to win or whose control he was rebelling against. ""Risky Business,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""Days of Thunder,"" ""Cocktail,"" ""The Color of Money,"" ""The Firm""  it was endless and, by the time he started to get some crow's-feet, a little unseemly. Grow up, already.

So OK, he switched to playing slightly older, secretive guys who are themselves persecuted by unknown forces. ""Mission: Impossible"" was the segue (it had both a deceptive daddy figure and a conspiracy) and the plots soon thickened with ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Vanilla Sky,"" ""Minority Report,"" ""Knight and Day"" and ""Jack Reacher.""
And that's been the whole of the arc  from Daddy Dearest to You Just Say I'm Paranoid Because You're Out To Get Me.

Of course maybe the very tightly-wound star does think there are forces out to get him  just as the son of an abusive father might have once felt an alpha-male gap. But the only times Cruise has connected recently  in ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Tropic Thunder""  have been when he threw all this overboard and showed an unexpected sense of humor.

Any wit is lost in space here, though, as the seriously suspicious save-the-world hunk flies a cool hovercraft, hunts Scavs, takes a lot of showers and, of course, does that time-honored Cruise thing of running endlessly, pumping his arms and looking determined.

Determined to do what, though, is another question. There's nothing to really catch our interest here, outside of some retro-`70s movie design (the director did the last ""Tron"" movie, and fills the soundtrack with the beeps and bleeps of old video games). The landscapes are pretty, but there are no people in them.

Oh there's Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko  both of whom scored separately in ""Disconnect"" and ""To the Wonder,"" neither of whom register here. There's Melissa Leo (who literally phones in her performance, via video screen) and Morgan Freeman who is  of course  terribly wise and avuncular. The audience laughed at him.

And that was the only light moment in a movie that combines a lot of different films, yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts, as it slowly spirals toward Armageddon II. At the end, in desperation, they even send in the clones.

But honestly? The replicants have been on the scene from the start.",JTG_Doc2_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
52,JTG_Doc3_Oblivion,"Co-writer-director Joseph Kosinski (TRON: Legacy) digs all the way to the back of the refrigerator for Oblivion, taking leftover bits of The Matrix, WALL-E, 2001, Moon and Planet of the Apes, among countless other science-fiction classics, and putting them into a slick, shiny and state-of-the-art crock pot.
The results looks amazing, but most of the ideas that resonate will feel very familiar and more than a bit warmed-over.
Youll see one if not both of the movies big twists coming, and while a case could be made that Oblivion will make the boldest anti-drones statement of any fictional film this year, its a chilly movie that never draws you in enough to get fully invested in whats happening.
Tom Cruise opens the film with a head-spinning torrent of exposition, but it boils down to this: Its 2077. Sixty years earlier, alien invaders wrecked the moon, destroying much of Earth. What was left of the planet got trashed by nukes used to fight off the E.T.s, and now most of the population lives on a moon of Saturn.
The only people left on Earth are Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough, W.E.), who live in a high-tech house in the clouds and whose memories were wiped five years earlier.
He goes out every day to repair the drones that scan the earth for the remnants of the alien Scavengers; she reports their progress to Sally (Melissa Leo, with a ludicrous twang) at Mission Control. Unbeknownst to Victoria, Jack still remembers meeting up with a mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko of To the Wonder) at the Empire State Building back before the war.
Hes also built a secret hideaway in the mountains, a lakeside cabin where he can shoot hoops, listen to old vinyl LPs and squirrel away the books he has found in his travels.
One day, Jack happens upon the top of the Empire State Building, which the Scavengers are using as a homing beacon; following the coordinates being sent out, he finds a crashed spaceship, but the passengers arent aliens  theyre humans. And one of them is the lady from Jacks dreams.
This discovery sets in motion Jacks new understanding of who he is and what has happened to Earth, and Oblivion might have worked better if it werent so proud of these revelations that most audience members will figure out long before the characters do.
Kosinski is great with the doohickeys  Jacks transport, his fold-up motorcycle, that house of the future  but neither the plot nor the characters click the way they should. (And I say that as someone who actually liked TRON: Legacy.)
Cruise has to spend most of the film playing a literal blank slate, but even after he starts filling in his own memories, the character remains as vague as ever. And poor Morgan Freeman, who turns up late in the film, gets saddled with some astonishingly clichéd dialogue. (That YouTube reel of characters in dozens of movies saying the line, You look like shit, just got three seconds longer.) M83s score is mostly effective, but even it feels unoriginal, like the love child of Daft Punks TRON: Legacy music and the Inception BWAAAAH.
Theres a weirdly sexist tinge as well, with the female characters being either nefarious or inert (not to mention a triangular big bad alien presence that could have been designed by Judy Chicago). Oblivion also indulges in one of those have-your-cake endings that are so popular of late; not to give anything away, but this is another movie that promises a gutsy, powerful denouement only to give the audience a reassuring wink and a high-five.
The stink of studio notes and focus groups pervades throughout, in fact  that awkward narration at the beginning shares information that Jack offers up again later in the film; one imagines a test audience complaining that they didnt understand what was happening, and the studio deciding to overlay all that clunky exposition up front. Just a theory, but Id put five bucks on it.
If the dialogue and the concepts of Oblivion had been as fresh and powerful as its art direction, wed really have something here. Instead, its something borrowed packaged inside something new.",JTG_Doc3_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
53,JTG_Doc4_Oblivion,"In Oblivion, Tom Cruise plays a post-apocalyptic handyman who listens to 60s tunes, hangs around on a space station and lovingly brings an Earth plant to his girlfriend. So Top Gun has become Wall-E.

At least Cruise does get to fly around an aircraft again: With its round twin gun turrets and a narrow cockpit in between, it looks like a funny nose and glasses, or possibly an intergalactic brassiere. So maybe think of him as Maverick-E.

Its 2077, 60 years since Earth was destroyed when a foul breed of mysterious alien attackers called the Scavengers, or Scavs, destroyed the moon, which unleashed tsunamis and earthquakes that half-wrecked our planet. Then humankind, in fighting back, ruined the other half with a nuclear war.

But all of this is just an excuse for New York landmarks to be trashed again: The Manhattan Bridge and the Empire State Building get mostly buried, and the filmmakers cant resist the clichés of the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge, so they dont. Also, the hero has vague flashbacks of repressed memories and theres an all-controlling force sometimes represented by an evil glowing eye.

Wait a minute. You say I am having Total Recall of the Legend of the Planet of the Apes: A Space Odyssey? Then youre beginning to think exactly like a successful hack screenwriter. Watch a few movies (skip the nonfamous ones), scramble the bits together, dream up $200 million worth of effects, and youve got something you can pitch to execs who have seen exactly the same movies (and not many others). Both you and the execs are in full agreement that originality requires too much work.

Not that Oblivion isnt kind of fun; there are lots of zippy flying scenes and an adequate quantity of shootouts. Simply counting up the various rip-offs is a fun drinking game, and the effects look cool, or at least costly. Theres an eerie blue-gray glow to space-station scenes, which feature clinically minimalist interiors with a design that suggests Steve Jobs will be back by 2067  and no longer confined to just one planet.
On this space station, just outside the Earths atmosphere, that Jack Harper (Cruise) shares with his partner/lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), she is the liaison with Mission Control. (The boss is played by Melissa Leo, who does a showy and pointless regional accent.)

Jack, meanwhile, is out locating and fixing up armed drones that protect the mother ship from those rogue predators the Scavs. The drones turn out to be disappointingly poorly made: Your average Roomba is more menacing. (Their shoddiness suggests that, like Apple, Microsoft will also always be around, forever promising to get it right in the next generation.)

Each of these robo-sentries is built with an exposed dinner plate-sized Shoot Me Anywhere But Here! target that, when hit, causes instant destruction. Were these things designed by the same guy who built the Death Star? Also, when theyre about to unleash half a dozen huge machine guns on you, the drones sometimes pause, lip-smackingly, to savor the moment, which to the untrained eye looks an awful lot like these machines are just waiting for someone to sneak up behind and shoot them. Additional problem: Drones can be distracted by yelling, Hey!

In two weeks, Jack and Victoria are due to join the rest of humanity in the new colony on Saturn moon Titan, but you kinda sorta get the feeling theyre never going to get there. Jack is plagued by dreams that feel almost like memories of a meeting atop the Empire State Building with a mystery girl (Olga Kurylenko). And the lead Scav (Morgan Freeman, who looks fairly badass in a black cape), has other plans for Jack.

As directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron), Oblivion is one of those movies in which the main source of interest is simply in figuring out whats actually going on, though when you do, your reaction is bound to be a shrug. Without an exceptionally skilled director of actors (such as Cameron Crowe), Cruise cant dial up much emotion, so the two love interests for his character are two more than he can convincingly handle. He may be at home in the cockpit of a killing machine, but when it comes to displaying his humanity, hes no Wall-E.",JTG_Doc4_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
54,JTG_Doc5_Oblivion,"What do you need for the ultimate Tom Cruise vehicle? Vehicles! Check. Here Tom is mostly whizzing around in the Bubbleship, a cross between a jet fighter and a Bell helicopter that lands on three spidery legs and can also rocket into space when required. But he also has a groovy futuristic Moto Bike, a clean white chopper that unfolds in a flash, which he rides, helmetless, in shades, across glamorous deserts, when bored with the Bubbleship.
Weapons! Check. Tom has a brilliant hi-tech side arm in a holster on his hip, plus, strapped over his back, a special designer rifle. But he also has at his disposition whizzy drones, great big superfast metallic balls that zip through the sky, shoot out lasers to locate enemies and eliminate them with mighty guns that pop up from the sides of their glowering machine faces.
Lovely ladies in love with him! Check. First, theres Andrea Riseborough (31 to Toms 50, playing 37) who dotingly looks after him at home, wearing the prettiest shift dresses, preparing candlelit dinners and plunging naked into their swimming pool for slinky sex. But then along comes Olga Kurylenko (33), even prettier and more seductive, her perfect complexion completely unimpaired by having crash-landed from space after being asleep for 60 years, fondly whispering his name as soon as she wakes up. Choices, choices!
A mission impossible! Check. Tom has to save the planet and the entire human race, against all the odds. Again.
Oblivion is set in 2077. Sixty years ago aliens came to ransack the planet and the world was destroyed in a nuclear conflict. Now mankind is preparing to leave for one of Jupiters moons, once all the power has been extracted from the oceans. Drone repairman Jack Harper (Cruise) and navigator Vika (Riseborough) remain on earth to protect the installations against hostile alien scavengers, enjoying the high life meanwhile in a remarkably stylish minimalist apartment perched right up there in the Skytower.
Jack has had his memory wiped but remains troubled by dreams of a previous life, centring on a crucial kiss with glorious Julia (Kurylenko) on top of the Empire State Building. Then she crashes back to Earth  and Jack saves her from the drones that are determined to kill her. Vika is not best pleased. But perhaps the whole set-up is not what Jack believes it to be?
Oblivion began life as a graphic novel by its director, Joseph Kosinski, who has a background in architecture and mechanical engineering; his first film, the highly worked computer game fantasia TRON: Legacy, grossed $400 million for Disney. He has certainly made Oblivion look good, shot in very high-res digital, although not, thank heavens, in 3D, on huge sets (one of them a ruined version of the New York Public Library, just like The Day After Tomorrow) and in evocative landscapes, including the stunning volcanic craters and black sand of Iceland.
Its post-apocalypse chic  and, just like in much of the best science fiction, creating wondrous landscapes is the films main achievement. We now take it for granted that anything we can imagine can be pretty convincingly represented, but we shouldnt. Wonder still drives cinema and the technology behind it continues to progress.
The problem with Oblivion is the human drama taking place in these great vistas. There are really only these three characters (although Morgan Freeman makes a ludicrous appearance as the leader of a rebel group). So its small-scale, even humdrum, yet at the same time quite preposterous. Jack and Vika row about Julias arrival on the scene like any squabbling couple. There are things you need to know! he tells her. I dont want to know! she pettishly retorts. A touch of tongue-in-cheek humour would have helped but this is fantasy that takes itself entirely seriously.
Although the film is derivative (2001, Wall-E, I Am Legend, Top Gun, I could go on) and predictable (Tom goes rappelling, as he did in his last big hit, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol), it nonetheless makes no sense whatsoever in the end. This is one of those movies where, instead of totting up implausibilities (what do they eat? where did they get those clothes?), its actually more of a challenge to try to think of any way at all in which it could possibly hang together. If you like Tom Cruise, doing all those things he does best, youll certainly get lots of him though.",JTG_Doc5_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
55,JTG_Doc6_Oblivion,"Oblivion looks marvelous, in the deliciously dystopian way of so many post-apocalyptic films. Its set in 2077, after alien invaders called Scavengers (or Scavs) have laid waste to our moon, leading to cataclysmic floods and earthquakes that have ravaged Earth. The film features gorgeous CGI shots of such broken, half-buried landmarks as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building, whose observation deck can now be accessed by walking onto it from a mountain of rubble. Its the kind of film thats perfect for the Imax format in which some theaters are offering it.
Just be warned that this means its also very, very loud. One joker at a preview screening shouted, Volume! as the film was barely getting under way, to much laughter. He wasnt complaining that it was too quiet.
It ought to look good. The movie, by director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy), is said to be based on a graphic novel by Kosinski and comic book writer Arvid Nelson. Although that book was never published  and probably never will be  the mock-up of the story drew the attention of star Tom Cruise, along with not one, but two, studios. Disney, which originally had the rights, ultimately gave them up to Universal, which made the film.
Its an engrossing, if complicated and twisty, story, with plentiful sci-fi action and a provocative subtext about the nature of the human soul. At times, however, the balance between those two things feels off. Some of the fight sequences, which involve robotic flying drones mounted with guns, go on a bit longer than is strictly necessary.
Cruise plays Jack Harper, a futuristic maintenance man whose dangerous job consists of repairing the drones that patrol Earth, an unpopulated wasteland where giant hydro rigs convert seawater into energy to be used by whats left of the human race, which has relocated to a colony on one of Saturns moons. Although weve won the war against the Scavs, there are still some left, and they like to sabotage the hydro rigs and the drones almost as much as they enjoy trying to kill Jack.
He and his partner/lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who provides backup from a command center in the clouds, have their work cut out for them, but its more routine than glamorous. Were the mop-up crew, Jack says.
All is not as it appears, however. That scenario, as laid out by Jack in voice-over narration, soon starts to show cracks. The Scavs terrorist-style activities pick up, and a spacecraft loaded with humans in suspended animation crash-lands on Earth, drawn by an electronic beacon emanating from the surface. Its suddenly as if the order of Jacks world is turned upside down, including his understanding of who the good guys and the bad guys are. Even Jack and Victorias boss, Sally (Melissa Leo), who supervises their work from an orbiting satellite called the Tet, starts to seem not quite so maternal as she did at the beginning of the film.
More important, Jack starts to question his own identity; indeed, the very nature of identity itself. Its worth noting that, although Jack and Victoria underwent mandatory memory wipes that erased everything they knew before starting these jobs, Jack is plagued by strange dreams of a pre-war Earth  a time when he wouldnt even have been born  and of a beautiful but mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko).
The films big reveal is satisfying but requires some mental effort. This is not a movie during which you should fall asleep. Fortunately, theres not much chance of that. Oblivion is fast-paced and exciting.
As for the elephant in the room, it must be said that going to a Tom Cruise movie these days is more complicated than it used to be. The real-world baggage that this sometimes kooky tabloid staple brings to the screen is, for many, harder to ignore than it is with other movie stars, with the possible exception of Lindsay Lohan. That said, Cruise makes for a fine and even appealing action hero, perhaps because his character is someone without an apparent past. Its as if Oblivion is inviting us to undergo our own memory wipes before seeing the film.
If youre able to forgive and forget, Oblivion isnt a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again.",JTG_Doc6_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
56,JTG_Doc7_Oblivion,"Although Universals publicity department has asked that journalists refrain from spilling the secrets of Oblivion, the major revelations, once they arrive, will hardly surprise anyone familiar with Total Recall, The Matrix and the countless other sci-fi touchstones hovering over this striking, visually resplendent adventure. Pitting the latest action-hero incarnation of Tom Cruise against an army of alien marauders, director Joseph Kosinskis follow-up to Tron: Legacy is a moderately clever dystopian mindbender with a gratifying human pulse, despite some questionable narrative developments along the way. The less-than-airtight construction and conventional resolution may rankle genre devotees, though hardly to the detriment of robust overall B.O.

Getting the blockbuster season off to an early start on April 19, when it opens Stateside in wide release and in Imax theaters, Oblivion reps the latest test of Cruises bankability, coming mere months after he tried on a new ass-kicking persona with Jack Reacher. This time hes Jack Harper, and without giving too much away, theres an amusing, perhaps unintended existential subtext here about the somewhat interchangeable men of action Cruise has played over the course of his career. Still, the actors first foray into science fiction in eight years (if you dont count Rock of Ages) comes with a more intriguing backstory than most.

Its the year 2077, six decades after the people of Earth fought and vanquished an evil race of space invaders called Scavengers. But victory has come at a great cost. The planet is now an uninhabitable post-nuclear wasteland, and Jack (Cruise) is one of the last men still stationed on Earth, a fighter pilot/technician assigned to fend off stray Scavengers and repair the powerful drones overseeing a massive hydroelectric energy project necessary for the survival of the human species. It all looks and sounds a bit like a live-action remake of Wall-E, right down to the way the protagonist, spurred by natural curiosity and an unexpected love interest, finds himself on a dangerous unauthorized mission.

Until now, Jack has worked effectively enough with Vika (Andrea Riseborough), who guides his repair jobs with cool, formidable efficiency from the glassy confines of their high-tech home base (referred to as the Skytower, though it might as well be called the iPad). But unlike his partner, Jack is a dreamer and a bit of a poet, someone who cant help reminiscing about the past or questioning everyones future. Haunted by pre-apocalyptic visions of a beautiful mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko), he cant quite grasp why humanity, having won the war, has decided to permanently abandon its native planet for an uncertain future in space.

As he steers his sleek, pod-like aircraft over a landscape of eerie, desolate beauty, dotted with craters and radiation zones as well as lush, unspoiled lakes and valleys, Jack cant quite shake the feeling that all is not as it appears to be, despite the chipper directives coming from the mothership (represented by a crackling TV image of Melissa Leo, boasting a deceptively sweet Southern drawl). Indeed, the audience will likely have a clear sense of whats going on long before scribes Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn (working from a 2005 short story that Kosinski later developed into a graphic novel) get around to spelling things out; suffice to say the title refers to more than just the physical aftermath of Earths cataclysmic destruction.

Apart from an initial burst of neo-noir narration and a few moderately pulse-quickening action sequences, one of them set in the impressively imagined ruins of the New York Public Library, the first half of Oblivion adopts a spare, unhurried approach that conveys a powerfully enveloping sense of Jacks isolation. Kosinski wastes no opportunity to linger  and you cant blame him  on his alternately seductive and staggering visuals, richly conceived by production designer Darren Gilford and filmed with marvelous fluidity on the new Sony F65 digital camera by Claudio Miranda (following his Oscar-winning work on Life of Pi with another accomplished integration of cinematography and visual effects).

This patient narrative strategy works well enough until Jacks big questions finally start to yield answers  many of them delivered, as answers so often are, by the sage presence of Morgan Freeman  and the storys underlying thinness and predictability gradually become apparent. The superficial cleverness of the plotting, with its elements of amnesia, self-delusion and impossible yearning, at times gestures in the direction of a Christopher Nolan brainteaser (as does the surging score by French band M83, which sounds like electronified Hans Zimmer). But the lack of comparable rigor, ingenuity and procedural detail is naggingly evident, as is the almost feel-good manner in which the story explains away some of its morally troubling implications.

If Tron: Legacy offered up an eye-popping playground with more videogame potential than human interest, Oblivion, despite similarly immersive environs, provides greater moment-to-moment dramatic involvement. Cruise combines his usual physical agility and daredevil stuntwork with one of his more affable characters in a while, a high-flying dreamer trying to figure out mankinds place in this brave new world. Although much of the picture is essentially a one-man show, Riseborough locates the blood and passion beneath Vikas icy surface, while Kurylenko brings flickers of feeling to an underwritten role.

Kosinskis architectural background is apparent in the pictures suave, rounded design concepts and clean, coherent compositions, the effect of which is gloriously enveloping in Imax. Insofar as Oblivion is first and foremost a visual experience, a movie to be seen rather than a puzzle to be deciphered, its chief pleasures are essentially spoiler-proof.",JTG_Doc7_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
57,JTG_Doc8_Oblivion,"A sort of The Eternal Return played out in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic planet Earth, Joseph Kosinskis Oblivion is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action. After a captivating beginning brimming with mystery and evident ambition, the air gradually seeps out of the balloon that keeps this thinly populated tale aloft, leaving the ultimate impression of a nice try that falls somewhat short of the mark. Theres enough futuristic eye candy and battle scenes to lure the genre boys, while the presence of three important female characters, as well as Tom Cruise in good form, could attract more women than usual for this sort of fare, resulting in mostly robust, but not great, returns worldwide. The Universal release opens this week in most international territories, while the domestic bow comes April 19.
To those who might wish to avoid a film by the maker of Tron: Legacy, it should be stressed that Oblivion is a more interesting work by a good distance, an imaginative speculative piece set some six decades hence that always engages serious attention, even if it doesnt convincingly jell. In mood, a certain delicacy and the sense of isolation both on a depopulated Earth and somewhere above it, the recent film that this most strongly recalls is WALL-E, except with violence and without the humor and charm of the Pixar classic.
There have been many films set on an Earth depleted of humans, but few as visually enthralling as this one. Shot by Claudio Miranda of Life of Pi, Oblivion shares that films lovely light, nuanced coloration and virtually seamless meshing of live photography and effects. In neither film is it always possible to be entirely sure of what is real and whats computer generated, but the result is beautiful however it breaks down.
After what appear to be memory flashes of a previous life back in an early 21st century New York City on the part of Cruises Jack Harper, he and his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) wake up in what can only take the prize as the ultimate loft space, circa 2077, a perch thats the last word in minimalist chic. It also affords unobstructed views of whats been left behind after the catastrophe that saw the moon blown into pieces, which in turn resulted in earthly ruin and a subsequent evacuation of survivors to Saturns planet Titan.
Jack (Cruises second use of the name in a row, after Jack Reacher) takes daily spins down to Earth in a bladeless, mosquito-like helicopter, while the British Vika tracks his movements and coordinates with headquarters, personified on a screen by the friendly, Southern-accented Sally (Melissa Leo). The self-described mop-up crew, Jack and Sally, who get on well, have only two weeks to go before they finish up and head for Titan.
On the ground, Jack looks for any signs of Scavengers, or Scavs, who, apparently, were defeated in the great war but still provoke worries with their desperate ambushes. He also must avoid the radioactive zones, which remain hot. Everywhere he goes, however, Jack is protected by drones, fast-flying globe-like hi-tech wonders that are armed to the teeth and can reliably detect friend or foe.
Jack seems to relish being haunted by the past. He wears a Yankees cap, nostalgically wallows in lore surrounding the final Super Bowl, played in 2017, while surrounded by the ruins of the stadium where it took place and uses the upper part of the Empire State Building, which sticks out of the ground that has swallowed the rest of the structure, as a sort of home base and control tower.
Jack also is inordinately fond of a collection of highfalutin Victorian-era verse by Thomas Macaulay titled The Lays of Ancient Rome, especially the line that reads, And how can man die better than facing fearful odds. Given that Jack seems to be the last man responsible for tidying up affairs on Earth, hed better not die prematurely, though there is someone or something down there that seems bent on catching him.
The films delightful sense of apartness in the early going and the industrious way that Vika, especially, approaches her task of administering to the final business of Earth are things that cant last, especially not after Jack brings home the one survivor of a mysterious crash of a spaceship carrying several hibernating humans. Once she wakes up and recovers, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) throws a monkey wrench into life in the loft, not only because she is so beautiful (Riseboroughs alarmed reactions to her are indelibly registered) but because she is an arrival from the past, when she was Jacks wife.
Revelations of what follows are best not detailed, except to say that Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, respectively, play the intelligent and impulsive members of a rebel band that soon captures Jack and Julia. As much as Jack aspires to recapture the past, however, and regardless of Julias evident purity of intent, the renewed relationship doesnt click as intended, mostly because its tough to buy the conceit of the couple reunited after so long.
Further twists and betrayals lie in store, but they feel more like obligatory plot complications than organic to the overall story. As a result, viewer engagement gradually lessens, leading to a climax that makes for thematic sense but dramatic head-scratching.
Theres a bit too much manly stunt stuff, the better likes of which weve seen in the Mission: Impossible extravaganzas and elsewhere, but generally Cruise plays it naturalistic and low-key here, likable and to solid effect. Riseborough, who was the one person worth watching in Madonnas wretched W.E., is an inspired bit of casting as she brings prim, snappy delivery to many routine lines and irrepressible emotion to her later behavior. Kurylenko is more than plausible as a woman who would inspire recurring dreams in Jack, while Leo has so much personality that she can burst right through the limitations of her video screen-only appearances and still register strongly.
Technically, the film is a dream; if Tron: Legacy showed that Kosinski was right at home in an imaginary, effects-created world, then Oblivion reveals him as well along the road toward applying effects to even grander ends, in this case to a story he originally conceived years ago as a graphic novel that was adapted as a script by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn.
The unconventional electronic score by M83 is terrifically effective for the first hour and maybe more until it starts becoming a bit repetitive.",JTG_Doc8_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
58,JTG_Doc9_Oblivion,"Film genres have their boom years and their bust years.  Every genre has a big hit here and a big hit there every year, but, every now and then, a single year will have multiple watershed films that transcend and extend the genre.  In the realm of science fiction, the years of 1968 (2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes), 1977 (Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars), and 1997 (Gattaca, Contact, The Fifth Element, Men in Black, and Starship Troopers) really stand out historically as years were multiple films made a significant impact to the genre and not just the box office.  Time will tell, but we may have just had one go by in 2011 (Source Code, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Another Earth, Melancholia, Paul, Real Steel, X-Men: First Class, and, to a lesser degree, Transformers: Dark of the Moon). 

In this critics opinion, the very best year for science fiction in film history was easily 1982, boasting E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Blade Runner, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Tron, and The Thing.  All have gone on to be considered classics, groundbreakers, and trendsetters in their own right.  Once we finish 2013, there's a good chance this year might join that group and maybe even rival 1982.  

The ambitious (on paper anyways) science fiction slate coming in 2013 includes Star Trek Into Darkness, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Vin Diesel returning to Riddick, Will Smith and Jaden Smith in After Earth, the March flop The Host, the indie flickUpside Down, Neill Blomkamp's District 9 follow-up Elysium, Alfonso Cuaran's Children of Men follow-up Gravity, the summer slugfest Pacific Rim, the zombie blockbuster World War Z, and the hotly anticipated novel adaptations of Ender's Game and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.  ""Loaded"" is an understatement and one more of those headliners is out this weekend.  

The first really legitimate film that gets this year of science fiction started is Oblivion.  From the producers of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Joseph Kosinski, the kinetic director of Tron: Legacy (a movie I loved), Tom Cruise returns to science fiction for the first time in eight years since 2005's Spielberg juggernaut War of the Worlds.  Oblivion, against recent trend, actually moved its release date earlier from a summer release this July to late April, while some of its peers like Jack the Giant Slayer and G.I. Joe: Retribution experienced nearly year-long delays to be here in the spring of 2013.

Filled with amazing post-apocalyptic spectacle, dazzling action sequences, and a heady story of twists and turns, the challenge of Oblivion is whether or not you, as the audience, can allow the strong visuals to make up for the weak narrative.  This film will not go down as a 1982-level classic and borrows too many elements from other movies including The Matrix, Planet of the Apes, WALL-E, Tarkovsky and Soderbergh's takes on Solaris, Duncan Jones's under-seen Moon, and even a little Dark City, but Oblivion still has an unmistakable and impressive draw to it.  Like all good science fiction, this film stays serious, asks big questions, and takes us to forgivably implausible places.  That third element might sound like a knock, but that implausible creativity is what sets science fiction apart from other genres.  Science fiction is where the unbelievable comes to life.  That's this genre's ""grain of salt.""

For those who think they know all the twists of this film thanks to the supposedly-telling trailers (one, two, and three), you will be pleasantly surprised at the developments.  There are some decent curveballs ahead in the journey, some mildly predictable and others very unanticipated.  Still, a little too much is already out there, so the following will be spoiler-free.

Based on Kosinski's own graphic novel pitch with screenplay polish from William Monahan (The Departed), newcomer Karl Gajdusek, and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine, Toy Story 3), our setting for Oblivion is Earth in the year 2077.  A thwarted alien invasion sixty years earlier in 2017 has decimated the planet and destroyed the moon.  The nuclear fallout of the conflict did its fair share of the damage to make the planet uninhabitable, but the loss of the moon's gravity threw the planet's equilibrium into chaos leading to massive earthquakes and tsunamis that destroyed the rest.  While the people of Earth won the war, they have been evacuated to Saturn's moon Titan, leaving one immense orbiting space station, the Tet, to regulate the farming of energy to support Titan.

Cruise plays Jack Harper, aka Tech 49, an adventurous technician who's been stationed on the planet with his by-the-book communications officer and significant other Victoria (Andrea Riseborough of W.E.).  Monitored from the Tet by their commander Sally (Academy Award winner Melissa Leo), they are commissioned with drone repair and maintenance to protect the automated defense system tasked to stamp out the remaining alien resistance known as ""Scavs,"" and protect the Titan energy extraction. After several years on the job and a mandatory memory wipe, Jack and Victoria are only two weeks away from their end date to join the rest of Earth's survivors on Titan.

While Victoria is anxious to leave, Jack's time working on the surface has endeared him to the empty humanity and civilization that remains.  He has set aside his own little WALL-E lake house hideaway filled with mementos off the grid away from the decimation and also Victoria's knowledge.  Adding to that nostalgia, Jack cannot shake recurring dreams and visions he has of himself living in New York before the war and with a mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko) that he can't remember.

When Jack rescues that very woman, astronaut Julia Rusakova, who arrives from a crashing 60-year-old space shuttle in cryo-sleep, from the violent drones he repairs, his emotions and duty become conflicted.  Soon after, he is apprehended by an armed human resistance on the surface, led by Morgan Freeman's Malcolm Beach and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's second-in-command, that may or may not have the answers to Jack's conflict and the nature of the true enemy at work.

As aforementioned, Oblivion, from a plot and plot twist standpoint, stands on the shoulders of other science-fiction films of recent memory and takes its dear sweet time to show its cards and play its hand.  Clearly with four dominating heads at work (Kosinski, Monahan, Gajdusek, and Arndt), there were ""too many cooks in the kitchen.""  When you step back, its story is very thin and wet-pasta-flimsy, but the execution is what saves the picture.  While most science fiction movies can't carry a decent love story at its core, Oblivion succeeds with a rather touching Solaris-like connection between Jack and Julia that grows nicely.  Cruise is an absolutely solid lead, both in action and in drama situations.  As always, and its petty to still have to mention, please separate the man of Tom Cruise from the performer.  He's still one of the best actors working today.  Kurylenko just has to look good (originally that was supposed to be Jessica Chastain, but Zero Dark Thirty filled her schedule, picture that), but it's Riseborough that weaves a few tangled web strands of her own seduction and devotion that contrast well to rest of the love triangle.

Oblivion is an example where the visuals and aesthetics save a weak story.  Recent Oscar-winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi) photographs ""apocalypse porn"" from the desolate, yet striking Icelandic landscapes and vistas that are doubling as a washed-out Eastern United States.  Not a shot is muddled or out of place, between the raw nature and the impressive futuristic production design.  The movie breathes with those lonely visuals and pulses with a sublime electronic/orchestration mash-up score from French band M83.  It's Vangelis-Blade Runner epic in tone.  Like Kosinski's outstanding and inventive use of an orchestra-backed Daft Punk score from Tron: Legacy, the future of movie soundtracks takes another bold step forward.  Altogether, Oblivion is a handsome package that can't be denied.  Come to the film for the visuals and hang around for enough surprises and developments to make you feel better about the IMAX ticket price.  Once again, it's not a sure-fire classic, but it's just the start to a promising 2013 for science fiction.",JTG_Doc9_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
59,JTG_Doc10_Oblivion,"Oblivion is a competently made sci-fi action movie  something that cant be said about the majority of the genre. Though many of the prominent futurism themes can be linked back to earlier films, and a few loose ends might not be tied up with the sturdiest of knots, the structure and plot twists keep the intrigue high while the action paces itself nicely alongside the unfolding mystery. Tom Cruise makes a compelling hero and the setup is a savvy blend of dystopian invention and amnesia-induced identity loss. The list of films Oblivion borrows from is a long one, but the concepts are all executed cleverly and proficiently, resulting in an epic space opus that presents far more moments of awe than head-scratching queries.

The year is 2077 and Earth has been left nearly uninhabitable after a brutal war against an invading alien species known as Scavengers. While the remnants of humanity have been gathered aboard the Tet, an enormous pyramidal space station that will eventually carry the survivors to a new home on one of Saturns moons, technician Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain on Earth to monitor and perform maintenance on giant hydro-rigs and the protective, heavily armed robot drones that guard them. When a spaceship crash-lands nearby and Jack investigates, he rescues from the wreckage Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a mysterious woman whose appearance sets into motion the discovery of a massive conspiracy that will place the very fate of mankind in Jacks hands.

Oblivion is heady, weighty, and cerebral science-fiction, foregoing the little green man angle for a much more sinister and complex alien incursion. In terms of postapocalyptic, futuristic thrillers, borrowing randomly from The Road Warrior, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, The Matrix, and Total Recall, its a highly ambitious and largely successful twist, toying with existential and deterministic viewpoints while smartly avoiding depressing bouts of violence or sacrifice. Its focus on altering or interfering with memories is augmented perfectly by the heavily synthesized soundtrack, itself lending to the dreamlike qualities of Jacks remembrances. An engaging mystery, Oblivion forces viewers to wait nearly two hours before giving up any secrets; but to the films credit, the protracted anticipation is delightful. Mind-boggling and artistically visionary, the many answers it finally grapples with will probably raise further investigations into the various aspects less examined, but the climactic conclusion is pleasantly resolute  even if specific details can be rationalized with the term gaping plot holes.

An exemplary fit for IMAX screens, Oblivion boasts outstanding visuals that add tremendously to the scope of the project. Immense exterior shots and sets introduce the audience to a uniquely fascinating world, with unfriendly terrain, monumental wreckage, and obscured paradises. The interior designs are just as spectacular, though used much more sparingly. The obvious budget for special effects definitely helps establish and stabilize the pioneering perspective; visual wizardry occasionally substitutes for inchoate plot points. But perhaps most impressive of all is the origins of the story, starting as a graphic novel by Joseph Kosinski, who not only adapted it into a screenplay, but also produced and directed the movie. Not bad for a filmmaker whose only other directing credit is TRON: Legacy.",JTG_Doc10_Oblivion,JTG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
70,DWM_Doc1_TheLostCity,"Aaron and Adam Nees The Lost City is one of those rare movies in which, though there isnt really anything wrong with it, it still manages to fall short of being truly recommendable. Every word I can think of to describe the film is a synonym for average. Words like adequate, satisfactory, and competent come to mind. The film knows what it is and it achieves exactly that, never exceeding anybodys expectations to become something truly exceptional. Thats hardly a glowing review, but, with as many cynical, intelligence-insulting misfires as one can find in theaters at any given time these days, perhaps it should be. There can be something comforting  even reassuring  about a film that does its job sufficiently. We get what we came for and then go home, our memory of the film quickly evaporating. But at least it was vaguely enjoyable while it lasted.The story of The Lost City involves an uptight romance novelist named Loretta (Sandra Bullock) getting pulled into a treasure hunt against her will by a charming rich megalomaniac (Daniel Radcliffe). Lorettas dim-witted cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), travels to the remote island where shes being kept, intending to save her and win her heart. As the two stumble through the treacherous island jungle, they begin to fall in love, realizing that theyre stronger together than apart. This type of story has been done countless times, perhaps most notably in films like The African Queen and Romancing the Stone, but that doesnt mean there arent simple pleasures to be found within. The mismatched nature of the couple and the eventual overcoming of their differences is always a crowd-pleaser, provided the leads have the appropriate chemistry and the situation is believably dire. Thankfully, here, Bullock and Tatum develop an effortless rapport, playing off each other with ease, finding the smaller moments of connection in even the broadest setpieces. And, thankfully, many of those setpieces are organically incorporated into the story and handled efficiently. Too often, though, the filmmakers make the mistake of thinking that their audience is genuinely interested in the treasure hunt element of the story and, unfortunately, spend way too much time explaining the intricate details that should have remained simple window dressing. Its a common mistake that youll find in middle-of-the-road action comedies, and it is one of the few genuine flaws in The Lost City.None of that is to say that the film isnt enjoyable. I spent much of the film with a smile on my face, but it should be noted that I only laughed out loud once. And I suppose if there were a perfect way to characterize a fine-but-forgettable comedy, that would be it: all smiles, few laughs. It truly is a shame. All the elements are there. If only the film had tried not merely to meet audience expectations but to surpass them, confounding the cliches and surprising us now and then, The Lost City would really be something worth seeing. As it is, despite the film being perfectly competent, I dont recommend seeing it. Because you already have. Many times.",DWM_Doc1_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
71,DWM_Doc2_TheLostCity,"In a setup and general vibe that reminded me of films like Romancing the Stone, The Lost City tells the story of frustrated romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), who has had her greatest and longest success writing the adventures of the same hero character, Dash, whose old-fashioned adventures have made up a series of books that Loretta is looking to wrap up with her latest title. After meeting with her book agent Beth (DaVine Joy Randolph), she agrees to a small promotional tour but is tricked into doing her first Q&A with the male model Alan (something of a big, dumb but loyal dog, played by Channing Tatum), who has posed as Dash on the covers of all of her books. As the Q&A proves, Alan/Dash is more popular than Loretta, and she announces then and there that the series is over. As she storms out of the event, she is picked up/kidnapped and taken to meet an eccentric billionaire named Fairfax (a game and playful Daniel Radcliffe), who was pushed out of the family business, allowing him time to amass a huge collection of historical artifacts. The treasure he is currently seeking just happens to be the subject of Lorettas latest book and includes well-researched clues Fairfax wants enhanced so he can find the prized piece in a place called The Lost City. Alan happens to see Loretta get snatched up, and arranges to save her, even though he has no actual military or mercenary training. Wisely, he enlists the help of an actual mercenary named Trainer (Brad Pitt, in an extended cameo) to lead the mission. But when Trainer is taken out of the equation early on, Alan must rise to the occasion, rescue Loretta, and lead them both to safety. Directed by relative newcomers Adam and Aaron Nee (Band of Robbers), The Lost City is a bit of an obvious action-comedy that suffers a great deal once Pitt leaves the screen. But more importantly, the film also isnt especially funny. Bullock has set aside every ounce of on-screen charm shes ever possessed and just plays Loretta as a one-note grumpy, bitter, frustrated writer, who seems to miss the fact that an actual adventure is happening around her that is providing her with all of the moments her isolated life has been missing. And although she has sworn off reviving the Dash character, with the clear inspiration for her next novel playing out in front of her, shes too busy making fun of Alan to notice. The only thing worse than a humorless Sandra Bullock is Channing Tatum playing a character who lacks confidence to the degree Alan does. Hes good looking, popular, and not completely without helpful ideas, yet he whimpers and seems afraid of Loretta. What fun!  Since this is also a romantic journey, we assume there will be a few sparks between our leads, and there simply arent. That being said, a few solid laughs show up from supporting characters like Pitts Trainer, Randolphs Beth, Patti Harrison as a social media guru working for Beth, and Oscar Nuñez as a local man living on the island where Loretta and Alan are trapped. Its very easy to have Bullock and Channing cast in your film and believe you dont have to actually write anything for them to say, since you would assume their natural charisma can carry them through any scene. Youd be wrong. Of course, they grab your attention for any number of reasons, but any movie needs the foundation of a decent script. You cant Hail Mary your entire film by casting great personas and hoping that gets you through the entire production. That never works. Its essentially what the filmmakers of The Lost City have done, and it shows. Because Bullock and Tatum are naturally gifted comic actors, sometimes a joke lands, of course, but that needs to happen far more often in a work like this, and it simply doesnt. As a result, we get half-baked ideas, banter that sounds more like people just talking over each other, and sight gags that look expensive but dont really amount to much. As much as Im looking forward to Tatum making his way back into movies after a prolonged absence, I hope he does better than this moving forward. This one is a bit of a slog for all involved.",DWM_Doc2_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
72,DWM_Doc3_TheLostCity,"Loretta Sage has an interesting past. She studied archeology in school, then became a best-selling romance novelist, with 20 books published: lots of heavy breathing and exotic adventures. Shes found it harder to function, though, both in her work and in her life, since her husband died, five years ago. Her latest novel is called The Lost City of D. That book shares most of its title with The Lost City. Lorettas past becomes even more interesting present when a white-suited kajillionaire kidnaps her to help him translate some hieroglyphics or symbols or something to lead him to a legendary necklace called the Crown of Fire, located in, yes, the lost city of D. The ruins are on a tiny forgotten island in the Atlantic, the kajillionaire not very helpfully explains. (Much of the movie was shot in the Dominican Republic.) It just so happens that the tiny forgotten island has an active volcano on it  and its been rumbling  so fasten your geological seatbelts as well as your geographic ones. The Lost City is that kind of movie. But back to those novels: The heavy breathing between their covers cant compare to the heavy breathing inspired by their covers. Thats because the image of Alan Caprison adorns them. He is a male model in full Fabio mode. (Remember him?) Loretta finds Alan annoying. He finds her irresistible, not that she notices. So Alan sets out to find and rescue her. To simplify things, just imagine a mix-and-mismatch version of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone. You get action. You get romance. You get comedy. Sometimes it works  lets say 12 percent of the time  and The Lost City can actually be deft and imaginative. Unfortunately, that leaves 88 percent which doesnt. Sandra Bullock plays Loretta. Plays may not be the right word. Works at? Browbeats? Brittle and flinty, Bullocks performance makes Loretta seem even more maladroit than shes supposed to be. Wheres Amy Adams when you need her? Nicole Kidman? Jessie Buckleys too young for the part, but a comedy role for her is overdue. It doesnt help that Bullock spends most of the movie wearing a glittery magenta jumpsuit with a plunging neckline (dont ask). Youre basically a walking disco ball, Alan points out when she wonders why the bad guys in pursuit keep finding them. It really doesnt help, comparatively speaking, that Alan is played by Channing Tatum. With deadpan glee, he gives himself up to playing a beefcake doofus; and the result is quite enchanting. Alan is a gender-reversal blond bimbo. Hes a sexy dim bulb, only the curves are in different places. Wait, Im the damsel in distress? a perplexed Alan asks the kajillionaire. See, hes not as dumb as he looks. Playing the rich guy, Daniel Radcliffe displays a Rumpelstiltskin energy thats quite winning. If only he could have loaned some to Bullock. Radcliffe has a beard whose bushiness nicely complements those thick eyebrows of his. Its been 11 years since the last Harry Potter movie. Its time for a new franchise. Somebody at Marvel should cast Radcliffe as Wolverine Jr.DaVine Joy Randolph, as Lorettas editor, is overbearing. Her presence does prove crucial to resolving the plot. Thats not the case with Brad Pitt, whos only briefly on hand. But hes such fun in a brief appearance, playing a mercenary brought in by Alan to help spring Loretta, that thats okay. Plus, he gives you a reason to wait through the first minute or two of the credits. I can reveal no more. Lets just say it adds to the 12 percent and leave it at that.",DWM_Doc3_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
73,DWM_Doc4_TheLostCity,"Sandra Bullock recently announced that shed be taking a temporary break from acting, which is a bummer for movie lovers, especially fans of her unique comedic talents. Her knack for comedy is on full display in The Lost City, in which she and Channing Tatum play an opposites-attract-type couple stuck in an improbable jungle adventure worthy of the cheesiest Hollywood blockbusters. The Lost City means to parody those films, and Bullock and Tatums surprising level of chemistry aids tremendously in that quest. But the cardinal sin for any such film is to display the very cliches it mocks or, even worse, to stop being funny. The Lost Citys script eventually falls into both sinkholes and not even its star-studded casts muscular talent can save it from that self-created morass. Bullock stars as Loretta Sage, the disaffected novelist behind a bestselling series of pulpy romances featuring Dash McMahon. Tatum plays Alan, the cover model for Dash  bulging biceps, solid pecs, washboard abs and all. Loretta wishes that her fans cared about the interesting archeological and anthropological bits she peppers her novels with (she was a former explorer herself, in a past life), but the gals (and guys) in her audience swoon over and over again for Dashs debonaire smile, rippling arm flexes and winking, blown kisses. Her publicist, Beth (DaVine Joy Randolph), tries her best to spruce up Lorettas digital age persona, but the deadpan cynicism that Bullock excels at persistently gets in the way. Fed up, Loretta considers putting down her pen or  even worse  killing off Dash, when fate intervenes in the form of Abigail Fairfax, played by an impossibly grown-up Daniel Radcliffe. Abigail is an eccentric billionaire who spots in Lorettas latest book a potential hint to a long-lost treasure on a remote island in the mid-Atlantic. The book is aptly titled The Lost City of D, and query why that part was dropped from the films title. In any event, with Loretta unwitting to help voluntarily, Abigail body snatches her to the island in question so she can help him find the mysterious treasure. Beth and Dash spring to the rescue, with the latter also enlisting the help of Navy Seal-turned-rogue agent Jack Trainer (an incredibly well-cast Brad Pitt). The Lost Citys filmmakers  directors and screenwriters Adam and Aaron Nee (Band of Robbers)  understand that their movies premise is inherently silly and even a bit ridiculous. Thats the whole point, which they gleefully embrace. The character exposition in the first 15 minutes is quick and amusing, permitting Bullock and Tatum to quickly form a tense, playful chemistry through fights and banter whose outcome is all but guaranteed. The next frame, which focuses mostly on Pitts characters efforts to save Loretta while teaching Tatums Dash how to be a suave action hero, is even more metaphysically amusing and entertaining.  But, the film goes off the rails when Pitt makes an abrupt exit and the action focuses almost entirely on Loretta and Dash lost in the jungle, with an ineffective subplot of Beth trying her best to catch up to them spliced in between. At that point, The Lost City mostly runs out of steam, with its best jokes and gags behind it, and with sequences that go on for too long and ultimately stop being entertaining. The scene in the trailer with leeches on Tatums back and Bullock gagging is the most memorable for a solid 75 minutes of the films runtime. The rest crumbles around a bizarre character who Beth encounters in her travels, not to mention several ineffective gags. Loretta and Dashs sequences, meanwhile, switch from the effective back-and-forth that permits both actors to shine, to physical humor surrounding the various henchmen chasing them, and, eventually, the inevitable cliches of the burgeoning romance between them.  Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with silly plotlines, and The Lost City does a much better job than most films within this genre of fully embracing the goofiness of its central conceits and having fun with it. The problem is the filmmakers constant allusions to seriousness while insisting that nothing should be taken seriously. Lorettas repeated references to her life as an archeologist with her dead husband are either totally unnecessary or criminally underbaked  or perhaps both  and jar violently with the films supposed disclaimer of anything other than parody. The same is true for the expected romance between the two lead characters. Here, too, the problem is not the predictability, which the movie embraces and the audience accepts, but rather, the unfortunate distraction that the subplot causes, taking away from the films shinier, funnier moments. Tech-wise, The Lost City also provides little to write home about. This is a mid-budget production that will draw audiences based on its star power alone and the chance for some rollicking entertainment. The most memorable below-the-line element is perhaps the sequin-filled jumpsuit in which Bullock is forced to spend most of the proceedings, courtesy of experienced costume designer Deborah Lynn Scott (Avatar). The accouterments that characterize this onesie create a beacon for Radcliffes henchmen, who are hot on Lorettas trail, and also advance the storyline while adding another layer of levity to the movie. Otherwise, the stunt department does most of the below-the-line heavy lifting. By the time the credits roll, its hard not to feel a wistful nostalgia for this kind of movie, as well as a sense of appreciation for Bullock, who despite the shortcomings of this script, makes The Lost City a sufficiently entertaining movie if you can get past its most tedious moments. One hopes that her acting pause is short-lived and that she, like the character she plays in this film, quickly finds a second wind, because audiences need joy more than ever these days and she knows how to deliver laughs, especially when paired with the right sparring partner.",DWM_Doc4_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
74,DWM_Doc5_TheLostCity,"Once again, a comedy that relies on the gimmick of its premise and the charms of its leads is only worth those two things. With The Lost City, we have a fairly clever (if a tad bit familiar) setup and carrying it as far as they possibly can are a couple of movie stars playing it safely silly. The two stars are Sandra Bullock, playing a writer of romance novels who ends up in a jungle adventure that could have been in one of her books, and Channing Tatum, as an adventurer of sorts. Before you stop because you're sure you've heard this one already, the ""of sorts"" of Tatum's character is that he's the cover model for the adventurer character in the books. In other words, he's not actually a real hero of any kind. Based on the characters' shared lack of experience in matters of survival and treasure hunting, there's a good amount of comedic potential for the mishaps and misadventures of this stumbling, bumbling duo. As has become the trend of modern comedy out of Hollywood, though, the screenwriting quartet responsible for this one only have a few ideas, repeat and spread them out with the distraction of some side players, and hope the actors can charm and improvise their way into making us ignore how slim the material is. Bullock and Tatum are in game enough form here to make us wish we could watch the version of this movie that didn't count on them to carry the whole thing on their shoulders. Bullock plays Loretta, the romance fiction writer, who is still mourning the death of her husband five years prior and hesitant to leave her home. The two were archeologists by trade, and she has taken that career experience and transformed it into the sex-filled adventures of a treasure hunter and her chiseled, gender-studies-degree-possessing hunk of a fellow adventurer. Her latest novel, which was a slog to finish, might very well be her last, too, as she announces to a crowd of fans. They're more interested in seeing Tatum's Alan, a dim-bulb model who has portrayed Loretta's far-more-intelligent man-meat hero Dash on the cover of every one of her books. The author and the model have a falling out at the book event, and immediately after, Loretta is taken away by a couple of goons on orders from Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). As it turns out, the treasure in Loretta's recent book is real, and using the skills of her former career, she accurately translated a dead language in one part of the novel. Anyway, Fairfax abducts the author, flies her to a lost city in the jungle and next to a ready-to-blow volcano, and won't let her go until she translates a parchment that could lead him to the missing treasure. With the help of Loretta's publisher Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), Alan puts together a rescue mission for the woman on whom he's clearly smittenwith a lot of help from a professional mercenary (played by Brad Pitt in a glorified but amusingly straight-faced cameo). The rest of this is fairly predictable (although, while the Pitt character's exit from the story is inevitable, the means of his departure is a bit too realistic for the jokes that result). Loretta and Alan end up in the jungle alone, unprepared (She's in a sequined jumpsuit, and the thoughtful but absentminded Alan brings her fashionable, not practical, boots), constantly messing up the easier way to safety (A car has a lucky, albeit brief, stop right along the edge of a cliff), and pursued by Fairfax and his assortment of henchmen. All the while, Loretta and Alan banter and bicker their way through the tropical forest, up steep hills, down a river (where there's the inescapable gag of Alan being covered in leeches), and slowly but surely into each other's heart. There's not much to these characters, but Bullock, whose character at least has a general idea about surviving in inhospitable places, and Tatum, who's clearly having fun as a wannabe but never-could-be action-movie hero, have a nice-enough sense of chemistry. The screenplay (written by Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, as well as the fraternal directing team of Aaron and Adam Nee) almost seems to have been written with that sense of chemistry in mind, considering that the dynamic of this relationship is one joke (aside from a couple scenes in which Loretta hints at her grief and Alan suggests he cares more about the author's writing than she does), while the familiar travails of the adventure make up the movie's other one. The filmmakers display such little trust in and inspiration for the central plot that a decent portion of the story diverts to Fairfax, his goons, and Beth's attempt to reach her most profitable author. Such distractions are seemingly pointless but transparently necessary in the case of The Lost City. The movie gives us the promises of a somewhat clever idea and some good-humored actors, and then, it simply and unfortunately hopes for the best.",DWM_Doc5_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
75,DWM_Doc6_TheLostCity,"After being taken hostage, a romance-adventure novelist and her cover model team up to find The Lost City in this action-adventure comedy. Big-budget action-adventure romantic comedies feel like a thing of the past. Im so glad that Paramount didnt unload the film because its worth every penny seeing it in a movie theater. I know, I knowCovid is starting to surge again so chances are likely that you might be waiting for VOD. Its perfectly understandable but if you do see it in theaters, its the shared experience is worth it. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a romance-adventure novelist. Her archaeologist husband has been dead for some time but the two shared many adventures. Shes starting to promote her new book with cover model Alan (Channing Tatum), who does his best to actually be Dash. Eccentric billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) asks her for help because Lorettas latest book deals with the treasure he wants. She doesnt have any interest in helping him. The next thing you know she gets kidnapped. She has a smart watch so one way or another, a rescue will take place. Alan brings on Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) for a rescue mission. Alan and Loretta must work together to survive. While all this is happening, the islands volcano is active and could blow at any minute. It takes publishing The Lost City of D to provide Loretta the direction she needs in her life. I mean, she cannot even take Alan seriously until he plays a role in rescuing her. Is this something that happens often to cover models? Maybe but I dont know because thats not an area in which Im familiar. Publisher/marketing guru Beth Hatten (DaVine Joy Randolph) is putting her all into this tour but meeting resistance from Loretta in every step of the process. Beth even brings on a social media manager, Allison (Patti Harrison), to work with Loretta. But anyway, Beth gets quite the arc of her own during the process of rescuing Loretta. A shut-in author and a model are the last people that should be stuck in the jungle. Were talking about an environment that is far from their comfort zone. To think that there was a time when Sandra Bullock didnt want to make the film. Factor in a pandemic and well, this is a film that we need right now. When youre this deep into a pandemic, comedies are an essential genre. They make us laugh and this one in particular offers quite a bit of fun. Who doesnt want to have fun when watching a movie? Let alone the escapism! If you give me a big-budget film that provides escapist entertainment, Im not going to turn it down. Well, unless it involves antisemitic or transphobic bigots. Adam Nee and Aaron Nee come from the world of independent filmmaking. Its not always easy making the jump to studio pictures but having a producer like Sandra Bullock makes the transition easier. Shes the type of producer who gives her all. Both Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have fantastic chemistry together. You can tell theyre also having fun and yet, you cant help but notice the screwball energy going on. Well, when Daniel Radcliffe isnt trying to kill them. Radcliffe is great in the role, too. It shows that hes taking on more adult roles that couldnt be further from that of a wizard. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt has a priceless cameo as ex-Navy SEAL Jack Trainer. If you think Bryce Dallas Howard running in heels in Jurassic World was bad, wait until you see the sparkly jumpsuit that costume designer Marlene Stewart provides for Sandra Bullock. I mean, its like having a flashback to 2015! There are costume designs that can make or break a career but Marlene Stewarts work in The Lost City certainly could be her legacy. It also should be in the award conversation later this year. The Lost City gives us the escapist entertainment we need right now.",DWM_Doc6_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
76,DWM_Doc7_TheLostCity,"Channing Tatum plays himbos like Mozart wrote symphonies. Its a delicate art, and about much more than playing dumb. Its about capturing the sweet, wounded desperation of a man whos aware of the pressure on him to fulfil some kind of masculine ideal, but wouldnt even know where to start. The himbo, Id argue, is an underrated feminist archetype, a positive image of masculinity that simultaneously critiques the kinds of wild expectations we place on men. Its all about subversion  that what hes ultimately valued for arent the superficial markers of dominance or caveman brawn, but the pure goodness of his heart.Tatum has spent his entire career perfecting that kind of himbo, whether it be in the 21 Jump Street or Magic Mike films. And, finally, in The Lost City, hes been paired with his ideal opposite: Sandra Bullock, the actor you call to play very smart women who still cant seem to keep their lives together, who delivers in ways that are relatable as opposed to patronising. Though the film, directed by brothers Adam and Aaron Nee, presents itself as a 21st-century retread of Robert Zemeckiss adventure romcom Romancing the Stone, its really the kind of project thats suctioned itself to its A-list leads like a barnacle on a ship. Bullock is the flinty but loveable Loretta Sage, an archaeologist whos become an emotional shut-in after her husbands untimely death. Shes now slumming it  in her opinion  as the author of a series of steamy romance novels. Tatum is Alan Caprison, the cover model and now public face of Lorettas hunky creation, Dash McMahon. His dedication to the role mildly repulses her. At Lorettas latest book signing, he answers questions like he somehow had a hand in writing her work, before promptly ripping off his shirt. Alan, in a way, has become the physical manifestation of her own self-loathing. It doesnt help that her publicist, Beth (DaVine Joy Randolph), insists that she turns up to the event in a sequinned jumpsuit so tight that it forces her to shuffle around like someone wrapped head-to-toe in medical bandages. Its not the ideal fit for what happens next. Loretta is kidnapped by the unloved son (a very game Daniel Radcliffe) of a media mogul, Abigail Fairfax, whos convinced the tidbits of historical knowledge littered throughout her books make her the key to finding the lost Crown of Fire. The treasure is said to be buried deep beneath a volcanic island out in the Atlantic, somewhere in the ruins of The Lost City of D, which has recently exposed itself to the elements. Well, technically, as Abigail points out, its exposed just the tip. Expect much more innuendo where that came from. The story here leans pretty hard on its dont judge a book by its cover lessons, sometimes in the literal sense  Alan chastises Loretta for dismissing her books as nothing but low-brow shlock. But Bullock and Tatum are such dedicated professionals in the romcom field that it almost feels a little rude not to fall for their eventual romance. Its lovely to watch the way Loretta warms up to Alan once his self-imposed image of masculinity starts to chip away, as she tenderly applies eczema cream to his back while laying out how shed describe the moment in one of her novels. The Lost City, for the most part, finds that sweet spot between goofy and sincere, especially during the scenes where Tatums Alan tries to match up to the mercenary hired to rescue Loretta, played by none other than Brad Pitt. The star flips his long, blonde locks around like hes back in Legends of the Fall, and smoulders with smug self-satisfaction. Tatum, in reaction, flounders magnificently. Unfortunately, the further away from Tatum and Bullock you get, the more the film struggles. The fact that Patti Harrison, as Lorettas social media manager, steals away all of her scenes just by being weird enough to call someones grandmother a slut, highlights how deficient the writing can be in other places. Randolph is stuck playing the Black best friend whose entire existence gravitates around the white protagonist; theres an attempt to poke fun at the adventure genres implicit exoticism that feels awkwardly half-hearted. But if you can force yourself to be myopic enough that nothing outside of its central romance matters? Well, then, The Lost City plays like a dream.",DWM_Doc7_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
77,DWM_Doc8_TheLostCity,"There are few things as uplifting as the embrace of laughter. And one of the loveliest ways to experience that embrace is in the dark surrounded by strangers*, with popcorn in your lap and the warmth of a cinema screen brightening your eyes and mood. It takes an unabashedly funny film to unite a room in laughter, happily The Lost City is just that. Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a solitary soul. Once a globe trotter with a passion for breathing new life into ancient history, Loretta withdrew from the world following the death of her husband and has settled for living vicariously through the antics of her characters. Her hero Dash McMahon makes all her readers swoon but thanks to the dedication of a hunky cover model he has taken on a life of his own. If Loretta is ever to get a life, Dash must die. Dash is everything to Alan (Channing Tatum). Before he donned the flowing locks and disposable shirts demanded of Lorettas leading man he was a nobody, he wont go back to anonymity without a fight. Not an actual punch-up  Alan is a lover, not a fighter  but he is fiercely loyal to the author and the franchise and carefully oblivious to her disdain. Soon it will be time for Alan to step up and prove his mettle, a mercurial billionaire has Loretta in his crosshairs and (to her great irritation) the next chapter could prove deadly. Media dynasty brat Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is basically Roman Roy with a childhood fixation on his Indiana Jones boxset. And now that hes a grown-up, Fairfax wants ALL the treasure. Lorettas meticulous research for her novel took her perilously close to the Crown of Fire  Fairfaxs quarry  and one translation, in particular, makes her an invaluable asset to him. When his ultimate cheese board fails to charm, he simply has his henchmen deliver Loretta to a remote Atlantic Island where he plans to stamp his foot extra hard until she complies. But Fairfaxs cunning plan did not account for Alan! Comparisons to Romancing the Stone are obviously inescapable here and superficially The Lost City shares plenty of common ground with the 80s classic. Yet it is so much more than that; part Nims Island, part The Lego Movie, a bit Dora and the Lost City of Gold and obviously a lot Indy; the real secret to The Lost Citys appeal is the winning charm of its cast. Adam and Aaron Nees action caper might not bring anything revelatory to the table in terms of plot but its a deliciously fluffy comedy confection and the charisma is palpable. Brad Pitt and DaVine Joy Randolph steal every scene theyre in as a CIA operative tasked with recovering Loretta and her dedicated publicist, respectively, Bullock and Tatum have fabulous bickering chemistry and honestly everyone looks like theyre having a ball. Alan lacks the Neeson nouse needed to mount a rescue but he has a huge heart and an indomitable spirit and he knows a man who can; his trainer, Jack Trainer, usefully in Alans phone under Trainer, because he is one. (We hope the Working Girl namecheck is an intentional nod to Harrison Ford.) Wily, knowledgable, certain-set-of-skilled and fit as f*ck, Jack (Brad Pitt) is every word of leading man Loretta ever wrote, made flesh. And Alan comes along for the ride, just in case. Despite gun-toting bad guys, an active volcano, hostile jungle conditions and a very rich manchild who doesnt like to lose, nothing could possibly go wrong now. Sandra Bullock always delivers as a leading lady but with the right co-star to bounce off she sparkles. The odd couple pairing with Tatum allows her to use every weapon in her comedic arsenal from slapstick to sarcasm and Tatum makes an excellent foil  playing against his looks well  he is heartbreaking and hilarious in his bafflement over how ridiculously he is outmatched by Trainer. Full of personality and plenty of twists and turns to keep the predictable action skipping along, The Lost City is daft and delightful in equal measure; the perfect Easter holiday indulgence.",DWM_Doc8_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
78,DWM_Doc9_TheLostCity,"There was a certain flavor of film that we used to see fairly often back in the day, films that were part rom-com, part adventure. These movies brought together action elements with love stories and steeped the whole thing in quippy banter and moments of slapstick. Now, were these movies always good? Of course not. But they were almost always fun  and that was more than enough. We dont see as many of those films these days, what with the industrys pivot to IP blockbusters and franchise development. But when they do turn up, it can be a reminder of how much fun these kinds of movie experiences can be.The Lost City, directed by Aaron and Adam Nee from a screenplay they co-wrote with Dana Fox and Oren Uziel, is a throwback to those delightful mélanges of comedy, adventure and romance. Thanks to some engaging performances, headlined by Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, and a distinctly retro storytelling sensibility, the movie proves to be a lovely romp, a frothy, goofy trifle of a film that refuses to take itself too seriously. Sure, it might not be great cinema, but I definitely had a great time and I bet you will too.Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is stuck. Shes struggling to finish the latest book in her ongoing series, much to the chagrin of her agent Beth (DaVine Joy Randolph), and still dealing with the grief over the passing of her archaeologist husband a few years earlier. Reluctantly, Loretta agrees to appear at a convention for a Q&A, where she discovers that she will be joined by Alan (Channing Tatum), the airheaded beefcake cover model that has represented her hunky hero Dash McMahon since the beginning. Theres conflict between the two, with both sporting significant egos. But theres more than meets the eye when it comes to Loretta Sages books. See, it turns out that she has long been incorporating aspects of the archaeological work she did with her husband into her books. And this newest one  The Lost City of D  is no exception. However, this time, someone noticed. Someone who views this as a unique opportunity. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the son of a billionaire business mogul, obsessed with possessing the unpossessable. He believes that the Lost City of D is real, and that Loretta is the key to translating a pictographic language that will lead him to a lost tomb and a fabled treasure. And so, he does what weird rich guys do in these sorts of movies  he kidnaps her and whisks her away to a small island where, as it turns out, he has been excavating the very real lost city. And Alan sees her get taken. Being generally clueless, hes at a loss for what to do. However, he is able to enlist the help of a Navy SEAL-turned-meditation trainer that he knows, a guy named Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt). Alan heads to the island to meet up with Trainer, only to insist that he be allowed to participate. Against his better judgment, Trainer allows Alan to come along. The rescue effort soon goes sideways, however, with circumstances leaving the equally-inept Alan and Loretta to make their way through the jungle on their own, all with Fairfax and his forces in pursuit. And as they do their best to stay safe and stay alive, the mismatched pair learns that they have more in common than they might have guessed, even as they embark on a real-life adventure far more exciting than anything Loretta could ever have written.The Lost City is reminiscent of 80s-era adventure films like Romancing the Stone, fun and irreverent love stories set in exotic locales and driven by grand adventure. This isnt a film that intends to challenge; its sole aim is to entertain  an aim that it achieves with a breezy ease. The Nees arent reinventing the wheel here  they are capable, competent filmmakers who clearly have real affection for telling this type of story, so they just  do that. Theres very little fuss or muss at play here  everyone involved seems pretty clear on what kind of film that theyre making and, not for nothing, they all seem to be having a damned good time making it. The key to a film like this ones relative success is how well the various elements are welded together. You need to have solid action-oriented set pieces and workable romantic chemistry and a collection of decent jokes. If you dont have all three, it probably isnt going to click. The Lost City clicks. Filming on location is important with this kind of movie. You dont want to see people wandering around what is clearly a soundstage on a back lot somewhere. The Lost City is clearly happening in a real place  in this case, the Dominican Republic  which lends the proceedings a verisimilitude that contributes mightily. This helps the assorted action sequences  mostly well-executed chases, but a couple of surprising alternatives as well  stand out. And when youve got a central pairing like Bullock and Tatum, well  youre in good shape. Bullock is still throwing rom-com heat; shes prickly and self-conscious and awkward in all the best ways. Tatum  whose comedic talents are generally underrated  gives us a heart-of-gold himbo and just radiates charm. The two of them together are a delight, with bouncy banter and crackling energy  they generate more than enough to power this film. Meanwhile, Radcliffe is having a ball, making a meal out of every scene and generally embodying the just-inept-enough bad guy that a film like this needs. Oh, and Brad Pitt is a hoot  dude clearly understood the assignment. The Lost City is a reminder of Hollywood offerings past, a throwback movie experience that, while slight, is a heck of a lot of fun. At the risk of sounding curmudgeonly, they dont often make em like this anymore. One might even call it  a lost art. (For the record, The Lost City is better  MUCH better  than that joke.)",DWM_Doc9_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
79,DWM_Doc10_TheLostCity,"The Lost City is exactly what it says on the tin, and we appreciate its honesty. This movie isn't going to change anyone's life, but it's a good time at the movies, and there is some hidden depth there in the latter half for people looking for the emotional connection between the artist and their art. A reclusive romance novelist on a book tour with her cover model gets swept up in a kidnapping attempt that lands them both in a cutthroat jungle adventure. The Lost City is exactly the kind of movie that would have cleaned up at the box office before the pandemic, and going into its late March opening weekend; it's going to be interesting to see if the audience for this sort of popcorn movie is still there. There really isn't anything here that is trying to change the world, and there isn't anything about The Lost City that will make it a classic for decades to come. It'll have a reoccurring spot on network television and on streaming services, and it'll be one of those movies that someone can put on, and it won't offend anyone. If you have a group of people around you, no one will dislike it, no one is going to find anything offensive about it, and if you're channel surfing and you see it on, you'll likely stop to watch it. These types of movies used to do extremely well, but in a COVID-19 world and with people not entirely comfortable returning to theaters, are beautiful movie stars doing funny things enough to return to theaters? We'll have to see; the numbers at the time of writing are looking pretty good so far. As for the movie itself, the bare bones of The Lost City are taking all of the classic romance tropes that we've seen in books and films and turning them up to eleven, so we can take a comedic look at them. This is made even more self-aware by the fact that our heroine is an author of the exact genre of book that we are seeing play out on-screen, thus calling attention to all of the tropes happening in front of them and how things like wandering into the jungle is probably not the best idea when it comes to survival. When you have two stars like Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, both of whom have fantastic comedic timing, making these jokes and calling attention to these tropes, you can't help but get swept away by the silly little adventure that these people are on. It's a little inconsequential on the surface, and for many people, that surface reading will be more than enough, and the movie is very honest about what it is and what it intends to be right out of the gate, which is nice. However, there is a bit more there if you're willing to look and even more so if you are a creative of any kind. Bullock is Loretta, an author who lost her husband and thus, lost her love for the genre that made her famous. The main character of her book was almost modeled on an idealized version of what her own life was like with her husband before she decided to write fiction and before he passed away. The city in question is one that Loretta and her husband spent time trying to find together. There is a disconnect between the author and her creation because she lost that connection. She has become disillusioned with not only the writing process but with her books as a whole. She doesn't see them as having any meaning; she doesn't see them as something to be proud of; she is an author ashamed of her own creation. Loretta's journey during The Lost City isn't just about finding a lost city or a lost treasure but reconnecting with that inner voice and passion that so many artists speak of. She is reminded that as much as she might look down on her work, it means a lot to other people, and she needs to remember that others have found meaning in something that she sees as meaningless. Alan (Tatum), her cover model who has nearly taken on the identity of the character of Dash from the books in real life, found meaning in being a version of a real-life Dash for fans. It was the romance novel version of the people who get emotional at comic-cons because they see actors that mean a lot to them acting very in character. That sort of transcendent fandom love that we don't need outside of the narrow scope of, well, sites like Bleeding Cool.  But The Lost City presents an option that could easily happen at a romance novel event. Loretta is also letting go of her husband and realizing that mourning in the way that she was, isolating herself from the world and everyone around her that cared, was prolonging the entire progress. While the events of The Lost City are jarring and ridiculous even by romance novel expectations, it's the jolt that Loretta needs to realize that she wasn't living before. She was surviving, and no loved one wants that for the people that they have to leave behind when they pass. There just happen to be explosions and leaches on Channing Tatum's perfect ass. Brad Pitt is doing a bit that if it doesn't make you excited for Bullet Train later this year, nothing will. Still, it is the thing that forces this character back to reality in a way that could ring true for many people who are merely surviving their life after loss and not living it. All of this makes The Lost City sound very heavy, and some moments are a real kick in the gut, but, in general, this is a brisk little movie where all of the aforementioned subtexts are there if you want and can be mostly bypassed if it isn't your thing. Daniel Radcliffe is on hand playing the kind of over-the-top insane villain that this genre is known for, and the unsung hero of the entire movie is Da'Vine Joy Randolph as Loretta's agent Beth who steals every single scene that she is in. The first half is a little rocky, but the latter half more than makes up for it, and this is a fun little time at the movies. The Lost City is a good time at the movies that will likely see constant replays at parties as background noise.",DWM_Doc10_TheLostCity,DWM,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
150,JLV_Doc1_Batman," When Warner Brothers announced that they were going to make a ""Batman"" movie modeled after the Dark Knight series of the comic, the fan boys roared with approval. Then they announced that Michael Keaton would be Bruce Wayne, and Tim Burton, who only had two movie credits to his name at the time (""Pee Wee's Big Adventure,"" ""Beetlejuice"") would direct. The Comic Book Guys were appalled. Advance buzz was troublesome, with other studios wondering if Warners was about to make ""Superman 5.""

Warner Brothers, meanwhile, breathed comfortably. In fact, they didn't even bother to screen the movie. They knew they were sitting on a gold mine. ""Batman"" completely rewrote the rules for how summer blockbusters were made, how they were promoted, and how they were expected to perform. Its $42 million opening weekend was staggering for the time, easily making back its $30 million budget. Keaton turned out to be an excellent choice for Bruce Wayne, making him guarded but vulnerable. Burton, who was only 30 at the time, showed remarkable vision as well as restraint, treating the source material with the respect it deserved. And then there's Jack Nicholson, whose portrayal of the Joker is the most nuanced performance, from a villain or hero, that you'll ever find in a comic book adaptation.

Set in the ageless, timeless, Gotham City, the police are hearing stories about a vigilante crime fighter who's cleaning up the town on his own. Investigative reporter Knox (Robert Wuhl) is on the trail, but gets sidetracked by photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), who's come to get some pictures of this mysterious ""Bat Man."" Vale soon meets cute with Bruce Wayne (Keaton) at a benefit, completely unaware of his alter ego. But Wayne has bigger problems. Jack Napier (Nicholson), a loose cannon henchman of local crime boss Grissom (Jack Palance), has plans to take over the business, and after a horrific accident at a chemical plant leaves him disfigured, Napier, who's christened himself the Joker, steps up the offensive, on both the city and Batman.


To call ""Batman"" an action movie is misleading. In fact, it's more like a very colorful crime thriller, with a twisted character study at its core. The scene at the museum, set to Prince's excellent ""Partyman,"" (they were actually listening to ""1999"" when they shot the scene) may be raucous, but it's really a big, loud setup to a quiet conversation between the Joker and Vale. In fact, the quietest lines are the most memorable (""Where does he get those wonderful toys?"" and ""Never rub another man's rhubarb,"" to name but a couple). You get the sense that the Joker is trying his damndest to maintain his sanity, but is slowly unwinding before your eyes. That Nicholson could make this homicidal maniac so sympathetic is a testament to his performance.

If there's anything that's off in ""Batman,"" it's Basinger's Vicki Vale character. She seems to serve little purpose outside of the damsel in distress (and she's in constant distress). Wuhl may have been upset that Knox didn't come back for ""Batman Returns,"" but there was really no place or need for him. Billy Dee Williams played Harvey Dent with the goal of becoming Two-Face later, so one wonders how upset he was when the studio bought out his contract and offered the role to Tommy Lee Jones for ""Batman Forever.""",JLV_Doc1_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman
151,JLV_Doc2_Batman,"IÕve watched few movies more than Batman to the point that I can almost recite the script line by line so to say I kinda like it would be a serious understatement, but thatÕs for a pretty good reason.
From the directing, action, performances, music and dazzling set design, there simply isnÕt much this film gets wrong with this timeless take on the Caped Crusader.
Christopher NolanÕs The Dark Knight is the superior movie, but Tim Burton creates a film more faithful to the larger than life, colorful comic book world that is the characterÕs inspiration.
As Gotham City officials prepare to celebrate the 200th anniversary, thereÕs mounting pressure to take down the major crime lord, Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). District Attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) promises to bring him to justice with the aid of Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle), but to do that theyÕd have to stop GrissomÕs top thug, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson).
The police are getting some unwanted help from the masked vigilante Batman (Michael Keaton), attracting the interest of reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger).
BatmanÕs first meeting with Napier results in the criminal getting physically disfigured and mentally unhinged. Adopting a new moniker Ñ The Joker Ñ Napier now wants to taint all of Gotham just like himself and itÕs up to Batman to stop him before all of Gotham is lost.
Screenwriters Sam Hamm (Beetlejuice) and Warren Skaaren (who died a year later from cancer) donÕt get enough credit for their fantastic script. Aside from the memorable and highly quotable dialogue, they arrange the story smartly. We donÕt have to wait an hour before our first Batman sighting, actually seeing him thrashing some crooks before heÕs entertaining GothamÕs finest as Bruce Wayne.
I hadnÕt approached card-carrying geek/undiscovered casting agent status yet and I liked Keaton in Mr. Mom and Beetlejuice, but in that magical time before blogs and Internet memes, comic fans voiced their outrage over the casting the old fashioned way and sent 50,000 protest letters to Warner Bros. Clearly that was a more civilized and reasonable time.
How much different would the movie landscape had been if Burton cast his soon to be frequent collaborator Johnny Depp? Would Depp have made the role as hard to replace as Robert Downey Jr.Õs Iron Man is now? Ironically, Downey was among those considered for the role of Batman.
KeatonÕs no slouch though. He may not look the part, but he gets the character down to the point youÕre not questioning if the role is beyond him. Keaton is simply Bruce Wayne/Batman and his chemistry with Basinger feels as natural as his banter with Michael Gough, who plays WayneÕs faithful butler, Alfred. Wisely, Hamm and Skaaren donÕt go out of their way to work in comedy scenes for Keaton and instead allow him to show his more reserved side without the wacky antics.
Still, the filmÕs spotlight is squarely focused on Nicholson, who provides one of the more indomitable comic book movie performances ever as Joker. Nicholson is magnetic and makes Joker an unpredictable, captivating figure beyond the white skin, green hair, permanently affixed grin and purple ensemble. If the film has a weak spot, itÕs that Joker gets most of the best scenes and moments while Batman is relegated to popping up for the occasional thrilling cameo.
The supporting cast is solid top to bottom with Basinger given enough depth to be more than a standard damsel in distress, Wuhl providing just the right amount of comic relief and Gough as the listening ear/adviser for Wayne.
The film sports a very distinctive, comic book look. The only issue is BatmanÕs costume limits Keaton from turning his head without moving his shoulders. Anton Furst and Peter YoungÕs designs for Gotham City capture the magnificence of this mythical comic book version of New York City with towering skyscrapers and cathedral-like structures in a way to make Gotham a character in itself. The duo earned a well deserved 1990 Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Direction.
Batman easily boasts the best soundtrack of any comic book movie thanks to the combination of Danny ElfmanÕs ominous score and PrinceÕs songs.
And Burton weaves in Òthose wonderful toysÓ specifically the Batmobile and Batwing without making their inclusion feel gimmicky.
Batman was the first comic book movie summer blockbuster event that had us eagerly counting down the days until it came to theaters thanks to a highly successful advertising campaign that made it the one must-see movie of 1989.
Despite the anticipation, the film actually exceeded its hype and seemed to signal the dawn of a new comic book movie age after Superman IV: The Quest for Peace killed off the box office appeal for the only other superhero who could drive audiences to theaters.
It would take another 13 years for the genre to become a permanent and highly profitable fixture in Hollywood, but ÒBatmanÓ hinted at the true mainstream appeal of comic book movies  in captivating the imagination of audiences young and old with an early high point for the developing genre. Highly recommended even for fans who think Batman begins and ends with NolanÕs trilogy.",JLV_Doc2_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman
152,JLV_Doc3_Batman,"Created 50 years ago as a comic book hero, the character of Batman has provided the basis for numerous television and film projects as well. Through the years he has evolved into a cartoon, especially in the high camp TV series of the 1960s. The dark side of the character has now been restored in the new Warner Bros. film Batman.
Produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, this Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset.
The screenplay by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren (story by Hamm), based on characters created by Bob Kane for DC Comics, presents Batman as a menacing, mysterious figure and not as a hero of the people, in spite of the fact that his actions are against Gotham CityÕs criminal elements. City officials, however, are not sure of his motives and disapprove of his vigilante approach to crime fighting. The script also explores the motivation behind the character and the psychological torment of Bruce Wayne and why he has taken on the disguise.
The major strength of the film is actually its surrealistic visual style, which creates a disturbing portrait of a decaying society without structure or purpose. Production designer Anton Furst has created a Gotham City that is a dark, steaming cesspool, littered with waste and evolved as a jumble of almost every architectural style since the beginning of civilization. It is a place where it is most believable that a menace such as The Joker could seduce and possibly control the city.
Contrasting this majestic visual concept is a quiet, but equally intense, human drama in which two people are trying to get together and make it in a basically hostile world.
This is the uniqueness and very soul of the film and it is achieved through the beautifully defined and probing performances of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, a news photographer who is intrigued by both Wayne and Batman. Keaton delivers an especially impressive and deeply nuanced characterization as Wayne. When he takes on the Batman disguise, he becomes an enigmatic, robot-like figured without human personality.
At the other end of the spectrum is Jack NicholsonÕs portrayal of the Joker. It is difficult to imagine any other actor performing this character as well. And Nicholson, in white makeup with his face frozen into a menacing grimace, plays it to the hilt. The actor goes over the edge as only he can do and his performance works perfectly. Jack Palance is fun in his brief appearance as a crime czar and Michael Gough is excellent as WayneÕs fatherly butler. Other performances Ñ including Robert Wuhl as a reporter and Pat Hingle and Billy Dee Williams as city officials Ñ are effective, although basically overshadowed by the production itself. New York Mayor Ed Koch has an amusing unbilled role as the mayor of Gotham City.
Adding emphasis to the action and the grandiose style is Danny ElfmanÕs pulsating and driving musical score, while several songs by Prince contribute often amusing punctuation.",JLV_Doc3_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman
153,JLV_Doc4_Batman,"Occasionally laughable but mostly tinged with a morbid darkness as only Tim Burton can supply, 1989Õs ÒBatmanÓ is a groundbreaking comic book adaptation. While the later films steadily got so hokey that the franchise required complete redefining (starting with ÒBatman BeginsÓ in 2005 by director Christopher Nolan), this original theatrical venture retains most of the appeal of the inimitable hero and a standout performance by Jack Nicholson, who some say canÕt be bested as the most famous Batman villain, The Joker. ItÕs certainly more cinematic than the Adam West interpretations.
An uncanny, black-cloaked flying man intercepts criminals during their getaways Ð a seemingly righteous act Ð but is being stalked by the local press of Gotham City, intent on revealing the identity of the ÒBatman.Ó On the job is award-winning photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and comic relief reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl), who attempt to get closer to the mystery by investigating wealthy recluse Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). Just as soon as their investigation is underway, criminal Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) is set up by his double-crossing boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) and is caught in a deadly crossfire with a crooked cop and the avenging Batman.
Thrown into a vat of chemical waste, Napier emerges a changed man Ð one with a newfound penchant for terror and a maniacally wicked laugh. Dubbed the ÒJoker,Ó he contaminates household supplies with toxic chemicals and plans to overtake Gotham City with chaos Ð and his unruly gang of mime gangsters. But Batman stands firmly in the way of such dastardly evildoers, and an explosive showdown on the blackened streets of the panic-ridden city becomes inevitable.
Batman the ÒDark KnightÓ is brought to vivid life, despite a curious lack of backstory. While many initial entries of potential series define the origins of the character, Tim BurtonÕs attempt at the live-action superhero assumes that the audience already knows something about the caped crusader. An iconic figure with a huge fan base, this rushed plunge into the alien world of Gotham City may be too much for those not familiar with the renowned comic book series. Nevertheless, vigilantism in an unruly town is nothing new for action fans and always a solid source of excitement.
Beautifully macabre set designs help bring out Gotham CityÕs appeal, along with the colorful array of illicit characters. Dark and foreboding, the locales house the likes of the Joker, adorned with brightly colored suits and creepily gaudy makeup, and his band of clown-like pantomimists, who tote machineguns and lay waste to crowds of civilians. The JokerÕs vivid makeup mirrors the artwork from the graphic novels, but utilizes scar tissue structuring that borders on nonsensical.
Some of the gangsterÕs stunts are a little overboard on comedy, especially when the Joker has a henchman carry around a jukebox so that he has an ever-present theme song following him about. The pulsing soundtrack by Prince also doesnÕt help the severer tone Tim Burton orchestrated for his ghoulish production, though the museum destruction montage could be considered fittingly off-putting (the murderer dubs himself a homicidal artist). The majority of the film has the appropriately dark touch expected from the awe-inspiring Batman, but enough goofy scenes permeate the atmosphere that they ultimately counter the seriousness.
Decent scenes of action, including chases in the Batmobile and Batplane help to enliven the dull spots, and itÕs always a thrill to see Batman make use of his many high-tech gadgets to thwart enemies. With an exciting showdown in a towering, rickety cathedral, intriguing characters, inventive art direction (which earned it an Academy Award), and the superb Jack Nicholson, ÒBatmanÓ set the groundwork for one of the most successful franchises in motion picture history. The following three movies suffered a similarly lucrative yet much less acclaimed fate.",JLV_Doc4_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman
154,JLV_Doc5_Batman,"The theatrical release of Batman celebrates 30 years this year and holds up for being the product of its era with regards to cinematic entertainment.
A brief prologue introduces us to the Wayne family before cutting to present day.  Gotham City mayor Borg (Lee Wallace) wants the city to be safer. This task falls upon both District Attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) and Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (Pat Hingle).  Unbeknownst to them, Gotham has a new vigilante parading around town in the form of Batman (Bruce Wayne).  Amid rumors of this Dark Knight, photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) start to investigate his existence.
Corrupt police officers working with the mob bring the rise of Jack Napier aka Joker (Jack Nicholson).  In what will be a running theme for so many of these Batman villains, Napier falls into chemicals and goes mad.  Ever the playmate, Bruce starts a relationship with Vicki but the whole work thing always manages to get in the way.  I wonÕt really spoil you with the rest because itÕs been 30 years.
Once upon a time, this would be the best film depicting the Dark Knight.  This is no longer the case after Christopher NolanÕs phenomenal trilogy.  ItÕs funny how this film was coming along as the Superman franchise was shooting itself in the leg.  The release of Batman would come two years after Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.  History would only repeat itself a decade later with the release of Batman and Robin.  IÕm kind of partial to that film for reasons that IÕll discuss in my review of the film.
As a director, Tim Burton has a way with directing style on screen.  Bruce WayneÕs alter ego is a darker character than Superman.  Appropriately, it means a darker film.  Superman, this is not.  All apologies to those who grew up watching Adam West but Batman is not meant to be campy.  What this film does is return the dark roots back to Batman.  ItÕs what Bob Kane and Bill Finger probably imagined when they were creating the character back in the day.  We have producer Michael E. Uslan to thank for this even if the film took a while to get into production.
When it comes to the filmÕs casting, Jack Nicholson is the bigger star.  Coming off of Beetlejuice means that Tim Burton and Michael Keaton already have a relationship.  Casting an unknown actor is risky but it can pay off.  Look at Christopher Reeves!  By choosing Michael Keaton, it would kick off a casting controversy.  Sound familiar?  We are seeing the exact same today with Robert Pattinson being cast in Matt ReevesÕ The Batman.  IÕm just saying:  give people the chance!  There is nothing wrong with Michael KeatonÕs performance.
Where Christopher Nolan would build towards the Joker, Sam Hamm and Warren SkarenÕs screenplay opts to make him the first villain.  ItÕs unwise to compare Jack NicholsonÕs take to that of Heath Ledger but itÕs fair to say that Heath absolutely owns the role.  I hate to say it but NicholsonÕs take almost seems tame by comparison.
When we talk about the great theme songs, Danny ElfmanÕs theme song for the film must be somewhere on the list.  ItÕs become so iconic that one cannot think of the character without thinking of the tune.  Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard would certainly make the score their own in the Christopher Nolan trilogy.
Batman doesnÕt only return the character to his roots but would set a benchmark for comic book movies at the time.",JLV_Doc5_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman
155,JLV_Doc6_Batman,"As its trailer has already hinted, ÒBatmanÓ (citywide) is very much a movie and a hero for the Ô80s. Is it interesting? Fitfully. Is it fun? Not much, Gotham City fans, not much.
ItÕs a murky, brooding piece, set in a twisted city almost choked with evil and inertia, and Bruce Wayne, half of its heroÕs dual identities, is very nearly in the same fix. Driven to right a naughty world the best that one man can, heÕs withdrawn, cerebral, severely absent-minded. As director Tim Burton sees him, heÕs practically the Hamlet of millionaire philanthropist socialites.
When he puts on his Batmuscles and his Bathat, his Batjock, his Batgauntlets and his world heavyweightÕs Batbelt, almost nothing is left of him but glitteringly blue-gray eyes and a voluptuously full mouth. If a costume alone could stop crime, this one would, since it almost stops Michael Keaton.
In the opposite corner, wearing purple satin, clown white, green hair and a permanent rictus, is the pictureÕs big noise, the Joker, the dirtiest trickster since G. Gordon Liddy. Never still for a millisecond, Jack NicholsonÕs Joker preens and prances, drum major for a squad of sociopaths, detonating his noxious jokes like cherry bombs. (ÒYouÕre insane!Ó Joker: ÒI thought I was a Pisces.Ó)
Director Burton has sensibly turned his back on the camp of the Ô60s ÒBatmanÓ TV series, and has drawn his menacing atmosphere from the Gotham City of ÒBatmanÕsÓ creator, Bob Kane. Burton read his audience right in that respect. And with the production designs of Anton Furst (ÒThe Company of Wolves,Ó ÒFull Metal JacketÓ) and Danny ElfmanÕs darkly enveloping score, he has a shiveringly dense and poetic city against which to set his characters.
Unfortunately, the screenplay, credited to both Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren from HammÕs story and KaneÕs characters, doesnÕt give those characters a fighting chance. It flops about, unsure of which of its scarred protagonists it finds the most seductive, and itÕs disastrously low on the sort of wit that can make a gargantuan movie lovable.
The movieÕs first half hour is a thicket of exposition, yet it never answers a few basic Batquestions in every mind. The Joker we learn almost everything about: his plans to take over first the girlfriend (Jerry Hall), then the chair of crime lord Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Batman, his savvy butler Alfred (the estimable Michael Gough) and the Batgadgets remain annoyingly uninvestigated. So does the moment when Kim BasingerÕs Vicki Vale notices itÕs Bruce Wayne fiddling away in that Batcave.
So Bruce Wayne was traumatized by witnessing the murder of his parents when he was 9, and that has led him into this double life of midnight vigilantism. Why bats? Wherefore bat caves? The fact that heÕs mortal makes him especially fascinating, yet the movie (and that Batrig) never lets us worry for a second that anything can happen to him.
The volatile Keaton, an extremely interesting casting choice if he had a chance to let some of his dangerousness out, remains tamped-down and muted. His Bruce Wayne is as magnetic as one can make a character carved out of soap, but itÕs hardly KeatonÕs fault. As Òace photographer Vicki Vale,Ó Basinger again does her magic of making a stock character warm, interesting and irreplaceable through some mysterious chemistry all her own. Meanwhile, Nicholson (quoted this week as saying, ÒI wanted to see how far I could go and IÕve never hit my head on topÓ) has corkscrewed through the roof and is reaching into the ozone.
The Joker begins as Gotham City gangster Jack Napier before a confrontation with Batman tips him into a vat of toxic waste, turning him into a party-hearty misanthrope. His notion is to paralyze Gothamites with Smylex gas and lethal toiletries. His target? Apparently anything that moves, including his own henchmen, and a few things that donÕt, like a museumÕs worth of the art treasures of the Western world, which go under in an orgy of slashing and splashing. He does spare one: a shrieking nightmare vision by contemporary Angst -master Francis Bacon that the Joker kinda likes.
The vandalism is supposed to suggest the lengths to which this sadist will go. There may even be a lost Ted Turner-colorizing joke somewhere in the melee. But not even the fact that the paintings look like K mart repros can keep this sequence from being a true stomach churner. Not in todayÕs world of indiscriminate art whackos.
NicholsonÕs Joker will be the pivotal point for many. ItÕs his energy, spurting like an artery, that keeps the picture alive; itÕs certainly not the special effects, the editing, which has no discernible rhythm, or the flaccid screenplay. Nicholson keeps things moving higher and higher, even with his reading of the line, ÒItÕs time to retire,Ó throwing in a voice thatÕs pure John Huston.
But itÕs also a performance of such draining intensity and so few really quotable lines, most of which have been packed into the trailer, that it has us on the ropes begging for mercy long before the Joker waltzes into his climax. To a die-hard Nicholson fan, itÕs unthinkable that a day would come when you wished Jack Nicholson would get off the screen, just so this headache would let up for a minute. But ÒBatmanÓ has managed it. Talk about a toxic waste. . . .
(The Joker, with his gruesome death dealing, is also the cautionary figure for parents of young children. Take that PG-13 very seriously; this is where bad dreams are born.)
The JokerÕs screaming machinations become so exhausting that to get away from them, we begin looking past him, straight into some puzzling inconsistencies. The gag of the TV anchorpersons, getting progressively scuzzy because theyÕre afraid of sampling the JokerÕs line of killer-toiletries, is a funny one. Then why donÕt we see dapper Dans like Dist. Atty. Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams, thrown away in a sub-cameo) also getting frayed in the personal daintiness department? Does he have his own line of after shave?
When, in a riotous parade through GothamÕs scrunched-up streets, the Joker kills about a quarter of the revelers with poison gas, why donÕt the other hundreds swarm over him and beat that silly grin off his face? And in the bell tower ÒVertigoÓ finale, after the three principals have inched their way perilously to the top, where in the name of holy Bat guano did those Joker henchmen come from?
Sidestepped most disastrously is the meaning of the conflict between Batman and the Joker. Batman is hardly Superman, unscarred psychically, and his duel with a man who could have been another facet of his own personality should have resonated. Instead, the Joker has been demoted into a broad-scale sociopath, without a tempterÕs power or a mythic villainÕs complexity. And thatÕs the movieÕs real undoing.",JLV_Doc6_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman
156,JLV_Doc7_Batman,"Critics adored Batman for its eccentric, Burtonesque take on a pop-culture icon, for its moody, noirish gothic art-deco Gotham City, and of course for NicholsonÕs showy performance. Comic-book fans, meanwhile, appreciated the film for rescuing the Dark Knight from the over-the-top camp comedy of the 1960s series and making him suitably dark and brooding.
For all that, though, the filmÕs flaws are hard to overlook. The story is a mess. To start with, the love affair of Bruce Wayne (Keaton) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) has no substance or emotional resonance. Bruce and faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) are constantly reminding one another how ÒspecialÓ Vicki supposedly is, though sheÕs done little to show it, unless you count sleeping with Bruce after their awkward first date. (Peter Parker and Mary JaneÕs romance in the original Spider-Man is also shallow, but at least MJ is sweet and Peter is credibly smitten. Bruce and Vicki have no chemistry as well as no relationship.)
Scenes and lines of dialogue make no sense. Take the bit where Bruce Wayne, protected only by a small metal tray under his shirt, gets jiggy with the gun-wielding Joker when the latter bursts in on VickiÕs apartment. Forget the absurdity of relying on a book-sized tray as a bulletproof vest Ñ whatÕs the point of BruceÕs actions? WhatÕs he trying to accomplish?
WhatÕs the point of the JokerÕs ÒWho do you trust?Ó PR campaign against Batman, as if the two of them were running for mayor? This theme makes sense when it recurs in the Burton-directed sequel, Batman Returns, where the Penguin (Danny DeVito) really is running for mayor, but in the original it feels like a private issue of BurtonÕs thatÕs been imposed on the story for no reason. (That the Joker is crazy is not a sufficient explanation. As depicted in this film, the Joker is an ÒartistÓ; he may be bizarre and sociopathic, but his actions are never simply irrational or pointless.)
Then there are sloppy little things. When Bruce asks Vicki on their first date whether she had Òany trouble finding the place,Ó itÕs meant to be funny because Wayne Manor is presumably a major Gotham landmark Ñ but the movie seems to have forgotten that Vicki was just at his place for the big cocktail party. Then thereÕs the bit in the newsroom with Vicki and reporter Knox (Robert Wuhl) musing about who Bruce Wayne really is, how thereÕs Ònothing in his fileÉ no photos, no history, nothing.Ó Hello? Nothing on Bruce Wayne, millionaire playboy? ThatÕs like saying they have nothing on Donald Trump or Paris Hilton.
Then thereÕs the depiction of Batman himself, starting with the casting of Keaton, hardly anyoneÕs idea of an action hero. Years later, when the director was briefly attached to the long-delayed Superman movie project now in development by Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2), Burton made an even odder casting call, tapping Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel. Such eccentric choices seem to bespeak not just creative quirkiness, but a deliberately subversive sensibility regarding these pop-culture icons of square-jawed, broad-shouldered heroism. In a word, Burton seems to get a kick out of undermining the traditional hero archetype.
An even bigger problem, perhaps, is that Keaton makes hardly any impression in the role, in or out of the mask. Keaton lets his arched eyebrows act for him, and while it may be said that they give a great performance, thereÕs only so much an eyebrow can do.
As Bruce Wayne, rather than coming off either intense and driven or charming and frivolous, Keaton seems merely distracted, socially stiff and awkward. As Batman, he seems Ñ no, he is stiff and awkward, literally Ñ less a lithe super hero than a toy action figure with a limited range of motion. When Batman clobbers bad guys in one swift move, itÕs not because heÕs just that bad, itÕs because he canÕt do two moves. The effect is never more ridiculous than when he has to look around; since he canÕt turn his neck, heÕs left swiveling his whole body, or leaning back to look up. Yeah, thatÕs going to strike fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere.
Who is Batman, anyway? In the opening sequence, we see a couple with a young boy wandering lost in GothamÕs mean streets, stumbling at last into a dangerous alley where a couple of thugs rob them at gunpoint. The resonances between this incident and the seminal event in young Bruce WayneÕs life, emphasized later in the film by a flashback to the murder of Dr. and Mrs. Wayne, are too striking to be ignored. Yet when Batman shows up, what does he do? Kicks one of the thugs through a door and menaces the other one a bit, telling him to warn his criminal friends about their new enemy. Does he recover the stolen property and return it to its owners? Does he see to their safety in any way? Is this helpless family any better off than the Waynes were when there was no Batman looking over Gotham? If the movie doesnÕt care, why should we?
Still more troubling is this Dark KnightÕs willingness to kill, as when Batman sends the Batmobile into the factory manufacturing the JokerÕs killer cosmetics line to firebomb the place, giving the thugs inside no opportunity to escape. In the climax, Batman tries to kill the Joker, then finally does kill him.
Finally, thereÕs NicholsonÕs celebrated performance as the Joker. Critics of the film have observed archly that it ought to have been called Joker rather than Batman; and certainly Nicholson, also giving a great eyebrow performance while otherwise doing what he can with his cheeks wired back in a perpetual grimace, blows Keaton off the screen.
But even NicholsonÕs performance doesnÕt really work, at least not until the final act. ItÕs a fine Jack Nicholson performance, commanding and dangerous, but even granting the legitimacy of different takes on a fictional character, for the most part Nicholson doesnÕt seem to understand the Joker any more than Keaton understands Batman.
The Joker, whoever he may be, isnÕt surly and quietly menacing like this fellow. HeÕs more manic and wild-eyed, and while (depending on the depiction) he may or may not be actually be funny, certainly he thinks everything is a riot, whereas NicholsonÕs Joker doesnÕt really seem to have much of a funnybone. Only in the climax, in a cathedral belfry showdown reminiscent of the climax of Metropolis, does Nicholson seem finally to grow into the character Ñ just in time for him to be killed off.
ItÕs not a complete waste of time. Burton does pull off some striking images, such as the closeups of Batman donning his battle gear, and the closing shot of Batman silhouetted against the Gotham skyline with the Bat-signal in the distance. And Gotham itself, all seamy, steamy alleys and decrepit concrete canyons, is a triumph of art direction. But when the Joker shoots down the Batplane with an unimpressive-looking handgun with a telescoping barrel, or when some anonymous thug kicks Batman around for several minutes in the cathedral climax, itÕs hard not to be frustrated with the film.
BatmanÕs best conceit is the notion that the Joker, the arch-enemy that Batman helped to create, also happens to be the thug who murdered BruceÕs parents, thus helping to create Batman. While some may object to this massive coincidence, it has undeniable poetic appeal, and works in a fairy-tale sort of way.
Even so, IÕm glad that Christopher Nolan chose to ignore Batman and its sequels in Batman Begins, a film that at last ÒgetsÓ the soul of the Dark Knight. Indeed, thereÕs a real sense in which Batman truly does begin with NolanÕs film, and that it is not merely the best Batman film to date, but the only one.",JLV_Doc7_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman
157,JLV_Doc8_Batman,"""A bad film with a capable director."" One of the pioneering films that introduced the modern age of the comic book movie, Batman was a phenomenon in its time. As one of those who queued outside the cinema to see it, I was very much caught up in the hype, and at the time the experience of watching it was tremendous fun. Sadly, in retrospect, it's increasingly clear just what a bad film it is, albeit a bad film with a capable director.
It opens well. A well-dressed couple with a young boy wander round the streets of Gotham City arguing and searching in vain for a cab. As they drift into a dark alleyway our attention is gripped. The Batman story is legend. Are we about to see his parents getting killed? But these are not the Waynes, and these are not those dark days when Gotham went undefended. Though he's a little slow on the scene, the caped crusader's arrival, beautifully shot, is certainly dramatic, and we know these criminals will think twice about engaging in such activities again.
Then it all starts to go wrong. Michael Keaton is perhaps the screen's best Bruce Wayne. His middle-aged, shy millionaire is a world away from the flashiness of Christian Bale's interpretation; but unfortunately he doesn't quite convince as the sort of man who would dress up in a rubber bat costume at night for anything other than impressing the sort of girls who make him feel awkward otherwise.
Opposite him, Jack Nicholson's Joker is all ham, flashily entertaining at first but soon too obviously devoid of substance. His method of attack upon the citizens of Gotham - poisoning supermarket products - is hardly exciting, and he's terribly badly scripted, flapping his arms around and howling largely because he has nothing to say.
Caught in between them is Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, a press photographer (whose camera never corresponds with her pictures), who mysteriously obsesses them both, though she has zero personality and surely can't be the only good looking blonde the city has to offer. Having seen what Basinger can do since she's grown old enough to be offered roles with substance, watching her squeal and whimper in this part now is more annoying than ever.
Struggling vainly to cope with all this, Tim Burton throws in a few signature shots that are almost worth the price of admission alone, yet his distinctive style is missing from the film as a whole, so it's not visually satisfying the way that its sequel, Batman Returns, is. The overall impression one gets is that his vision has been heavily compromised by pressure from the studios involved.
The film falls into a no man's land between the sublime comedy of the Adam West classic and the gritty energy of Batman Begins. Despite a handful of good minor performances - Michael Gough is the definitive Alfred - and despite some striking bits of music from Prince, it really has nothing of its own to offer.",JLV_Doc8_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman
158,JLV_Doc9_Batman,"Despite representing his newfound status as a major Hollywood player, Tim BurtonÕs much-hyped 1989 smash Batman remains little more than a curious relic deprived of personality Ð a manufactured widget less influenced by poetic artistry than capitalistic greed. ThereÕs plenty there, for sure, but for a movie so purportedly big, Batman is disconcertingly small, conceptually and visually, as if BurtonÕs own input was deliberately siphoned off lest the end vision be too unique to trust with such potential blockbuster revenue at stake. Whether executive pressure or the sheer intimidation of the production put the squeeze on Burton, the end result has always been one of supreme apathy to these eyes, both in its lack of stylistic fervor and in the impression left on the heart and soul; the film screams out for an expressionistic wallop of action, romance, and fright, but finds only a void of underdeveloped style and halfhearted execution to call its own, as if rushed to completion without a moment's glance at the dailies along the way. A feature-length nip and tuck, it suggests Ð among other things Ð a film edited so as to squeeze in as many showings per day as possible. The beast isnÕt quite soulless, but the flashes of euphoria are so few and far between that it may as well be, if only to put an end to its own misery.

At their best, BurtonÕs films are not unlike miniature universes unto themselves, clearly defined spaces populated as much with people as with teeming feelings and ideas manifest within the visual sphere. This alone would make him a prime choice to breathe life into the world of the Dark Knight, but being loosely cobbled together with matte paintings, poorly shot miniatures and scrunched together sets, BatmanÕs Gotham City feels less like a genuine setting or character than it does a half-hearted production design. The detail work is there but thereÕs no connective thread running throughout the picture, no point of reference by which these characters exist within their cinematic realm. Cutting immediately from the opening wide shot of the cityscape to the ground level of urban decay, Burton fails to grasp the largeness of Gotham, both physically and spiritually; the landscape wants for a sense of placement within and between its scantly established locales (one imagines how much of the budget that went to securing star power would have been better spent producing a more encompassing vision of BatmanÕs world). Ultimately, itÕs Blade Runner for tykes, as the film falls back on preschool conceptions of film noir to suggest the cityÕs sickly moral infestations. From the grizzled, crooked cop who appears ready to die via heart attack at any moment to the shrieking, faceless henchman trained in martial arts by way of Saturday morning cartoons, Batman trades in extreme caricatures played straight, a relative flaw that may have proven otherwise were the film more substantially concerned with its characterÕs supposedly weighty psychological foreplay.

While more recent superhero fare may have rendered Freudian 101 character studies all but moot, at least even the most simplistic of offenders (I'm looking at you, Ghost Rider) at least made an effort to explore their heroesÕ tortured souls. Batman bears witness to Bruce WayneÕs (Michael Keaton) troubled past Ð a fateful encounter that saw both of his parents murdered before his very eyes that ultimately led to his secret life as the caped crusader Ð but fails to connect the characterÕs history to his vigilante activity in ways more than incidental, culminating in a flashback reveal so obvious that it only serves to solidify our billionaire hero as a grade A idiot. Keaton works small wonders given how underwritten the part is, using his subdued charms (as opposed to contrived tics) to emphasize WayneÕs repressed emotions, but the psychological connection to Batman is so tenuous that, whenever he dons the costume, the impact of his screen presence can be said to equal that of The MatrixÕs spoon. The top-billed Jack Nicholson, then, is the one who gets the spotlight, in a performance so overboard that it may very well qualify as the most self-indulgent of his career. It doesnÕt help much that his Joker makeup looks like shit (the characterÕs permanent grin looks less like frozen muscles than a Greek theater mask missing its tragic counterpart), but Nicholson does no favors to his characterÕs thwarted humanity, his constant winking to the audience coming off less like the mannerisms of a madman than the obnoxious antics of a hammered celebrity (one must imagine, though, how leaden the film would be without his chewing of the scenery, given that it already comes close to qualifying as an all-out sleep aid).

Though lack of cohesion can be said to summarize the bulk of BatmanÕs far-reaching flaws, that doesnÕt stop the occasional moment of wonder from shining through, be it the rare instance when a performer approximates the pulpy wonder the film perpetually reaches for, or the handful of shots readily identifiable as coming from BurtonÕs keen and deliberate eye (it's a sad state when the high water mark of a film is the opening credits sequence, here a miniature masterpiece of music and shadows from which the rest of the film could take a lesson or three). Pity, then, that the majority of Batman feels like it was crafted by McDonaldÕs executives intent on selling as many Happy Meals as possible with minimal advertising investment. Even when the scenery proves visually striking, the film rarely fails to shoot it from the most mundane angle possible, editing patchwork sequences together so wildly that one canÕt help but think of Ed Wood, assembling stock footage together from earlier, now dismantled productions. Batman should be a dark and brooding world; rather, itÕs just a hole into which bits and pieces of inspiration have been dumped: blatant attempts at iconic imagery, stock characters lacking necessary genre heft, and a script that mistakes surface scratching for deep probing. Nevertheless, all this and more would prove a worthwhile sacrifice when Burton would go full throttle for the sequel Batman Returns, a film as atmospheric, profound, emotional and thrilling as this unfortunately misbegotten predecessor is not.",JLV_Doc9_Batman,JLV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman
159,JLV_Doc10_Batman,"Tim BurtonÕs generally well-regarded 1989 Batman, starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Michael Keaton as Batman (in that order), set the stage for a franchise that ran four films, with three Batmans and two directors, before collapsing under its own weight. Unquestionably, the series degenerated with each installment before arriving at the abomination that is Joel SchumacherÕs Batman and Robin Ñ yet the seeds of its demise were sown in the very first film.
Review: ItÕs hard to believe Tim BurtonÕs Batman is 30 years old this year. In many respects, it was the film that kicked off the present trend for superhero movies, although it was ultimately with the MCUÕs Iron Man (2008) that the studios fully realised the endless cash cow they could create out of spinning entire connected universes for the fanboy and millennial crowd.

So Batman comes with the baggage of being this form of harbinger for the blockbuster superhero movie, but, rather conversely, its least impressive element is its sense of show and spectacle. ItÕs surprisingly noirish in style (as if Burton was watching a lot of Õ40s studio films in the development period), and Burton evidently spent most of his time fleshing out this stylised, Art Deco look for Gotham City. The visuals are fantastic, but they totally outshine the relative timidity of the narrative that takes place around them.

The film is also on an indecisive precipice between the camp (the ethos of the Õ60s film and TV series, and where Joel Schumacher was to take this run), and the more serious side that Christopher Nolan fully explored in the later Dark Knight trilogy. The camp is perhaps more prevalent though with some particularly lame and silly touches: the action scenes are ever so ropy, and thereÕs a nonsensical moment when Bruce Wayne decides to hang upside down from a bar in the middle of the night, despite his squeeze Vicki Vale being right there in his bedroom (not the most stealthy way to retain his secret identity!)

Saving the flashback over Bruce WayneÕs seminal childhood trauma Õtil a good two-thirds of the way through the film is a clever touch in it gaining more context through the Batman-Joker trajectories weÕve seen to that point. Sadly, the film otherwise is largely unmemorable, save for a typically relaxed turn from Jack Nicholson. Other than its prescience as a pop cultural milestone, this wonÕt go down as one of the better superhero movies, nor even one of the best in the Batman cinematic canon. ItÕs not a complete waste of time. Burton does pull off some striking images, such as the closeups of Batman donning his battle gear, and the closing shot of Batman silhouetted against the Gotham skyline with the Bat-signal in the distance. And Gotham itself, all seamy, steamy alleys and decrepit concrete canyons, is a triumph of art direction.

90,JLG_Doc1_DragMeToHell,"In ""Drag Me to Hell,"" Our Heroine Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) has it all: a good job, a great boyfriend - Clay (Justin Long), and a bright future ahead of her. But in three days, she's going to lose it all. Why, you ask? Is it because she got fired from her job as a loan officer? Did her boyfriend Clay cheat on her, because his rich parents think she's a poor little country girl and he's too good for her? Did things in her bright young life suddenly take such a big turn for the worst that there's no way back? You might say so. (Sounds like some Lifetime drama, doesn't it?) Things have taken a sudden turn for the worst in Christine Brown's life, all right. In three days, she's going to Hell, that eternal place of damnation, fire, and brimstone that all those fancy, big-name religions keep talking about. ""That guy,"" ""Evil Dead trilogy"" director Sam Raimi, returns to his horror roots triumphant with ""Drag Me to Hell,"" which he has co-written with brother Ivan. Of course, he's come a long way since ""The Evil Dead"" (1982) and its sequels (1987's superior sequel ""Evil Dead II"" is my personal favorite of the three); he's spent the last half-decade adapting Marvel Comics' flagship character (and my personal favorite superhero) Spider-Man to the big screen - ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) is my personal favorite superhero film of all time, and is also my #2 favorite film of all time. (Just for the record, though, ""The Evil Dead"" scared the living sh** out of me!!!) If you know Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" movies like you know your own face, then ""Drag Me to Hell"" will be a never-ending delight. It contains much of Raimi's classic manic, frantic horror movie style: frantic pacing, frantic, shaky camera-work, outlandish sights & sounds, fountains and fountains of undead goop and bile, and outlandishly dark humor. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a brilliant hark back to simpler times for Raimi and company. (He's also put some of his horror trademarks to work - quite successfully, I might add - in the ""Spider-Man"" movies.) Raimi also loves to torture his lead characters, many times in the most outlandishly (I'm sure using that word a lot here) over-the-top and comical ways imaginable. In the ""Evil Dead"" movies, it was Bruce Campbell as the horror genre's supreme demon-slayer, Ash; in the ""Spider-Man"" movies, it was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Here, it's Lohman's Christine Brown. As a loan officer with a loving boyfriend and a promotion to assistant manager being dangled in front of her by her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) and the office kiss-a** - Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee) - also vying for the same position, Alison seems to be at a crossroads in her life. So when an old woman, dear old Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) appears at her desk pleading for an extension to try to pay off her mortgage, Christine suddenly gets a cold heart and denies her request. That was not a good idea, because dear old Mrs. Ganush is also a Gypsy with an army of soul-stealing, soul-hungry demons at her disposal. So a Gypsy curse is placed on Christine so that in three days, after three days and nights of non-stop demonic torment, the Dark One will come to claim her soul and drag her to the demonic underworld for all eternity. Clay scoffs at the idea of demons in the real world, but psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) confirms that demonic forces are conspiring to take her soul after three ""hellish"" days. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is living, breathing proof that Raimi has not lost his touch to deliver spine-tingling chills and over-the-top dark humor. He gives us some pretty good scares in this one, constantly changing up the pace to keep us on the edge of our seats. When we think that the latest demonic attack has finally ceased, when everything has gotten quiet, he lets us have it again with another good fright. He even takes time out from the horror to remind us of some real-life horrors, which is our current mortgage crisis (could dear old Mrs. Ganush be our in-theater vocalizing of our pain and suffering in these hard economic times?). Most of Christine's demonic attacks occur in both total darkness and broad daylight. Everyday items come to scare the living daylights out of us as well: cell phones, handkerchiefs, and a fly (yes, a fly!) provides us with one of the film's most unsettling frights. There's also lots of undead goop, spit, and bile that reminds us that ""PG-13"" ratings for horror films still mean something; watch out for that nose bleed!!! And late in the film, Raimi makes a deliberate, jump-for-joy reference to any of the numerous scenes of demonic possession from any of his ""Evil Dead"" movies. Lastly, true to Raimi's style as a director here, just when we think the frights are over and everyone is about to live happily ever after, he sucker-punches us in the gut with a rather bleak ending that truly proves he hasn't lost his touch in delivering the goods. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. Jacked-up ticket prices have caused me to miss out on a lot of good fun at the movies so far this year. But ""Drag Me to Hell"" is the first movie I've seen this year that I've really felt deserved my $8.25. Even though Halloween is not yet upon us, ""Drag Me to Hell"" has instantly become one of my most cherished horror flicks, from one of the genre's premiere talents - Sam Raimi, who has successfully returned to the genre that brought him to fame (or infamy). He has truly scared the hell out of us this time, which few filmmakers in recent years have succeeded in doing.",JLG_Doc1_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
91,JLG_Doc2_DragMeToHell,"To properly (and fairly) access my experience with seeing ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi's (The Gift, Spider Man) much anticipated and blogged about new opus, we must first take a little trip back in time to the year 1995. As a kid, I had always been intrigued by the horror genre, most of which likely spawned from my parent's extreme hatred towards it. While they perused the Comedy and Drama sections of our old video store (then stocked to the brim with VHS tapes, I might add) I found myself sneaking off to the far left corner among the gory, trashy, at often times downright pornographic cover art that adorned the paper sleeves for films such as ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers"" and ""Deadtime Stories"". Like a college freshman introduced to mass quantities of alcohol for the first time with no guidance in sight, I was on overload. What were they attempting to keep me from? If I slid this threw the door of my old Sony T-120, what exactly would I be getting myself into? One would like to think I found the answer that day instead of being forced to watch ""The Jerk"" for the ten thousandth time, but alas, my first experience with the ""terror"" genre began that same year, late at night, in the comforts of my own bed, with a remote control, a freshly fluffed pillow and the Sci-Fi Channel. The words flashed onto the screen, ""The Evil Dead"" in blood red, bold faced lettering. As I watch the plot unfold I found myself paralyzed by the images I was seeing. Humans being possessed by demons, dismembered by their own friends, maniacally laughing in a distorted, demented all together frightening way and above all jumping out at me when I least expected it. I was changed. My outlook on movies changed. My fear of the dark was created and that was WITH commercial breaks. Of course, I have only one man to thank for getting me hooked on the ""Terror"" genre and that is Sam Raimi. After almost twenty years (since ""Army of Darkness"" the final installment of the Evil Dead franchise) Mr. Raimi returns to his old stomping grounds with ""Drag Me to Hell"", the tale of Christine (Allison Lohman, Matchstick Men) a loan officer whom forces Mrs. Ganush, a sick, decrepit gypsy woman from her home by denying her an extension on an already delinquent bank loan. As fate would have it, after work in a desolate parking garage, Christine is attacked and the curse of the Lamia is placed onto her. In the days to follow she is brutally attacked by unseen entities, experiences visions of a deformed Mrs. Ganush and attempts to reverse the curse by contacting psychic mediums. Time is of the essence, but taking the curse off proves to be much more difficult than it was to put on as we witness Christine attempt to silence it before she is dragged to hell. Earlier on, I referred to my obsession with the ""Terror"" genre. Terror differs from Horror in that its goal is to completely terrify the audience as opposed to simply scaring them. ""Drag Me to Hell"" falls into one such category. From start to finish, you make the first plunge down the drop of a 100 minute roller coaster and in the end feel as if you've been tossed around and abused by a master manipulator, Raimi. It is evident, through the use and placement of scares, gore, mixture of comedy and horror as well as pacing of the plot that Raimi didn't have to do much dusting off to get back in the game. He clearly knows that, in this genre, simplicity is often times the best course of action. The storyline and its unraveling is basic, often times boarding on naivety, but the absolute madness that ensues within its walls is comparable to a warm piece of chocolate cake. Allison Lohman (who replaced Ellen Page in early stages of development) does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Page would have brought a bit more grittiness to the role, but that's beside the point. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part. Justin Long as Clay, Christines boyfriend, delivers as always and manages to keep it real in a role that could have very easily turned corny had it not been handled correctly. Supporting cast, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) and Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) the Medium are both convincing in their extremely demanding parts. What's so special about ""Drag Me to Hell"" is that it knows its roots. It takes us back to the days when it was a true ""experience"" to see a horror/terror movie. When you went into a movie theater and the audience jumped, yelled at the screen and quivered in shock and disgust. At the conclusion it brought them to their feet with a standing ovation and all along with the mindset of, ""Okay, we're all in this together, let's make it out in one piece."" ""Drag Me to Hell"" is what a good experience at the movies is all about. There will be those who hate it, loath it even, but for the handful of us that were transformed into obsessed fans of this niche market by a master director, it will validate our love for the genre and will forever stand as a true testament of the best it has to offer. As for myself, for a short moment in time I was a thirteen again, curled up under my covers, frozen with fear, and loving every single minute of it.",JLG_Doc2_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
92,JLG_Doc3_DragMeToHell,"In each of the two great movies opening this weekend, a crotchety old person faces the loss of the family home to cold, impersonal capitalism. On which film should you, the viewer, spend your hard-earned money? Well, if you think you'd enjoy seeing the elderly hero spirit away his home in an inspiring ode to adventure and friendship, you should see ""Up."" On the other hand, if you'd rather watch the old person viciously attack a loan officer, tear out chunks of her hair and place a horrifying Gypsy curse on her soul, then see ""Drag Me to Hell."" How angry are you feeling about the economy, anyway? Sam Raimi's return to horror filmmaking is a satisfyingly, terrifyingly old-fashioned thriller and chiller, all right. Its mix of horror and humor has much more in common with his legendary ""Evil Dead"" series than with the ""Spider-Man"" movies he's spent the past half-decade lucratively helming. It comes complete with a plucky heroine, an ancient curse and bodily fluids sprayed about willy-nilly. As in the best horror movies, ""Drag Me to Hell"" keeps the audience on the edge of hysteria throughout, so that every thump sets the heart racing and every joke earns a slightly out-of-control laugh. So expertly does Raimi (who also wrote the film with his brother Ivan) pull the strings on the viewer that by the end, you'll even find yourself cheering for the loan officer (Alison Lohman) who takes an old lady's house away. As ""Drag Me to Hell"" begins, that loan officer, Christine Brown, is at a crossroads. Her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) loves her, but his upper-crust parents think she's a hick from the sticks. Her boss (David Paymer) is dangling a promotion, but an office suck-up (Reggie Lee) might steal it from her. So when an old woman, Mrs. Ganush (the fearless Lorna Raver), appears at her desk pleading for a little more time to pay off her mortgage, Christine hardens her heart and denies the request. As it turns out, it's not a good idea to foreclose on a Gypsy sorceress with demons at her command. After a very scary encounter with Mrs. Ganush in the parking garage, Christine begins hearing voices, seeing visions and suffering attacks from invisible foes. Clay may scoff, but a psychic (Dileep Rao) confirms that Christine is being stalked by a demon, and in three days she'll be pulled into the underworld forever. A good scare is all about rhythm, and Raimi is a masterly conductor. As Christine's curse progresses, Raimi draws out the tension of each demon attack, using agonizingly long, slow takes and ominous sound effects to drive Christine's panic -- and ours -- to a fever pitch. And then, everything gets . . . quiet. And then all hell breaks loose. But just as you've become acclimated to ""Drag Me to Hell's"" loud-quiet-loud structure -- just when you think that, as in a Pixies song, you can safely predict when the screams will come -- Raimi throws you a change-up, springing a scare when you least expect it. The frightening scenes in ""Drag Me to Hell"" occur in darkness and in daylight, in creepy old mansions and spooky graveyards but also in brightly lit bank branches. Anything can be scary: A handkerchief. A cellphone. Even a housefly plays a central, and squeal-inducing, role. Awash in phlegm, blood, maggots and even embalming fluid, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is nonetheless refreshingly free of the kind of cruelly inventive torture that has characterized recent horror franchises. In fact, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is the rare horror movie that can be survived by people who normally can't take horror movies. It's outlandish enough that it's unlikely to cause nightmares (after all, when are you going to foreclose on a witch?), and Raimi leavens the movie with laughs, albeit dark ones. (Suffice it to say that adorable kittens, whether living or portrayed on iconic motivational posters, have rarely been put to more grimly humorous use than in ""Drag Me to Hell."") And the movie's sucker-punch ending will leave even experienced horror movie fans amazed at Raimi's nerve. What elevates ""Drag Me to Hell"" above the level of exemplary horror movie -- what makes it a garish and loud work of pop art -- is its mix of inventive supernatural gross-outs and carefully observed everyday details. And not just in its treatment of America's mortgage crisis. For many viewers, the movie's most unnerving scene won't be a demon attack at all, but Christine's awkward first dinner with Clay's snooty parents. It's excruciating to watch the four of them making small talk around a formal dining room table, and when the walls started shaking and an eyeball appeared in Christine's cake, I found myself relaxing a little bit. Whew! I thought, as the blood spurted forth. Finally I can stop covering my eyes, and just let Sam Raimi scare the hell out of me.",JLG_Doc3_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
93,JLG_Doc4_DragMeToHell,"For me, Drag Me to Hell was one of the ultimate moviegoing experiences this summer, an opportunity to join with your fellow audience members in laughing, shrieking, and shouting at the screen, with Sam Raimi pulling all the strings behind one of the best horror movies in years. I demanded, begged all my friends to go see it in theaters, insisted that it was the most fun they'd have... and of course Drag Me to Hell made only $42 million domestically. But if DVD is the only opportunity most people will have to see this movie, will it be worth it for them at all? I still maintain what I wrote in my original review: ""It's a movie that demands to be seen with a huge audience, milking every gasp and relieved laugh and even inviting shouting at the screen."" But I also started that paragraph with these two sentences, which come across even more in the film upon a second viewing: ""Behind the camera and in complete control, Sam Raimi comes to Drag Me to Hell with eyes ablaze, taking his genuine love for horror and bestowing it upon the audience like a gift. The story is basic, the gimmicks familiar, the mythology laughable, but Raimi is so confident with what he's presenting, an alchemist mixing comedy and gross-out horror and genuine, expert tension."" Despite the fact that the scares don't translate as well in an empty, well-lit room (you've got to at least watch this one with the lights off), Drag Me to Hell remains a superbly made movie, and a hilarious one, using audience's fear against it as a way to get laughs out of even the grossest, most horrifying stuff. It's not nearly as important as I believed the first time around that you be worried about what happens to Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) as the demon Lamia comes to take her to hell; what matters is just that you follow what Raimi is doing, and whether you're scared or not, be sure to laugh a lot. That's what makes Drag Me to Helldifferent from most horror movies, giving it a rewatch value well beyond when you've figured out the placement of all the scares. The plot, in case you don't remember: Christine is a loan officer at a bank, trying to make her way up the corporate ladder to impress her boss (David Paymer) and beat out unctuous co-worker Stu (Reggie Lee). Trying to prove she can make the ""tough decisions,"" she denies old gypsy woman Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her loan, prompting Mrs. Ganush to meet Christine in the parking garage after work and, after a protracted fight scene, curse Christine to Hell. Aided by her supportive boyfriend (Justin Long), Christine finds out from a psychic that she has three days to somehow banish the Lamia that's been assigned to take her to Hell, and Christine, who once considered herself a good person, realizes she'll do whatever it takes to avoid meeting her fate.",JLG_Doc4_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
94,JLG_Doc5_DragMeToHell,"From the intense opening scene to the stellar and shocking finale, Sam Raimi has officially returned to the horror genre with vigor and spark in the year's best horror film so far. Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver. Christine (Lohman), a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend (Long), is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity, she comes across an old gypsy woman (Raver) who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss (Paymer) tells her it's a tough decision, and its her call, so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated, the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse, one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell. Lucky enough to have won tickets to a pre-screening of the film, I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise, the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny, they can go overboard, but not this one. In fact, I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II. Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film, Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways, this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG-13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense, scary horror films in quite some time, despite the PG-13 rating which many tag as already crap. Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks, and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know, but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing, just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience. Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of scares. Lorna Raver infuses the role with an enthusiasm - an terror - that is rarely seen in big-screen baddies. She has more personality than The Ring's Samara for sure. Clay's character provides a much-needed balance between the goofy and the horrific, and helps make the film's heroine, Christine, all the more believable. It was an interesting twist to see Justin Long in a horror film, despite the nature of his role. I believed his performance and the sincerity of his character. Lohman had a lot resting on her shoulders with this movie, and she totally pulled it off with flying colors. Nobody plays the terrified, but headstrong and determined female lead better than Lohman, and she proves her worth over and over again in this movie. She totally has a career ahead of her. Overall, Drag Me to Hell did more than just impress me nonstop. It was a masterpiece of a horror movie, with unrivaled intensity, scares, and one killer of an ending. More often now, horror directors/writers seem to have such a difficult time ending their movies properly. This one has an ending which snugly solidifies the movie as an early contender for best horror film of the year.

95,JLG_Doc6_DragMeToHell,"On the way to the theater, I tell my buddy ""This has an 8.0 on IMDb, it MUST be good!"" Ummm...No. I've seen better movies on a 3-D View-Master! OK, so the movie begins with the main character, aptly played by the wet-dream-inducing Alison Lohman, getting a cursed placed on her by an old lady who's about to get evicted from her home unless the bank helps her out. Every cliché in the book is thrown at you to get you on the side of Alison, a bank employee who decided to help throw the old lady on the street for the benefit of the bank. (The film-makers resort in their attempt to show remorse towards Alison...to showing the old lady having terrible hygiene, her contempt towards Alison, disgusting habits, and emptying the bank candies into her purse). The old lady, by the way, apparently has ""powers"" the rest of us don't, like the ability to place a deadly curse on others, having super-human strength and tremendous dexterity while fighting, and having the knowledge that Alison could potentially have helped her personally (although she wasn't near the conversation Alison had with the bank manager). The curse described by the old lady then begins happening to Alison. She goes to a palm-reader (a guy who has a knack for not mentioning extremely important things until it's nearly too late) and he tells her that she is cursed. I cannot overstate the stupidity of this palm-reading character (played by Dileep Rao). If there ever was a ""Professor for the Occult"" at your local University, this character would be it! He informs Alison that she would be tormented by a demon for 3 days...then the demon would come for her and drag her to hell. Alison asks Dileep if there is anything that can be done. He says ""Well, you can attempt an animal sacrifice that might appease the demon"". (I thought the word ""might"" wasn't very reassuring for a person in the midst of a fight from hell!) Anyway, Alison doesn't pick up a stray cat or one destined for the back room of her local animal shelter...no, she uses her own precious kitty for the slaughter! After murdering her kitten, she thinks everything is now fine, as a day or so goes by without incident. As the 3-day-clock is ticking down, she gets terrorized by the demon again, goes back to Dileep and proceeds to verbally beat him like a rented mule. Dileep then (AND FINALLY I MIGHT ADD) says ""Well...I know this special lady who does exorcists and can drive the demon out...but it's costly, $10,000, and you need the money tonight."" ** Note, I yelled out in the theater: ""Could you mail that suggestion back to 2 days ago when I originally asked about what can be done?!"" -- the crowd began laughing hysterically! ** Anyway, her boyfriend (played by Justin Long's mangina) gets wind that she needs the 10K and gives it to Dileep on her behalf. I'd like to quickly add this eye-rolling sequence. Alison decides to show up at the old lady daughter's creepy mansion of a house to ask for forgiveness and to tell the old hag that she would help her get the house back. The daughter answers the door and tells her to leave...then oddly lets her in after a rude verbal tongue-thrashing. Alison walks into the house...it's very quiet...she is led through some rooms, down some stairs...then asks ""Where is she?""...and her host says ""Right around the corner""....she turns the corner, and get this, A PARTY IS ENSUING! People drinking, eating, talking...a scene inconsistent with a house that looked as if it hadn't had a visitor in years...and with not many cars parked out in front as Alison walked up...and knowing you hadn't heard a sound the entire time Alison was walking through the house! The scene ends with you finding out that this is actually a gathering for the old lady's funeral. How do you find this out? Alison, not paying attention to where she's walking in an odd house full of strangers, trips over the old lady's casket, making her fall out of the casket and on top of Alison, where the old lady pukes embalming gel all over her face. Wow. You can't make this stuff up. Back to story. Dileep then takes Alison to his psychic friends house. This lady was the most cliché of all the chock-full-of-cliché people in the movie. She was fully equipped with mood-rings, the ugliest new-age jewelry possible, candles galore and items from the occult (one item on her séance table, I noticed, was a dated and dusty jar that was completely empty...oohhhh, scary!). I won't spoil things here, other to say that the exorcism doesn't go well and there's a talking goat. (Yes). After things go badly, and Alison feels she is destined for Hell, Dileep offers up one more piece of advice that would have been best said 2 days ago. (This guy is the king of yesterday's news!) Dileep, amazingly enough, tells her that she can simply give the curse away as a gift...but the recipient would go through the same hell she is and would be dragged to hell themselves in 3 days! Much to my surprise...NOT!...She can't possibly think of ANYONE who she can gift this curse to! She sees an old creaky man...yes!...Oh, his wife shows up, nevermind. She calls her rival at work...she could kill 2 birds with 1 stone by gifting him the curse...Nah, he's too sad now, nevermind! So she decides to, again, get this, go to the graveyard and dig up the body of the old lady so she can shove the gift down her throat! Wow. I told my buddy ""She should give it to George W Bush!"" But, seriously, she couldn't have visited a prison and gave it to a rapist or murderer? That would have required logic I guess...something this movie lacks badly.",JLG_Doc6_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
96,JLG_Doc7_DragMeToHell,"“Drag Me to Hell” finds Sam Raimi returning to his schlocky horror roots, forgoing the polished world of the “Spider-Man” franchise for an enthusiastically made, tongue-in-cheek dose of low-budget horror. With a healthy comic sensibility and plenty of boo moments, it confidently evokes the B movies that groomed Mr. Raimi and many of his colleagues. Still, there’s something missing. The freewheeling spirit that infused “Evil Dead,” which only comes from an artist working completely from the heart, unfettered by the requirements of business or other peripheral influences, is absent here. In many respects, “Drag Me to Hell” feels like the product of an unwieldy amalgamation of the two universes in which Mr. Raimi operates. On one level, it refuses to take itself seriously, crammed as it is with knowing cheesy scares and sly visual puns. At the same time, Mr. Raimi – who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Ivan – introduces characters worth caring about, features quality special effects and sets the film in a California world so engulfed in postcard pretty interiors and lavish horror visuals that his messier impulses are subsumed. It’s rare to complain that a film looks too good, that it seems to have cost too much, but the sharp widescreen visuals make one long for the grainier “Evil Dead” style. Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, an impossibly pretty, wholly insecure loan officer desperately seeking some self-respect. She’s having a hard time finding it; her boss at work (David Paymer) seems to favor a new employee (Reggie Lee) over her for a promotion, and the mother of her professor boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) regards her with open contempt. Thus, Christine jumps at the chance to make the sort of tough decision that stands out to one’s superiors by denying a loan extension to an elderly woman named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). Needless to say, it backfires. Mrs. Ganush places a gypsy curse on her and soon Christine is tormented by terrible visions, with the promise of being dragged to hell in three days’ time. Mrs. Ganush, though suitably deranged, is far too evidently an Eastern European caricature to function as an effective villain. Mr. Raimi opts for rattling pots, creaking doors and the shadowy specter of a supernatural demon stalking Christine to serve as his particular brand of terror. There’s never the sort of grimy psychological torment that gets under your skin. The scenes have been staged effectively, and the filmmaker relentlessly hurls his star into the frenzied abyss. Yet there’s a certain steadfast repetitiveness to them. They’re developed and played out in the same rough style, with the tumultuous activity usually culminating in an apparitional form of Mrs. Ganush lunging at Christine and vomiting something onto her. Had a compelling everyday narrative, or one that sacrificed all real-world pretensions for sheer absurdum, tied together the special effects-heavy sequences, their cyclical nature could have been easier to forgive. Unfortunately, the Raimis expect the audience to become invested in what is ultimately a rather thin overarching conceit – woman sits around waiting to be dragged to hell – and lots of showy comic horror that begins and ends in the same basic fashion. It’s hard to avoid being entertained by “Drag Me to Hell,” but it’s equally hard to avoid feeling like the Sam Raimi who made the “Evil Dead” trilogy has gone the way of the VHS tapes that made it a cult hit.",JLG_Doc7_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
97,JLG_Doc8_DragMeToHell,"Oh no, not another PG-13 horror film! ""But wait,"" you say. ""It's by Sam Raimi."" Perhaps, then, it shouldn't be routinely dismissed as just another tale of demons and ghosts that has been emasculated with the goal of appealing to pimple-faced teenagers who haven't figured out how to sneak into legitimate R-rated features. Raimi, despite having become sidetracked by a certain web-slinging superhero in recent years, has legitimate horror credentials. Not only is his Evil Dead trilogy considered a horror milestone, but he's the only director to have gotten Katie Holmes to doff her top. That alone has to count for something although, had The Gift been rated PG-13, Katie's assets would have remained concealed. So has Raimi achieved the Holy Grail? Has he made a horror film that chills and thrills yet is mild enough to allow admittance to comers of all ages? Sadly, no. But wait... all is not lost. Although Drag Me to Hell mostly fails as horror, it achieves sporadic success as a comedy. The conundrum lies in locating the line of demarcation between intentional and unintentional humor. With Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, Raimi demonstrated that he enjoys spiking his blood and gore with satire, wit, and the Three Stooges. Some of that is in evidence here. Unfortunately, there are also times when the direction and acting are so ham-fisted that intended scares provoke chortles instead of gasps. Even if one shifts mindset and looks at Drag Me to Hell as pure satire, its effectiveness is middling. It feels bloated and overlong and the occasional bursts of laughter don't warrant a 100-minute investment of time. Loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is vying with a co-worker for the vacant position of assistant manager. She needs the promotion not only to secure her future but to impress the parents of her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), who think she's not good enough for their son. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), delights in playing Christine against her rival and watching the sparks fly. One day, a crone with the improbable name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay. She's behind on her payments and is about to lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to take the hard-line to demonstrate her toughness. Mrs. Ganush does not react well to this. A verbal confrontation leads to a physical alteration which culminates in the old woman leveling a curse at Christine's jacket button. Soon thereafter, Christine begins having disturbing visitations by things that go bump in the night, and she solicits the aid of a mystic (Dileep Rao) to rid her of the curse and its associated devil who, after three days of haunting her, will claim her soul and drag her bodily to hell. Before that, she has a conversation with a talking goat and a life-and-death struggle with a psychotic handkerchief. If one wants to analyze the storyline, it's not hard to distinguish allegorical intentions. With Christine representing bankers and Mrs. Ganush standing in for the undertrodden whose circumstances are ignored by greedy capitalists, Drag Me to Hell could be seen as a morality play - Raimi's commentary on the current economic climate. It's tough to take much in this movie seriously, however, since it is constructed in a way that defies thoughtful interpretation. Christine isn't the usual sympathetic victim. She's narcissistic, cruel, and unstable. She's the kind of character you end up rooting against, recognizing that she probably deserves what's coming to her, especially after what she does to a kitten. (Filmmakers don't have a problem doing ugly things to cats in movies; imagine if this had been a puppy.) In fact, after that incident, the guy sitting next to me muttered that he hoped she would die. I'm not sure that's the reaction Raimi was hoping for. Drag Me to Hell doesn't have the correct perspective if audiences are supposed to be rooting for the demon. The screenplay features a clumsily handled last-act twist that should cause acute embarrassment to viewers who don't see it coming. It's as obvious a story contortion as I have ever seen and its recognition transforms the final 20 minutes into an exercise in pointlessness. In fact, this plot element is so abysmal that I expected Raimi to have something else up his sleeve (such as the twist being a blind) - but his arms are bare. Disappointing doesn't begin to describe it. I'm trying to figure out what happened to Alison Lohman's acting ability. She was good in White Oleander and Matchstick Men, but was wooden and unconvincing a few years later in Where the Truth Lies. Here, she's less impressive than in the Atom Egoyan melodrama (where at least she took her clothing off) , evidencing an over-the-top awkwardness. By conventional standards, it's a poor performance, but one has to consider whether that's what Raimi wanted. After all, Bruce Campbell's Evil Dead work was anything but subtle and nuanced. Lohman, however, is not Campbell, who has made overacting into an art form. Justin Long, playing the supportive boyfriend, is okay, but was it really necessary to surround his character with Macs? (It would have been funny to have shown Clay using a P.C., but Long's contract probably forbids that.) I won't argue that Drag Me to Hell is entirely without merit. Parts of it are entertaining, although I'm not convinced they're enjoyable entirely for the reasons intended by the filmmakers. My sense is that Evil Dead II is Raimi's target, but the elements don't all fall into place, and Lohman can't fill Campbell's shoes. There are echoes of the ""old Raimi"" - enough to confuse mainstream PG-13 horror fans but not enough to please his adherents. For those who want to sample Drag Me to Hell's brand of cheesiness, the best approach is to bypass its theatrical release and wait a little while until the DVD shows up in the discount bins at your local S-Mart.",JLG_Doc8_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
98,JLG_Doc9_DragMeToHell,"The title “Drag Me to Hell” offers both literal and ironic inklings to those associated with the movie’s payoff, including the audience. A young woman aspiring for big professional opportunities at a bank makes a grievous error with a mysterious woman who arrives at her desk pleading for help, resulting in a horrific curse that anchors the crosshairs of torment onto her soul for a resulting 100 minutes of loud and foreboding celluloid. Her house thumps with the thundering sounds of something monstrous, and then a shadowy form tosses her around like a torn rag doll. She is attacked in her office garage. Animals hiss and growl as she walks by. She is assailed by visions of a malevolent being who makes clear his purpose of pulling her into an afterlife of endless torture and suffering. And then the movie demands the panic-stricken victim to sacrifice a kitten in a vain attempt to ward off the evil presence… and in that moment, a deplorable line is crossed. For the remaining running time, no more is it our concern as to whether she is going to emerge from the experience in tact or unscathed; the real hell eluded to by said title now becomes the movie theater, where moviegoers go from being surprised and thrilled to completely appalled by some contemptible plot decisions. After a certain point, the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape. The movie is the brain child of Sam Raimi, who was made famous in this genre early on with the “Evil Dead” series, and then departed the trenches of B-movie horror comedy in favor of loftier Hollywood ambitions. The results were eclectic but effective, yielding the marvelous “A Simple Plan,” a taut thriller called “The Gift,” and the box office triumph of the first three “Spider Man” movies. Somehow, after those achievements, Raimi’s mind convinced itself that revisiting the past was a wise decision, perhaps strengthened by the noting that more money for a film budget was as his disposal, and the support of a major studio would give him certain freedoms with this approach that were not allotted to him so many years prior. Sometimes, they say, the past is better left there.The movie stars Alison Lohman as Christine Brown, the would-be heroin of the story, who is basically a collection of insecurities masquerading around under the veneer of opportunistic intentions. She is a financial consultant at a bank, vying for an assistant manager position and doing nearly anything possible to try and impress her indecisive boss, who is also considering a potentially more qualified candidate for the job. Those lofty ambitions are realized when an old and grotesque woman (Lorna Raver) comes to her desk, begging for a third extension on her house’s mortgage. Christine feigns sympathy, but denies the claim and leaves her at the mercy of a foreclosure. The old woman begins causing a public scene by getting on her knees, to which Christine calls security for her removal. Big mistake. The old lady is actually a gypsy, and doesn’t respond very well to being shamed; in fact, she becomes downright horrific in the coming minutes, attacking Christine in her car in a dimly-lit garage, and then cursing her to eternal damnation in three days. What this does is set a chain of events in motion that, for the first hour of the film, are highly entertaining. Raimi’s penchant for immediate shocks is on full display, sometimes startling and at other points almost comical in execution. The sequence in the garage is notably effective; for five continuous minutes, the car-bound physical attack between the angered gypsy and Christine balances implausible (but intentional) laughs with heightened tension, and all of it is executed to, well, alarming gross-out proportions. There is no denying that the director knows exactly what he is doing with the camera, and you are left with the impressing that it submits to his skill as if submissive to some level of fetishistic dominance. Other sequences follow, many equal in value. Christine and her rather innocuous boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long) visit a fortune teller in hopes of figuring out if she, indeed, is cursed by something, and meet Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), who offers more insight into the inner makings of her supernatural predicament than she probably deserves. In repeated intervals, the story requires her to revisit him for spiritual consult, and he in turn provides potential solutions in managing the curse before it ultimately consumes her. The most heinous of these details is in animal sacrifice, which she is uncertain about until another sequence requires more violent tossing around by an unseen presence in her bedroom. Cut to the next scene, in which she stalks her kitten into the laundry room while holding a butcher knife, and then in the next scene is shown burying its bloody corpse in the backyard. This is not a necessary action for any film of this nature, not by any stretch. It reminded me of “The Last Exorcism,” a recent hand-held horror movie, which contains a moment in which a live feline is bludgeoned to death by the very camera viewing the action first-hand. Like this endeavor, that film too derailed any of its momentum simply by resorting to a painful and unusual display of sickening animal torture. Is this really the new trend in today’s horror genre? If so, it highlights a road much darker and cruel than warranted. Horror leaves nothing untouched and punished, perhaps, but a truly effective picture is made so by the notion that anyone victimized by evil can, and will, be given the chance to fight back. By making a victim out of something so harmless, “Drag Me to Hell” becomes so deranged that it loses its right to entertain us beyond that first hour, and everything that follows becomes viewed with a persistently unsatisfying aftertaste. The ending of the movie is also muddled, with the last twenty minutes or so feeling curiously overwritten. The result is a triple climax conveyed without rhyme or reason, and remaining conflicts become so dissonant with the rhythm established in the first hour that all patience is tossed out the window. The intention here is probably very innocent, almost hysterical. Sadly, what “Drags Me to Hell” ultimately represents is the continued nagging emotion that horror, even with comedic underpinnings, is becoming too nihilistic for its own good. The disbelief can no longer be suspended, and the levels to which any filmmaker, including Raimi, will sink to in order to shock are moving past certain boundaries dangerously fast. Indeed, to reflect on your past glories as a filmmaker can be powerful for a man who has come as far as this. But he has grown up into something much more, and one can’t help but feel the proper way to echo the glories of the past would be to live in the present, not revisit a sensibility that can no longer be spoken with the same level of untrained humor as before.",JLG_Doc9_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
99,JLG_Doc10_DragMeToHell,"When I was in elementary school, we had a classmate named Dong that would cry at the drop of the hat. Let’s not confuse Dong with Vinny, however, who would literally cry if the breeze hit him the wrong way. Dong would really only cry when we teased him and we soon found, as little shit kids love to do, the easiest way to push the poor lad to tears.“Dong, the gypsies are coming,” we would chant. “The gypsies are coming to take to you away.” Even though we had no idea what a gypsy was or why they were purported to steal children, such provocation turned Dong into a blubbering mess. Once he even threw at chair when someone pushed him too hard. I hope to hell that poor Dong does not see Drag Me to Hell, Sam Raimi’s return to the splatter flick genre that made him famous after years making mainstream blockbusters such as Spider-Man. See, Drag Me to Hell features one very pissed off Gypsy woman who, like all Gypsies must do in horror films, curses poor Alison Lohman’s Christine after she refuses to grant her an extension on her housing loan.More a comedy-horror in the vein of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness rather than a film created to inspire fear in the hearts of intrepid viewers, Drag Me to Hell allows Raimi the opportunity to return to his old tricks of Three Stooges-type body humor and a chance to play with beasties that spew goo and like to scream in distorted voices. See, poor Christine isn’t all bad. A momentary lapse of better judgment and the desire to wrest a promotion away from a brown-nosing, shitbag colleague (Reggie Lee) informs her decision to foreclose on the Gypsy’s house. Call it the wrong place at the wrong time, but this choice gets Christine a one-way curse to hell when her despondent client sics an angry demon on her ass. Unfortunately, Lohman does not possess the natural charisma Bruce Campbell brought to the Evil Dead series and her ersatz charm is not enough to carry the picture. Supporting players like boyfriend Clay (Mac-guy Justin Long) and spiritual guru Rham (Dileep Rao) have neither the acting chops nor the script to be anything more than incidental characters. So the entire production rests on the shoulders of Lohman and her battle against an invisible goat-demon named the Lamia. Raimi will never be a great filmmaker, but Drag Me to Hell is more a series of squirm-inducing scenes than a cohesive film. Sure, there are plenty of gross-out scenes (including a classic battle between Christine and the Gypsy in a moving car), but rather than amount to a film that really chills the bones, Raimi mixes “gotcha!” moments with scenes so over the top, there is nothing to do but laugh. Drag Me to Hell will never be more than a minor work in Raimi’s oeuvre, mainly because it’s really nothing new for him. After the past decade where Spider-Man made up 3/5 of the director’s films (the other being limp Southern gothic The Gift), Drag Me to Hell feels more like a doodle, a sketch from an artist needing to rejuvenate himself before heading back into the arachnid fold that puts food on the table. What Drag Me to Hell lacks, unlike Raimi’s best work in Darkman, Spider-Man 2 and A Simple Plan is the rich characterization that meshes seamlessly with his horrific vision. There is nothing in here that resonates. Someone is dragged to hell, the credits roll and we cease to care.",JLG_Doc10_DragMeToHell,JLG,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
190,JSA_Doc1_PitchBlack,"It's Vin Diesel week! Suddenly, this largely unknown actor, whose only significant credits were a part in Saving Private Ryan and some voice work in The Iron Giant (as the title character), is a hot commodity with significant roles in two films opening the same day. Diesel fans are strongly advised to see both Boiler Room and Pitch Black, as they show different aspects of the actor's range. In Boiler Room, he's a regular guy working a regular job. In Pitch Black, he goes into full Arnold Schwarzenegger mode, flexing his muscles, grunting, and uttering the occasional one liner. It's not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb.

Pitch Black can be viewed as a slick, stylish version of the kind of outer space creature feature that is typified best by the Alien movies. At its best (which is quite often), Pitch Black is an entertaining effort. On the down side, there are times when various largely anonymous characters wander around in the dark and do incredibly stupid things while being stalked by vicious alien creatures. As they get picked off one-by-one, the only question is who's going to be next.

The last time writer/director David Twohy wandered into the science fiction arena, the result was the surprisingly intelligent and involving The Arrival, about an alien infestation on Earth. For most of Pitch Black, Twohy has brought the same level of thoughtfulness to this screenplay. The initial half-hour, which details the crash-landing of a spaceship on a barren desert planet, is particularly good. Once the first alien makes its appearance, things become routine from a storyline perspective, but the level of suspense escalates. To fill in the dead spots between alien attacks, we are treated to a series of recycled interpersonal conflicts. And, for those who are bothered by such things, the film's so-called ""science"" employs a few key violations of the laws of physics.

The movie begins with the crash, a violent concussion that leaves most of the crew and passengers dead. Among the handful of survivors are Fry (Radha Mitchell), the pilot; Johns (Cole Hauser), a police officer; Riddick (Diesel), a convicted murderer who is being transported in chains; and Inam, a holy man (Keith David). The planet is an apparently lifeless wasteland - a desertscape where three suns assure that there is no night and possibly no water. Shortly after the rough landing, Riddick escapes, but, while the survivors are looking for him, they too are being hunted - by a species of alien that shuns the daylight but is lethal in the dark. Soon, with the realization that the world is about to be plunged into blackness by an inconvenient total eclipse, everyone must learn to trust Riddick, who can see in the dark, if they are to survive. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Riddick's primary goal is self-preservation or redemption.

The acting is solid, if largely unremarkable. Most of the principals have fallen effortlessly into the stereotyped roles of quirky characters who are basically waiting to be the aliens' next meal. (Although there are a few surprises when considering who lives through the carnage. I definitely did not correctly predict the composition of the surviving group.) The performers to rise above are Diesel, who relishes the larger-than-life opportunity, and Radha Mitchell, who gives a convincing portrayal of a tough, emotionally conflicted woman. There's a little of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Fry, but this is not a direct copy. For the Australian-born Mitchell, who has done her share of work on the indie scene (Love and Other Catastrophes, High Art), this represents an opportunity to be seen by a wider audience.

Pitch Black has a stylish look. The outdoor sequences, which are nearly monochromatic to emphasize the color-leeching power of the multiple suns, are effectively photographed. After the eclipse occurs, there are some genuinely creepy sequences featuring packs of aliens honing in on the protagonists, who are only able to keep them at bay by waving around lights. For the most part, the special effects are first-rate - I was impressed by the scene of a ringed planet sliding across the sky on its way to block out the sun. These strong visuals complement a workmanlike script, resulting in a consistently engaging science fiction/horror excursion.",JSA_Doc1_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
191,JSA_Doc2_PitchBlack,"No other movie opening thrills me more than a vast ship in interstellar space. The modern visual rules for these shots were set by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" which used a detailed model moving slowly instead of a cheesy model moving fast. Kubrick had the good sense to know that sound does not travel in space, but ""Star Wars,"" with its deep bass rumbles, demonstrated that it certainly should. And then in the ""Alien"" and ""Star Trek"" pictures and in countless others, gigantic space cruisers aimed majestically at the stars, and I felt an inner delight that has its origins in those long-ago days when I devoured pulp space opera by Robert Heinlein and such forgotten masters as Murray Leinster and Eric Frank Russell.
My state of mind is best captured by a pulp mag that was defunct even before I started reading science fiction: ""Thrilling Wonder Stories,"" without doubt the best title in the history of magazines. I hope for strange and amazing adventures. Sometimes I am gratified. More often I am disappointed. ""Pitch Black,"" which begins in deep space and ends with a manhunt on a desert planet, falls somewhere in between: clever, done with skill, yet lacking in the cerebral imagination of the best science fiction. How sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions.
The movie begins during an interstellar mission, with the crew and a dangerous prisoner all in cryo-sleep. The ship collides with a cluster of rock fragments, which penetrate the hull like BBs through cellophane. The captain and several other sleepers are terminally perforated, and Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes command. The ship crash-lands on a planet that circles somehow within a three-star system, where at least one sun never seems to set, and the surviving crew members have to fight it out with the vicious and cunning prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).
You may remember Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where he was the hard-bitten Pvt. Caparzo. He looks like a mean customer, and he is. He shares no fellow feeling with the other survivors, expresses no responsibility to them, does not consider himself in the same boat and thinks only of escaping. Oh, and his eyes have a remarkable quality: He can see in the dark. Not a very useful ability on a planet with three suns and no night, right? (Hollow laugh.) What disappointed me about ""Pitch Black,"" directed by David Twohy, is that it didn't do more with its alien world, and less with its recycled human conflicts. I feel underwhelmed when humans land on another world and are so quickly reduced to jumping out from behind rocks at one another and playing hostage games. ""Pitch Black"" does have a nice look, all bleached blues and desert sands. And there are some promising story elements, one of which I am about to discuss, so you might want to set this review aside if you plan to see the movie.
The spoiler commences: Yes, night does fall on the planet, every once in a long while when all three suns are in eclipse. I am not sure what complex geometries of space and trajectory are necessary for a planet to exist in a three-star system and somehow manage to maintain any continuity of climate and temperature, but never mind: What is maybe more difficult to accept is that it would develop a life form that appears only in the dark.
Since sunlight is the source of heat and energy, Darwinian principles would seem severely challenged by the task of evolving living things that hibernate for 22 years between eclipses. How does a thing that lives in the dark evolve in a planet where it is almost always daytime? This is not the kind of question you're supposed to ask about ""Pitch Black,"" but I'd rather have the answer than any 45 minutes of this movie.
The story also poses the problem (less challenging from a Darwinian view, to be sure) of whether the Diesel character will cooperate with his species mates or behave entirely like a selfish gene. Whether this happens or not I leave it to you to discover. By the end of the movie, however, I was wondering if the trip had been necessary; most of the plot could be ported into a Western or a swashbuckler with little alteration.
For Twohy, it's a step backward from ""The Arrival"" (1996), one of the smartest recent science-fiction films--one that really does develop suspense out of challenging ideas of alien conduct (space visitors are secretly warming the Earth to their comfort zone).
My suggestion for his next film: an expedition to the seas beneath the ice of Io, where volcanic warmth may have allowed life to occur. Consider the physical properties of a life form that evolves under the tiny gravity of such a moon. It could be amorphous, tenuous and enormous. In sailing a stellar sub through the seas of Io, you might be navigating not toward life, but . . . through it. What would a human crew do in such a situation? Not get into fights and start chasing one another through the sub, I hope.",JSA_Doc2_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
192,JSA_Doc3_PitchBlack,"It's sci-fi season once again, what with this opening volley from Twohy (The Arrival) and a deuce of Mars films on the event horizon. Pitch Black, however, offers precious few twists on its timeworn storyline. Mankind's innate fear of the night is at the heart of Pitch Black: It's Wait Until Dark in space, with the razor-blades-and-scotch vowels of Vin Diesel fronting for Audrey Hepburn, and several thousand omnivorous proto-swallows nicely filling Alan Arkin's shoes. It's also more than a tad reminiscent of James Cameron's Aliens and perhaps even Jurassic Park -- but this last is meant in a good way. (The film wears its homages on its sleeve like a badge of honor.) Most of the time, the film coasts by on dollops of gore and weak suspense, but it's impersonal to the point of being almost existential, which makes the whole thing adrenally invigorating, sort of like a closed MRI with scary pictures taped two inches above your eyes. The film opens with everyone's hyper-sleep being rudely disturbed as a space transport ship carrying 40 passengers is knocked off course by the tail of a wayward comet. Docking Pilot Fry (Mitchell, of High Art) manages to land the ship on an desert planet that features three suns which cause permanent daylight. The survivors include bounty hunter Johns (Hauser) and his murderous prisoner Riddick (Diesel), who is chained, blindfolded, and has a bit in his mouth. A trio of others, including a young stowaway, make up the rest of the landing party, and while the first business at hand is to find water, there's also the disturbing matter of what, exactly, killed all the giant creature skeletons that litter the dusty landscape. As it happens, the bone-owners were stripped of their epidermals by a subterranean, nocturnal species that resembles more than anything flying hammerhead sharks crossed with spiders, and as the planet enters a total solar eclipse, guess who's coming to dinner? That's the setup and things follow more or less predictably from there to the film's resolution. Much of the fun in Twohy's film (and it is fun) comes from his clever use of sound; for a film that takes place in so much darkness, Twohy wisely teamed with Lucas Digital Ltd., Inc. to provide the myriad howlings and hootings of the planet's native species (as well as some well-done opening disaster shots), and the enhanced audio makes a world of difference. Twohy and cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) also make the most of some interesting film stock choices, going for a hideously washed-out look during the film's overexposed triple-daylight scenes and then wiping it all out with the deep, organic blacks and blues of the night shots. Say what you will about the story, but Pitch Black at least looks and sounds stunning. As Riddick, Diesel makes the most of his character's gruff otherness (The angle? He can see in the dark) and Mitchell is, as always, easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast, though, might as well have the word victim stamped on their foreheads. Not at all a bad film, as these things tend to go, Pitch Black is instead a very streamlined exercise in interplanetary mayhem and the logistics of the body count. Its lack of a backstory (who, exactly, are these people and where are they going?) makes it even more mysterious, which I suspect was Twohy's intention to begin with. Is it a fun time killer? Sure. Is it scary? That depends on the extent to which you're afraid of the dark.",JSA_Doc3_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
193,JSA_Doc4_PitchBlack,"Packed with razzle-dazzle special effects and fueled with aggressive, hyperactive cinematography and a pulse-pounding narrative that never lets the tension subside until the final frame, ""Pitch Black"" is the movie of the season for sci-fi and horror fans. I'm not going to try to convince you that this tale of a group of space-crash survivors facing unknown danger on a mysterious planet is a greatly original work. Although it's the splashiest cutting-edge effects picture since ""The Matrix,"" it lacks that work's epic, synthetic sweep. But if your taste runs to that flavor of eye candy, ""Pitch Black"" will rock you. It's a tightly constructed genre picture, combining the best paranoid thrills of the ""Alien"" series with the setting of ""Mad Max"" and the anti-Utopian future of ""Blade Runner.""
This is apparently Vin Diesel's big week. In this film, playing Riddick, a sinister, laconic convict with hidden depth, he looks like the first new action star of the 2000s. Meanwhile, in the next chamber of the multiplex, you can see him as a youthful stock-trading shark in the ensemble drama ""Boiler Room."" (Previously, Diesel had a small role in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and was the voice of ""The Iron Giant."")
Riddick is a muscular badass, a multiple murderer who apparently shaves his head with axle grease. ""Human blood has a coppery taste,"" he tells Johns (Cole Hauser), the bounty hunter entrusted with taking Riddick back to prison. ""If you cut it with peppermint schnapps it goes away."" But the wiseguy dialogue doesn't conceal a certain soulful intelligence, even sadness, in Riddick. He's a real cool killer whose still waters run deep, not just another snarky asshole in the Schwarzenegger mold. When a Muslim cleric (Keith David) among the castaways accuses him of lacking faith, Riddick avers, ""I absolutely believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.""
Johns, Riddick, the imam, spacecraft captain Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell) and a motley handful of other renegades are the only survivors of a crash-landing on an unknown desert planet, where the combination of three suns means that night never falls. The crash sequence itself, which opens ""Pitch Black,"" is an electrifying thrill ride of chaotic digital animation and distorted photography, which lets you know right away that director David Twohy, cinematographer David Eggby and their collaborators are planning to kick out the jams. While struggling to find water and food on this harsh, apparently uninhabited sphere -- rendered by Eggby (who was, in fact, the cinematographer on ""Mad Max"") in harsh, surreal yellows and blues -- the gang makes a number of unhappy discoveries.
There were humans, probably a team of geologists, living on the planet at one time, but something bad happened to them exactly 22 years earlier. The thing that happened was a total eclipse, leaving the planet in darkness and summoning something -- actually, very many, very hungry somethings  from beneath the surface. The rest of ""Pitch Black"" follows the familiar pattern of a desert-island or haunted-house movie, as our plucky band, trapped in the darkness with their batteries and fuel supply rapidly fading, feud among themselves as they're picked off one at a time.
I won't spoil the ""Pitch Black"" monsters for you except to say that you never get a really good look at them, which is almost always a good idea. There's a little Alien to them, a little pterodactyl, maybe a little bat. Twohy's handling of the sense of unknowable menace, the interplay of a little light and a lot of darkness, as the survivors huddle together against the whispering, scratching hordes of Others, is truly masterful.
While Diesel's performance as the enigmatic Riddick is clearly the star-making turn here, Twohy (who co-wrote the screenplay with brothers Jim and Ken Wheat) has created a compelling little character drama in which most people aren't what they seem. The tough and resourceful Caroline doesn't really want the other castaways to know how she tried to save her ship just before the crash; her uneasy alliance with Riddick may have something to do with their shared sense of guilt. Johns, who at first seems to be an upstanding lawman, may be less trustworthy or honorable than the murderer he's transporting. The imam, played by David with quiet integrity, must face the most painful test his faith can imagine. We get a bit of comic relief from Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), a fussy antiquities dealer anxious to hold on to his rare wines and New Guinea tribal artifacts; every ""Lost in Space"" must have its Dr. Smith and every ""Gilligan's Island"" its Professor.

That said, most genre fans will focus on the apparently bottomless bag of sound-and-vision tricks employed by Twohy, Eggby, production designer Graham Walker and effects supervisor Peter Chiang. Riddick, as it turns out, got black-market implants shot into his corneas before escaping from an underground maximum-security prison, so occasionally we benefit from his infrared vision, revealing the besieging predators as explosive yellow-white blobs against a crimson background. Then there's the black-and-white, digital crittervision that sometimes shows us how the humans look from the winged marauders' perspective. If you have a weak stomach, ""Pitch Black"" might not be for you. I don't mean because there's a lot of gore (there isn't) but because of Eggby's skittering, whirling, always-subjective camera angles; ""The Blair Witch Project"" feels like Merchant-Ivory by comparison.
""When the dying starts,"" Riddick tells Johns, ""this little psycho-fuck family of ours is going to tear itself apart."" He's both right and wrong, of course. If ""Pitch Black"" is ultimately a formula picture in which the rogue outsider must learn the value of sacrifice and togetherness, the formula is dispatched with a nimble, respectful touch. With the ""Alien"" and ""Hellraiser"" series long out of gas and with Wes Craven apparently retiring, the mid-budget horror genre badly needs some new blood. With this bravura effort, Twohy (whose previous film, an alien-invasion flick called ""The Arrival,"" was nothing special) looks like the new sheriff in town, with Diesel as his enforcer. Long may they rule.",JSA_Doc4_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
194,JSA_Doc5_PitchBlack,"Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) cant seem to remain unconscious in cryosleep like the other 40 or more civilians and officers resting stationarily in their chambers aboard a space transport. Hes the only prisoner of the group, which prompts him to contemplate the many opportunities for escape that may present themselves over the course of the 41-week journey. When a meteor shower causes excessive damage, causing the crew to be automatically awoken prematurely, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) inherits a command position after learning that Captain Tom Mitchell has perished. And then a tumultuous crash-landing plunges them all into darkness.
With the back half of the ship torn away, its obvious that the desert planet (boasting three suns) on which they stumbled will be their new home for some time. William Johns (Cole Hauser) is in charge of Riddick, who poses a conundrum, as hed previously broken out of a maximum-security prison. Blindfolded and gagged, Riddick is additionally chained to a beam; but its not enough to hold the man forever. A handful of survivors scour the wreckage, gather usable supplies, and hope to locate water  but they have more pressing things to worry about as well, such as the ravenous indigenous life.
The sets are instantly amusing, though theyre obscured by a precise color scheme that turns the imagery black-and-white with hints of various tints. Shadowy locales are bluish, while sun-scorched sand dunes are yellow; other colors are virtually nonexistent. If it didnt feel as if utilized to hide mediocre special effects, the palette might have been more effective. Distorted images, slow-motion in unnecessary moments, repeated camera angles, and rapid cuts also generate visual curiosities, which numb the effectiveness of the cinematography and action-oriented violence. Nevertheless, the exploration of the planet holds additional intrigue, particularly as the unprepared passengers investigate abandoned outposts and encounter other inhabitants.
All you people are so scared of me. Most days I take that as a compliment. But it aint me you gotta worry about now. Pitch Black isnt smart sci-fi; instead, its boilerplate survival horror, preoccupied with death, destruction, and monsters. Likewise, its the type of thriller that employs a muscular hero and capable female sidekicks with obligatorily bared midriffs. Theres also a curious subplot about idolizing Riddicks notoriety, with two teenaged survivors emulating his dress and demeanor  which doesnt quite fit with the rest of the action. Fortunately, this leads to a couple of surprises (chiefly in the order of demises), which proves a certain level of storytelling bravery from writer/director David Twohy.
The dependence on CG antagonists, however, is a pity, as they doesnt hold up nearly as well as practical models (plus, inconsistencies abound with the designs, principally when the aliens swarm in the millions yet attack in small groups, perhaps a dozen at a time). This is true of the bloodshed, too, whose creativity suffers from unconvincing executions. The suspense fares better, especially when the characters are hunted down one by one in the inky confines of spaceship corridors or underground tunnels by toothy creatures that fear light. Riddick isnt the most innovative protagonist for a job like this, but his persona is macho enough to take the place of a more recognizable he-man (like a Stallone or Schwarzenegger). As for the supporting cast, theyre given a dash of humor, credible cursing, and plenty of panicky infighting, generating a group dynamic that is reminiscent of Aliens or The Thing (Keith David has a role here, coincidentally)  just without a supremely satisfying conclusion.",JSA_Doc5_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black

A passenger spaceship is hit by a rogue asteroid or comet and is forced to make a crash landing on a strange, barren planet that has three suns. The survivors include one crew member, a Muslim pilgrim and his family, an eccentric traveler, a couple of other passengers (i.e. alien food), a cop, and a prisoner named Riddick. All have their own dark secrets and hidden pasts.
The survivors soon discover an abandoned geologic research station nearby. All of the scientists are gone, and we quickly find out why. Bizarre, bat-like nocturnal creatures live under the ground in the dark. They seem to be very hungry, too, and the scientists were their last meal. Take a creature from Aliens, mix it with a bat, a panther, and a hammerhead shark and you have these critters. There are also smaller, faster flying versions, too.
The survivors realize they must stick together if they will make it off the planet, however most all of them are selfish in their own way. The motto of the group seems to be 'Let's stick together, because when the monsters come I only have to run faster than you to get away!' Can they make it out alive?
They must transport some power cells to a small spacecraft at the outpost in order to get off the planet. But (and there's always a 'but') a rare eclipse of the three suns takes place and the planet becomes dark. The creatures then come out in force and the race to get away is on. Only light keeps the creatures at bay, but how long will that last?
THE GOOD:
THIS IS THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION FILM OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM!!!!!!!
(Well, actually the millennium is only one and a half months old, and it technically doesn't start till January 2001, but I wanted to see if I could get quoted like Harry Knowles in Pitch Black ads. :) )
Truthfully, I enjoyed this film. I wanted a good popcorn flick with cool effects and a lot of action, and that's what I got. The plot is not particularly deep, but for what it sets out to do, it does well.
The cast was well chosen. Vin Diesel was excellent as the prisoner Riddick. He¿s tough, he's mean, and he's definitely no good guy, but you begin to like him nevertheless. Diesel played the part very well and I'd definitely like to see him play this character again. I think he'd be great in other action flicks. The rest of the cast did good jobs as well.
The special effects weren't ground breaking caliber, but they were still good. The ship crash had some excellent moments and there is one particular scene where the creatures take flight at the beginning of the eclipse that is memorable. A really beautiful shot as clouds of the creatures swarm in the sky with the eclipse as a background.
To make the planet a little more otherworldly, colored filters were used to give everything a different hue as if there was an alien sun and sky. I didn¿t like the effect at first, but in the end it did help make the terrain a bit less earth-like.
I also liked some of the clever shots at the beginning when Riddick gets away and is stalking the survivors. Definitely one of the funnier parts of the film.
Though this film borrows from Aliens, it is a little taste of what I hoped one of the Aliens sequels would have been. I always wanted Ripley and the Marines to go to the Alien homeworld, and I couldn't help but think this is a little bit of what that would have been like. (They did in the Dark Horse comics, but that¿s another story.)
In any case, I was in the mood for this movie, so I enjoyed it.
THE BAD:
I didn't care for some of the filming techniques. Occasionally, the camera would shake all over the place. As Mr. Cranky once said in a review, it seemed as if the camera was strapped to a chimp to film the scene. All it did was make what was going on more confusing, and left me scratching my head as to what happened. Fights should be beautifully choreographed and appreciated, while this effect just seemed to cover everything up. There were also random slow motion shots that seemed to me to serve no purpose, and every once in a while the frame would be squashed and distorted for some sort of artsy effect.
The story seemed to take its natural course, however, that unfortunately led to a rather anti-climactic ending. I was hoping for some big money shot and a slam bang finish, but it didn't happen. Maybe if the film had a bigger budget we would have seen more, but that wasn't to be.
There were also some statements about God in the film. The Muslim keeps reaffirming his faith even though all these bad things happen to him, and Riddick ridicules him for his belief. I kept thinking by the end some statement would be made on faith one way or another, whether it be Riddick finding his faith or the Muslim losing his, but neither happened. Seemed like a missed opportunity.
THE UGLY:
I'd say being ripped in half by a cloud of flying bat-alien creatures qualifies as ugly, eh?",JSA_Doc6_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
196,JSA_Doc7_PitchBlack,"There are just no good aliens anymore. The title character from 1979's ""Alien"" - the film which set the watermark in the genre of which ""Pitch Black"" is a part - was a living, breathing, frightening, fully-realized creation. In the last 21 years, there have been a plethora of ""Alien"" rip-offs, but none of them seemed to realize that what made ""Alien"" work was not the scares or the gore, but the creature itself.
By their very nature (they only come out at night, after all) we never get a good look at the creatures in ""Pitch Black"". They fly like winged furies with a force that shakes the camera as they pass, but we learn very little about how the creatures live, except by the educated guesses of the characters (which are seemingly always correct).
The non-computer generated cast is competent as a whole. Radha Mitchell (High Art) holds her own nicely as Fry, the tough captain-by-default. Vin Diesel snarls and portends his way through the role of a criminal with a vague record of evil deeds.
""Pitch Black"" has the clever idea of making its creatures only come out when it's completely dark. This gives director David Twohy (The Arrival) the unenviable challenge of lighting his actors with the minimal amount of wattage. Naturally, a movie can't be totally dark - unless, of course, it has the budget of ""The Blair Witch Project"" - so there are occasions when it is unclear where the ambient light is coming from. But, as a whole, Mr. Twohy does a good job keeping his characters in the dark.
More startling, however, is the first third of the movie, which takes place in the blazing light of three suns (oddly, the planet doesn't seem hot so much as bright). By supersaturating the film stock, among other trickery, the planetary landscape actually seems very alien - unlike the usual Southern California-scapes in sci-fi film and TV.
""Pitch Black"" largely incorporates pieces from other sci-fi films. Thankfully, it steals from the best. There is a female pilot/heroine (a la Sigorney Weaver in ""Alien""), there's a shackled convict (a la Hannibal Lechter), and there's a spaceship load of false scares to keep the audience screaming. The script, co-written by Mr. Twohy, has enough clever nuances to keep things interesting. Mr. Diesel's character, for example, has surgically augmented eyes which allow him to see in the dark (what luck!). Unfortunately, there is also a ludicrous macho battle between Mr. Diesel's character and his bounty hunter, and plenty of get-us-off-this-rock dialogue. Thankfully, the irony of landing on a planet with three suns only days before a total eclipse isn't lost on the film.
As expected, the real star of the film is the special effects work and, in all honesty, some of the shots (the eclipse scene in particular) are beautiful. If only there had been as much time spent on creating believable aliens as there obviously was on the landscape.",JSA_Doc7_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
197,JSA_Doc8_PitchBlack,"Is it an active contempt for the audience, I have to wonder, that propels a movie like Pitch Black through production, or is it mere laziness on the part of the filmmakers combined with the unspoken assumption  generally an accurate one  that moviegoers will watch just about anything with spaceships and lots of gore? Did some executive, considering greenlighting this script, chuckle evilly to himself while calculating precisely how insulting a movie he could produce and still have a decent opening weekend? Or was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was?
Aliens meets The Fugitive meets Con Air, is probably how writer David N. Twohy pitched his script. (Also credited as writers are Jim and Ken Wheat, which simply screams of fanboy brothers who wrote and, god knows how, managed to sell a spec script that had to be even more horrendous than whats onscreen, if the more experienced Twohy had to rewrite it.) Twohy  who actually did write The Fugitive, with Jeb Stuart  is also responsible for writing and directing another piece of junk science fiction, The Arrival, which is at least enjoyable on a Mystery Science Theater level. With Pitch Black, though, he descends to a new level of awfulness, in which even the films highly derivative nature cannot make for campy fun. Pitch Black is not good clean bad fun  it is an insidious offense to any even halfway-demanding movie fan.
Pitch Black starts out, if not exactly promising, then at least momentarily gripping. A commercial freight and passenger ship, traveling through deep space, encounters a meteor storm  the small projectiles that rip through the ship are enough to do it serious damage, as well as kill the captain as he sleeps in his cryo chamber. The pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), awakened by the ship to deal with the emergency, finds her ship already burning up as it screams through the atmosphere of a planet. In an intense, protracted sequence, the ship breaks up as Fry fights for control of it and manages to guide it to a not entirely disastrous crash landing on the planets surface.
Its the kind of sequence at the end of which you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief along with the characters. But Pitch Black immediately thereafter starts a long slide downhill that doesnt stop until the end credits roll
Only a handful of the ships passengers have survived, including Johns (Cole Hauser: Good Will Hunting), a law-enforcement type, and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel: The Iron Giant, Saving Private Ryan), a thoroughly psychotic multiple murderer who, natch, has escaped his industrial-strength restraints in the crash. Besides Fry, theres also a Muslim imam (Keith David: Armageddon, Volcano) and several of his young sons, a teenage boy, and sundry others.
The planet, a seemingly lifeless, endless desert under brutal assault by three suns, fortunately has an atmosphere entirely breathable by humans. The unlikeliness of humans landing by chance on a planet capable of sustaining them is typical of the kind of disregard for reality science-fiction films display, and it could be forgiven if that disregard didnt get much worse.
There are, our little band discovers rather unpleasantly, nasty creatures living underground, big, flying things with huge teeth that look like a cross between bats and H.R. Gigers aliens. And they have a taste for human blood.
My question is, Why? Why would these creatures be the least bit interested in humans? Predators and their prey develop in symbiosis, and humans and the aliens are products of entirely separate lines of evolution. Okay: Im getting too egghead. Ill ask a simpler question: What do these things live on when there are no humans around, which is most of the time? This planet has no ecology to speak of  these creatures are the only living things around. There is nothing for them to eat. Nothing. It makes no sense.
Okay  still too intellectual. I shouldnt be thinking this much about whats meant to be a check-your-brain-at-the-door flick. But how much brainlessness are we meant to endure? After the discovery of the hungry creatures, Pitch Black becomes a standard and then there were none sci-fi horror flick. But it relies entirely on characters doing stupid, illogical things for no reason other than, if they didnt, thered be no story.
Did I mention that theres almost always one sun in the sky of this planet? There is no night  except once every 22 years, when an eclipse blots out the suns. (Earth years? This planets years? The concepts are used interchangeably, which, again, makes no sense  the chances of this planet and Earth having years of the same length are next to nil.) Fry discovers this when the group stumbles across a long-abandoned camp obviously used by a geological survey team, where Fry finds a model of this planetary system. Its vitally important for them to know how long the dark will last  they have no power to make artificial lights, and those creatures come out at night  but does Fry or anyone else advance the model along its track to see how long before the suns come up again? Of course not.
When one of the Muslim kids goes missing, the first place it is suggested they look for him is in a building where they have to blast through the locks to get in. Now, the audience knows that the kid found a way inside, but if the characters in the film didnt know about that other way in, and thought the place was inaccessible, why would they look there first for him? How do they think the kid got in?
I could go on and on with the list of character idiocies, but the truly offensive thing about Pitch Black is the fact that Riddick  remember, the psycho killer?  is the hero here. This is a man who obviously enjoys threatening everyone around him. He is not someone who committed a murder, say, in self-defense or even inadvertently in commission of another crime, like a robbery, and thats why he was in custody. This is a man who gets off on the fear he instills in the rest of the movies characters. And his menacing is played for laughs. He taunts Johns, thrusting a gun in the other mans face, and cracks a catchphrase-style joke. When the teenage passenger starts to emulate Riddick, shaving his head like Riddicks and sporting the same sunglasses, this is meant to be an appropriate, and humorous, homage to a killer. And lest we be tempted to try to find something to soften Riddick as a character, to try to make him more palatable, Pitch Blacks posters and advertising remind us to Fight Evil with Evil. And this is the character were supposed to cheer on. I cant remember when this kind of positioning of a character in a film made me this angry.
If Pitch Black has anything going for it, apart from the opener, its that its beautifully shot, at least in the scenes before the suns go down. Sure, it looks like one long Nike commercial, and no, a blue sun would no more make everything take on a bluish tinge than our yellow sun makes everything look yellow, but so what? It looks cool. So, in the words of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxys Zaphod Beeblebrox, Pitch Black gets ten out of ten for style , but minus several million for good taste.",JSA_Doc8_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
198,JSA_Doc9_PitchBlack,"When a spaceship crash-lands on a planet of three suns that is plagued by darkness as a solar eclipse hits, the survivors must fight the nocturnal batlike alien creatures. These aliens avoid the light and strike when its dark. The survivors include a dangerous murderer serving a life sentence in maximum security, Riddick (Diesel), who has surgically implanted eyes that shine enabling him to have night vision. He also has awesome muscles that are pumped for action. He wore specially fitted contact lenses to give him that shine job look.
The survivors include: Riddick, who is in chains as he is being transported to another prison; the cruel guard, Johns (Cole Hauser), who it turns out has a few flaws in his personality  which include a morphine habit; and, the spacecrafts landing pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), who becomes the captain when its discovered that the captains throat had been slashed. These two leaders of the plan to get off the dark planet, Johns and Fry, argue all the time, and trust among the survivors becomes the issue. Fry had her moment of cowardice when landing the plane, as she almost panicked and pulled the cord to eject the passengers. This is something Johns uses against her. The other survivors include: a preachy Muslim imam, a holy man, talking up a storm about God; a prissy English antiquities dealer whose wine collection is used as lighting fuel to get them off this darkened wasteland. And a boy called Jack who turns out to be a girl named Jackie, as discovered through the efforts of Riddicks nose for sniffing out female hormones.
This sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography, as it was filmed in the Australian Outback, and also for its innovative editing cuts. The story line left me gasping for more light and the acting left me in the dark searching for one line of dialogue that wasnt shrill or trite. No actor was provided with a challenging part, but Diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate his scenes. He comes to say one-liners such as: They did not know who they were f*cking with! He says this to the dead aliens after he puts them out of their misery, but he might as well have spoken it to a sleeping audience.
The writer/director David Twohy (The Arrival) tries to bring some intelligence to the story, but the script is too shallow and predictable. The characters ranged from a shrill Radha to a cartoonlike Diesel. It is easy to root for the aliens to possibly, against all odds for such formulaic films, pick off all the survivors of the spacecraft. But three do survive and, in my opinion, thats three too many! This film didnt have a clue about what point it wanted to make. It was particularly unclear how good or bad they wanted to portray Diesels character, as he kept changing from bad to good guy at every alien sighting. By the films end I had an empty feeling, knowing I saw another special effect sci-fi film that couldnt bring on a story.",JSA_Doc9_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
199,JSA_Doc10_PitchBlack,"Sometimes, you have to take a movie at face value. They can't all be Casablanca and, shocking as it may sound, not every filmmaker is a genius. Occasionally, we the audience must put our principles aside in order to enjoy the modest pleasures of a given flick. To do otherwise flirts dangerously with art-house snobbiness. If we can lower our sights, however, we may end up enjoying ourselves far more than we have any right to -- turning an otherwise forgettable piece of tripe into a genuinely good time.
Case in point: Pitch Black, a small sci-fi film that bears an unsettling resemblance to a much bigger one. The similarities to Alien are obvious to even a cursory glance, and the plot follows the same pattern as a dozen other cheap knock-offs -- an eclectic group of people, trapped in a colorful locale while inhuman monsters hunt them down one by one. This isn't just well-worn territory; it's scraped down to the bedrock. But Pitch Black resolutely sets out to make the most of this old chestnut, and -- wonder of wonders -- actually manages to pull something off.
The future. Somewhere in the depths of space, a long-distance transport crashes on a barren world. The survivors find themselves blasted beneath the light of three suns, low on food and supplies, and stalked by one of their own: a convicted killer (Vin Diesel) en route to some prison hell-hole. But the worst is yet to come -- a race of giant fanged nasties lurking in a series of nearby catacombs. Thankfully, the monsters hate the light, and on a planet with three suns, there's never any night. It would take a total eclipse to set them loose on the surface...
As I said, the premise is hardly original. But director David Twohy and a talented cast and crew elevate the material beyond its modest beginnings. Twohy and cinematographer David Eggby have taken some interesting steps to make their alien world appear...well, alien. Not through CGI imagery or run-of-the-mill special effects, but from more old-fashioned techniques, such as lighting and film stock. The movie has a grainy, high contrast look that leaves a strong impression. The light appears brighter, while the air has a harsher quality than Earth's. We're never allowed to forget that there are three suns in the sky, or that the nearby planets move differently than ours. Most sci-fi worlds look uncomfortably like Burbank; this one evokes an alien landscape the way few ever have.
With that as a back-drop, Twohy keeps the action taunt and intense. While special effects are in abundance, he relies more on character interaction and plot twists to drive the story. It's tough not to jump in places or to get a few goosebumps, even though you know who's going down and when.
The characters, too, are more than just cardboard cut-outs, with enough interesting aspects to keep us interested. Radha Mitchell's tough-talking female pilot has all the signs of a Sigourney Weaver clone, but does things that few heroes get a chance to -- like make mistakes or think selfishly. Old pro Keith David makes the most of a limited role, turning his Muslim cleric into the film's moral center. But the true star is Diesel, playing a predator in the midst of his fellow sheep. We never know whether to trust him or not -- at times he appears benevolent, even compassionate, but his vicious nature is never far from sight. Diesel balances his rough charisma with his character's menacing aspects to create a terse, fascinating lead. You're not sure if you like this guy, but you never tire of watching him.
The commercials are calling Pitch Black the best sci-fi film in years, which is overstating the case just a bit. No one's going to place this movie in the annals of immortality. But sometimes, it's enough simply to care about your material -- to give that extra boost that lifts it above mediocrity. Pitch Black may be another Alien rip-off, but it's a rip-off with class, style and a lot of heart. For most of us, that's more than enough.",JSA_Doc10_PitchBlack,Jeremy Savill,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
0,GGS_Doc1_Taken,"Liam Neeson flashes a telltale Harrison Ford smirk a couple of times near the start of Taken, which helps explain why this bracingly effective thriller is getting the January cast-off treatment. The film has already been released almost everywhere else but North America  it first opened in France last February  and the major critical knock is that it looks like something Ford would have done 20 years ago. Something like Frantic, in fact, the 1988 movie in which Ford's character rousts Paris in search of his kidnapped wife. The comparisons are apt  Neeson's character rips through Paris for his kidnapped daughter  but you'll miss out on a good movie if you consider Taken just another January dumping. It's more of a thumping, as Neeson lays bare his action-hero chops. The quiet Irishman doesn't often get a chance to go on an extended tear, but when he does, you need to sit back and watch in amazement.  He's ex-CIA ""preventer"" Bryan Mills, who has recently moved to Los Angeles from Virginia to be more of a dad to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). His dedication to his job cost him his marriage to Kim's mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and he's trying to make up for parental lost time. Lenore isn't buying it, and she's now happily involved with a tycoon (Xander Berkeley) who is so determined to spoil Kim, he even buys her a pony. It does seem that Bryan is having trouble leaving the rough life behind: he busts a few moves, and heads, while on a freelance protection job for a pop diva (Holly Valance). Bryan's knuckles and pistols more than come in handy, though, when Kim and her pal Amanda (Katie Cassidy) travel to Paris on vacation, against Bryan's better judgment, and are immediately kidnapped. Bryan learns from his former CIA pals that the girls have been snatched by Albanian pimps, who seek slave prostitutes, and there's a window of no more than 96 hours before the teens disappear into the underworld forever. A ticking clock within a thriller usually means a bomb is about to go off, and that accurately describes Bryan. To say that he hits the ground running is almost an insult to physics. He is the Tasmanian Devil of trackers. Do not doubt him when he calmly tells the kidnappers, via Kim's purloined cellphone, ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" The bodies stack up like jets at a busy airport as Bryan gets down to brutal business, improvising as he goes. Neeson has a marvellously expressive face that contains rage like a bottled tornado. He also conveys the empathy needed for us to endure lots of violence and unfortunate ethnic stereotypes (Arabs are particularly maligned) of this blunt instrument of a film. Who couldn't identify with a father's determination to save his daughter? Taken is from Luc Besson's genre factory, which explains why France got it first and why it bristles with energy. It also reveals the lineage of Pierre Morel, who capably directed, and Robert Mark Kamen, who co-wrote with Besson. Morel has been the cinematographer for Besson's high-octane The Transporter franchise, and Kamen is Besson's favoured screenwriting partner. The film's frenetic pace, which really picks up when the action moves to Paris, keeps us from thinking too much about things such as why the Parisian cops ignore Bryan's habit of driving the wrong way on one-way streets. The only gendarme who really pays attention to Bryan, not always for the better, is his old French intelligence comrade Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin). The choice of Neeson for the lead elevates the material. Time was when Neeson was considered for the role of James Bond. He would have made good use of the proverbial licence to kill, although 007's lady-killing antics might have been a stretch. He would also have made a dandy Jason Bourne. At the ripe old age of 56, Neeson retains the physical attributes to arm-wrestle Matt Damon for the role, along with the actor's grace to make us want him to do just that.",GGS_Doc1_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Positive,Taken
1,GGS_Doc2_Taken,"Maybe I was just in a really good mood when I saw it. But I found Taken to be an absolutely great movie. It is unquestionably a trashy action movie of no particular aesthetic merit, a shallow pleasure at best. But oh, how very pleasurable it is. The movie stars Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA agent who has retired and moved to Los Angeles to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), a 17-year-old living the customary life of a spoiled brat with her indulgent mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) and wealthy stepdad Stuart (Xander Berkeley). One such indulgence is a trip to Europe to follow U2 for a month-long tour, something Bryan finds questionable in the extreme, but he allows himself to be guilted into it, though not without arming Kim with a laundry-list of guidelines to follow. Bryan's paranoia turns out to be quite well-placed; Kim and her BFF Amanda (Katie Cassidy) have hardly been in Paris half an hour when a group of thugs break into the empty apartment where they're staying, kidnapping them to press them into service as drugged-out prostitutes. Luckily for the girls, not so much for the kidnappers, Kim has her dad on the phone when this all happens, and he hears just enough to have a good idea of where to start looking for the kidnappers. Not to mention that it gives him the opportunity to issue a threat that you might have heard in the trailer, and might have read on the poster, but it's such a goddamn brilliant bit of purple prose, delivered by Neeson in such a terrifying purr, that I find myself anxious to repeat it in full: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" It's off to the races from that point on, and your ability to enjoy Taken whatsoever is largely going to be a function of your ability to turn off the parts of your brain that control suspension of disbelief and morality, and settle in for an hour of an enraged papa bear roaring his way through Paris en route to exacting bloody revenge on the men who took his little girl. The film is a glossy slab of empty calories that represents one of the highest recent peaks of a very particular film discipline: this is a Luc Besson Production, with all the magnificent badassery that phrase promises but only sometimes delivers. Written by Besson and his frequent partner Robert Mark Kamen, it's hardly the film's scenario that sets it apart from hundreds of other projects. The two men most responsible for elevating Taken from the status of trash to exorbitantly entertaining trash are Neeson and director Pierre Morel, whose single previous directorial credit, also for Besson, was District B13. That earlier film struck me as a series of some of the best action sequences of the 00s strung too-infrequently along a plot that tries to cram far too much social commentary and ""intelligence"" into a film that is appealing largely because of its Big Dumb Action Setpieces. Taken is exactly the solution to District B13's problems; once the action starts, it never stops, and the plot consists of absolutely nothing beyond ""Liam Neeson beats the crap out of anyone between him and his daughter"", there's no convoluted narrative leaps to keep up with. Really, the script has it both ways: opening with a healthy chunk of drama so that we'll have some actual investment in our hero, and thereafter taking that as written, so that the fun doesn't have to stop.

""Fun"" I call it; but it is certainly soulless fun. It is predicated entirely upon the viewer's desire to watch unabated, well-choreographed and well-edited violence (the film certainly ought to please everyone who thought that the Jason Bourne movies and their knock-offs were anarchically cut together). Do note that I'm using ""soulless"" as an adjective, not a judgment; sometimes the best steak in the world isn't going to cut it when you have a taste for a hamburger from the local bar, and that is the proper way to approach Taken. It is junk, but executed with enough flair and energy that it is compulsively watchable anyway. Anyway, I mentioned two men who made Taken so great, and I ought to follow through on that: Liam Neeson. He's capable of being a great actor, but it wouldn't add anything to the film at hand if he put so much energy into it; instead, he suffices for being hugely charismatic. He underplays everything in a film that could easily have tipped into hammy melodrama, and single-handedly restores a sense of coolness that has been largely missing from action movies for many years. Given that Taken is a European production, it doesn't seem amiss to suggest that Neeson's mirthless and harsh performance is mostly similar to the implacable killers in French and Italian action films from the 1960s and '70s. He's a deadly serious figure in a genre that has become more and more silly in the last couple of decades, and it's a refreshing throwback indeed. This kind of highly competent, highly professional action hero is the kind of wish-fulfillment character that makes so many tough-guy pictures such irresistible guilty pleasures; and if that's not praiseworthy in any moral or social sense, well, to that I can only say, ""screw it"". It's rousing and entertaining, and given how few movies actually succeed at such a seemingly modest goal, that's quite enough for me.",GGS_Doc2_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Positive,Taken
2,GGS_Doc3_Taken,"Who knew Liam Neeson, the same highly regarded actor who's made a living starring in such sophisticated and acclaimed films as Schindler's List, Nell, Rob Roy and Kinsey, could be so convincing as a kick-butt-and-take-names-later action hero? We all know that Neeson can act, and act extremely well, but I can't fault anyone for thinking he might be a little out of place in director Pierre Morel's Taken, a fast and furious offspring of the Bourne franchise and the television show 24. It's easy to doubt Neeson's ability to pull off such a role because he's never really done it before (Sorry, but I don't count Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace), and let's be honest here, how many 56-year-old actors can effectively play a tough-as-nails vigilante who can easily take down loads of evil thugs half his age? It is often said you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and fortunately Neeson has made the most of his initial offering to the action genre. In fact, a large part of the appeal of Taken comes from Neeson and the credibility he brings to a film that oftentimes deals with preposterous and unrealistic situations. That's not to take anything away from today's top action stars - Jason Statham, Vin Diesel or Mark Wahlberg, to name a few - but it is very rare that action junkies like myself get to experience watching an actor with the same demanding screen presence and swagger as Neeson. The gravitas and complexity that is provided by Neeson actually ends up adding an extra layer of depth to Taken, and his memorable performance will make you wish he would've considered dabbling with the action genre a whole lot sooner in his career. With that said, it should come as no surprise that he seems right at home playing Bryan Mills, a newly retired CIA operative who left his job and moved to Los Angeles so he could be closer to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, formerly of the television series Lost), much to the chagrin of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and her new, filthy rich husband (Xander Berkeley). Kim may be happy that Bryan wants to be a part of her life, but the thing she wants more than anything is for him to sign a permission slip that will allow her to spend the summer in Paris with her girlfriend. As an overprotective father who has seen the worst the world has to offer, Bryan is reluctant to potentially put his daughter in harm's way, but, after all, he wants to stay on her good side so he eventually caves in to her request. However, daddy apparently knows best because soon after Kim and her friend arrive in the City of Lights, they are abducted by a mysterious bunch of Albanians who are so merciless even the Russians give them a wide berth. But if you think the kidnappers are going to get away with their prized possessions scot-free, you are sorely mistaken. Just before Kim is whisked away against her will, she is able to use her cell phone to provide Bryan with some information about her captors, which proves to be a father's worst nightmare. With some help from his former CIA colleagues, Bryan puts the pieces together and learns his daughter's abductors are a nasty group that kidnaps teenagers, drugs them and sells them off as sex slaves. And to make matters worse, Bryan has a 96-hour window to find Kim or he will likely never see her again. So it's off to Paris for Bryan, and with the particular set of skills he's acquired over a very long career in the shadows, he vows to recover his loving daughter, even if it means tearing down the Eiffel Tower. Taken might move a little slowly in the first 20 minutes or so for some, but once Bryan lands in the foreign country to find his daughter, Morel rarely lets up on the exhilarating, frantic action. You are never going to believe everything you see in a movie like Taken, but Morel paces the action with such rhythm that you'll hardly have time to think about anything else other than cars, bullets and fists flying across the screen. But as amusing as Taken is, the script from Luc Besson (The Professional, The Fifth Element and The Transporter) and Robert Mark Kamen (The Karate Kid and Lethal Weapon 3) is not something you would call cutting-edge. Some of the action scenes do get a little repetitious and those of you who crave violence might be a little disappointed because most of the bloodshed occurs just off-screen. (I hear there will probably be an unrated version of the film released on DVD, so some of you will have to wait a couple month for the experience you were hoping for.) And although Neeson gives it his all as a one-man wrecking crew, the performances from the rest of the cast are rather lackluster. Janssen doesn't have much to do here and Grace, who was phenomenal at playing a spoiled brat in Lost, is entirely unconvincing as a teenager. As you can see, Taken does have a few glaring weaknesses, but there wasn't a minute that went by when I wasn't entertained or glued to my seat. And when I go see a mindless action film, that's the thing I care about most. 3.5 stars (out of 5)",GGS_Doc3_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Positive,Taken
3,GGS_Doc4_Taken,"Takens greatest asset resides within the perfectly cast Liam Neeson and the deliberate build of his fascinatingly merciless character. Rather than jump directly into the advertised plot, the film is careful to explore the anti-heros troubled relationships and hint at the dark past that allows him to transform into the ruthlessly efficient soldier requisite for the task at hand. Halfway through the film, when audiences discover to what extent the protagonist is willing to go to accomplish his mission, its impossible not to be engaged in his brutally unrelenting plight. Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job of long hours and dangerous work in an attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But with a restrictive ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and his naturally overprotective impulses, he finds the young woman drifting further away. Not wanting to compound their strained relationship, Bryan reluctantly permits Kim to vacation in Paris, giving her more freedom than hes comfortable with. Things quickly spiral out of control when shes kidnapped by Albanian slave traders from her hotel room. Now, in a desperate and deadly quest, Bryan will stop at nothing to track down those responsible, to save his daughter from the clutches of a depraved organization. Luc Besson certainly has an obsession with shady men with checkered pasts, forced to delve into disturbing criminal underworlds to seek redemption and vigilante justice. Antiheroes come in many styles, and although some critics may scour at unoriginal aspects of Liam Neesons Bryan, the man still knows how to be a badass. In the rescue of his daughter, he has no limits; this creates many unexpected scenes of exercising an iron will and a frightening determination, which finds a seemingly heroic man donning a guise of villainy. And yet, all of it feels righteous  its a testament to character design when the hero can remain a hero even after viciously torturing criminals or shooting innocent people to force a few quick answers. He may not be entirely unique, but this hardboiled, unflinching preventer is simply fixating. Taken is an action film connoisseurs perfect guilty pleasure. Bubbling over with chase sequences, shootouts (the kind where the baddies supply all the firepower), and fistfights, it takes on a realism not found in many of the action-for-the-sake-of-action flicks of recent years. Bryans hand-to-hand combat skills dont rely on flamboyant or showy martial arts, instead taking a more realistic approach, with plenty of one-hit takedowns and throat-chops that effectively subdue the enemy in a stealthier manner. The authenticity of it all may be negotiable, but its refreshing to see simpler forms of attacking and defending  and its certainly more believable when random gun-toting henchmen arent prepared with perfect kung-fu fighting techniques to combat the specially trained protagonist. Taken prides itself on its serious, dark tone. The villains atrocities are amplified by their detestable trade; they will receive no sympathy from viewers when they get whats coming to them. The hero is also rather remorseless, stopping at literally nothing to find his daughter. But this grimmer mood sets Taken apart from its predecessors, and provides an authenticity lacking from those flashier attempts at sinister action, seen plenty of times before. When the protagonist can electro-shock torture a thug for information, and the audience can applaud him for it, its evident that an intriguing character has been born.",GGS_Doc4_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Positive,Taken
4,GGS_Doc5_Taken,"Taken: Action thriller. Starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Olivier Rabourdin. Directed by Pierre Morel. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) So many movies are well intended but poorly made that when something like ""Taken"" comes along, it's a relief, almost a joy. There's nothing lofty in the intentions of ""Taken."" The aspiration here was to make a simple, straight-ahead action thriller. Period. But if you think that's easy, think of all the lousy action thrillers that come out in the course of a year. The level of skill that went into ""Taken"" is masterly. This is a picture that will appeal mainly to people who love movies, and I use the word ""love"" advisedly. Viewers who love movies for their true soul - for their obviousness, for their manipulations, for their corniness, for their blend of high and low emotion - will take great pleasure in ""Taken."" Others, who like movies conditionally, like a wayward lover they hope to reform, may end up hating ""Taken"" - or at least thinking of it as something stupid, ridiculous, far-fetched and worthless. Which reminds me of a story: When I was 6, all the kids I knew used to watch the TV show ""Batman."" We took it very, very seriously. Then, at around 7, we realized it was ridiculous. Then, when we were around 9, we realized it was intended to be ridiculous, and we liked it again. At 7, we thought we were quite sophisticated, but, it turned out, there were higher levels of appreciation. ""Taken"" requires that higher level of appreciation. In terms of pace and economy, it's beautiful to behold. Director Pierre Morel, working from a script by Robert Mark Kamen (""The Fifth Element"") and Luc Besson, knows when to slow down and lavish time on characters to establish the emotions and motivations that are going to give the action its urgent undercurrent. Liam Neeson plays Brian, a nice, easygoing fellow whose main mission in life, as the film starts, is to rekindle a relationship with his teenage daughter. Apparently, he was a workaholic who neglected his family and wrecked his marriage, but he's determined to keep that one flickering connection alive and thriving. Oh, yes, and it turns out that he's a former CIA agent. Of course he is. What did you think, that this movie was going to be some boring thing about a family? Wake up and smell the explosions! So what happens next? How do the screenwriters connect the dedicated-father angle with the former CIA-agent angle? Three guesses. ... What, you only needed one guess? That's right, the daughter is taken and borne away by an international cabal of criminals. Anyone could devise this premise. The real measure of ""Taken"" is not in what happens but in how it happens. Observe, for example, the intelligent construction of the abduction scene. Notice how the design of the apartment (from which the girl is taken) and the use of the victim's perspective contribute to the tension. Take note of the sheer cleverness of the filmmakers' choosing to have it all happen while the girl is on the phone, and how that phone conversation builds the sense of dread and excitement. It's as if the filmmakers, at every turn of the script, said, ""OK, this is how it's usually done. Let's come up with a way that's better. Then let's throw that out and come up with something that's even better than that."" There are different kinds of creativity. ""Taken"" evinces the creativity of expert craftsmanship. Neeson is well cast as a softhearted, thoughtful, self-effacing man who is big enough to do serious damage once he gets angry. He's angry for most of the movie, which, incidentally, takes place mainly in Paris. The placement of an archetypal American character, the avenging action hero, wreaking havoc through the Paris streets has some dark appeal: No one at the tourist information booth is going to be rude to this guy. Then it's over, and a glance at the watch shows that only 94 minutes have gone by and yet so much has happened. I won't tell you ""Taken"" is great, but it's great fun.",GGS_Doc5_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Positive,Taken
5,GGS_Doc6_Taken,"Taken is the latest film from the French film-maker Luc Besson and is about American, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who turns Paris upside down  Ill tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to!  in his search for his abducted, 17-year-old daughter, Kim, although, personally, I wouldnt have bothered. Kim is so irritating. Kim is so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Bryan, Id have said to him if I could, youre better off without her; so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Now, lets go eat. But doting dads are doting dads, I guess, and there is just no stopping him, which is a shame, as what follows is a big sorry mess of the most clichéed, improbable and xenophobic kind.  Bryan, Id have also said, I am very hungry and if I dont have supper soon I shall faint. I probably wouldnt have fainted  have yet to faint, ever  but I think Id have tried anything, pulled out all the stops. Still, I wouldnt have added that Id tear down the Eiffel Tower if I had to, as thats just silly. The film opens in California; happy, sunny California where you are safe because bad, swarthy foreigners cant get to you. Thats the feeling, anyway, and it is weird, I agree. After all, Besson is French and Neeson is Irish but there you have it. There must just be no accounting for pro-American fervour and sentimentalism sometimes, although an eye on the box office must help. Anyway, we are introduced to Bryan: big, tough Bryan who has retired early so he can live nearer to and get closer to Kimmy, who lives with his ex-wife and her husband, Stuart, a zillionaire. Stuart is always outclassing Bryan. Bryan gives Kim a karaoke machine for her 17th birthday. Stuart gives her a pony. Ouch! That cliché always hurts. And, boy, does Kim squeal excitedly when she sees that pony. Kim, you are already thinking, deserves whatever is coming to her. Bring it on! Lay her out! What is coming to Kim? Well, Kim wants to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, another pampered babe of the flouncing kind, but daddy wont have it. He knows the world and there are bad people out there, he tells Kim. Hells bells, they probably lace the croissants with crack in Paris. Still, he eventually consents with strict warnings about phoning every ten minutes. So Kim and Amanda fly off for what would have been a lovely trip had they not been kidnapped by swarthy, sex-slave traffickers the moment they arrive. Seriously, they dont even get a chance to unpack. Thats how evil Paris is. We know we are in France, by the way, because all the French men carry baguettes, which is always a sign. And they are probably on their way to a game of boules. Anyway, Bryans not having it, obviously, and yet as he snaps so does everything else: narrative logic; characterisation; believability. When Bryan hooks a girl up to an IV drip in his hotel room, were meant to believe he always travels with an IV drip and bag of saline to hand? When voice recognition software identifies not just what country the kidnapper comes from, but also what village, in about ten seconds, we are meant to believe that, too? Aside from brief intervals of moronic plotting, Taken is mostly just hell-for-leather action sequences: car chases; punch-ups; and Bryan being outnumbered ten to one, yet surviving without so much as a bruise or rent in his suit. The bad guys, by the way, would have been from LA if they hadnt been from Albania. I cant account for it, really. Besson, as a writer and director, has been behind some perfectly decent films (La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element) and has also produced quite a number of truly good ones (Nil By Mouth, Tell No One) but this, billed as a taut thriller, is neither taut nor thrilling. Its just nonsense. And as for Neeson, he plays Bryan rather like Daniel Craig as Bond, but without the irony or the Speedos, and we all know how far irony and Speedos can take a film. Truly, this is one to skip. Taken by name but not, alas, by nature, as it doesnt take you anywhere. Forget it.",GGS_Doc6_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Negative,Taken
6,GGS_Doc7_Taken,"You can see that in the way the film portrays Neeson's character and his relationship with his daughter, a 17-year-old princess called Kim, or Kimmy (Maggie Grace). Neeson is Bryan, a retired CIA man. He has moved to Los Angeles to be near her, after his ex-wife has remarried. He feels guilty about all the years he wasn't around. Kim lives with her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen, who's actually Dutch) and Stuart the millionaire (Xander Berkeley). On Kim's 17th birthday, Bryan turns up with a karaoke machine, because she wants to be a singer. Stuart gives her a pony. Her shrieks of delight can be heard in Paris - which is where she wants to go for a holiday with her close friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy), who's a babe. Bryan is dead against it but he consents with strict warnings about phoning every 10 minutes. Naturally, she and Amanda are kidnapped by white slavers as soon as they arrive. The film depicts these Americans as rich and pampered, with no idea of how dark the wider world is - which is odd, given that they live in Los Angeles. Kim is spoiled but innocent, unaware of her father's sacrifices to be near her. Maggie Grace flounces and pouts, playing more like 13 than 17, because the director wants a sense that Kim's American naivete contributes to her misfortune - a fairly ugly idea that's pretty common in European movies about Americans. The film only takes off during the kidnapping. The Californian scenes are slackly directed, full of cliches and dull dialogue. It's as if Morel is bored by all the setting up he must do before the action. Kim is talking to her dad on the phone when the Albanians turn up in the apartment in Paris. Bryan becomes super-efficient and convincingly serious, telling her to do exactly what he says. He plugs the phone into a recorder as the men find his beloved child. It's an agonising scene, in which sound carries most of the horror. When they find her phone, Bryan speaks to one of the bad guys with chilling clarity: ""I don't have any money but what I do have are a particular set of skills, skills that I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you."" He's not kidding. Hell hath no fury like a father in pursuit of his virginal daughter. Chuck Bronson would have loved this part. Taken is basically a modern western in that sense - just like John Ford's 1956 classic The Searchers, in which a man's niece is kidnapped by Comanches; he tracks them until he catches up and then starts killing them. Taken is not worthy to be in the same sentence but I think Besson is remaking The Searchers - only nastier and with more relevance to our times (which means the violence is on-screen, rather than off). And just like John Wayne in The Searchers, Neeson becomes something darker in the pursuit. What made The Searchers so compelling was Wayne's portrayal of how vengeance destroys the vengeful, even as it can push them on for years. There's a sense of that here but it's not seen as a negative for Bryan: this movie is for those who think killing bad guys (and that means terrorists) with extreme prejudice is a good thing. Torture is OK, too. In one scene, one of the Albanians wakes up tied to a chair. Bryan is in front of him, with two spikes in his hands. He plunges these into the man's thighs and attaches wires to the light socket. ""We used to outsource this sort of thing,"" he tells the screaming man, ""but we found some countries had unpredictable power supplies  That's not a problem here in France."" The ideas in great movies have a way of trickling down to baser films, where they turn up with a different meaning. Taken is basically a ""kill-'em-all, let God sort-'em-out"" kind of action movie. It's very efficiently made, very nasty and very Old Testament. The human trafficking trade in Europe is real and horrible but it's apparently not much like what we see here. Taken is more about pest control, exterminating the human cockroaches. Those people, over there.",GGS_Doc7_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Negative,Taken
7,GGS_Doc8_Taken,"If there are any 24 fans who have wondered what the TV series might be like if Liam Neeson replaced Kiefer Sutherland, Taken provides an opportunity to have that question answered. Neeson's Bryan Mills uses nearly all the Jack Bauer tactics, including torture, bone-crunching, and bloodletting. He gets involved in car chases, shootouts, and brings a gun to a knife fight. Like the Energizer Bunny, he takes a licking but keeps on ticking. When it comes to action, Taken gets the job done. The film is never boring. It is, however, completely preposterous. The screenplay, credited to Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, feels like the CliffsNotes version of something longer and more detailed. In order to shoehorn the introduction into a tidy 30-minute package, subtlety is abandoned. There are no transitions, but there's a lot of heavy-handed exposition. The filmmakers' approach is never to use a precision tool when a sledgehammer is available. Credulity isn't high on the list of characteristics they are striving for. The payoff is that once the movie gets going, the ride is enjoyable (if dumb). And one has to accept that, while the ending resolves the film's main storyline, there are countless dangling threads about which we are supposed to forget. The film introduces us to ex-government operative Bryan Mills and wastes little time showing how competent he is in high-pressure situations when, while working as a hired security guard, he saves the life of a pop starlet (Holly Valance). Meanwhile, Bryan is trying to reconnect with his 17-year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), but all she really wants from him is a signature on a permission slip so she can spend a few weeks in Paris. Because he ""knows the world"" to be a dangerous place, he's initially reluctant but, after a few nasty stares and cutting remarks from his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), he agrees. The next time he hears from Kim, she's in danger. A group of men have broken into her Paris residence and are stalking her. Armed with little in the way of concrete information, Bryan heads for Europe with the twin goal of finding his daughter and killing those who kidnapped her. The path leads into a maze that includes police corruption, Albanian organized crime, and sex slave trafficking. On one level, it's refreshing to see people get killed when guns are fired. Hollywood's PG-13 vision is that lots of violence is okay as long at the results of the violence are neutered. It's a little surprising that this movie, with its frank and graphic depictions of torture and unflinching images of death, missed an R. It boggles the mind that the MPAA somehow deemed this appropriate for teenagers but found Slumdog Millionaire too harsh. I feel reasonably sure that five or ten years ago, this cut of Taken would have been rated R. The body count is high - probably at least 20. Jack Bauer would be proud. This is a French film and most of it takes place in Paris, but as is the case for many projects with which Luc Besson is involved, it was made with an international market in mind. Besson likes to believe he can ""out-Hollywood Hollywood."" So, in this case, there's plenty of action, the stars are internationally known, and the dialogue is primarily in English. Despite these factors, 20th Century Fox hasn't thrown its full weight of approval behind Taken - the movie's release date was pushed back several times, and it reached U.S. theaters only after it was already available on DVD in Europe. For Liam Neeson, this is one of those ""paycheck"" roles. He's not required to do much more than look grim and participate in some carefully choreographed action sequences. Maggie Grace, still best known for her doomed role in Lost, has the thankless task of playing the victim. There's no single villain, so a bunch of unknowns play various nefarious individuals who bear some degree of responsibility for what has happened to Kim. Unlike in many action films of this sort, however, there's no individual at the top of the totem pole, so Bryan's goal is to eliminate everyone with any degree of involvement. There's no Payback scenario. Taken has the kind of story that, if fleshed out properly in a novel, might be a page-turner. The perfunctory, contrived manner in which director Pierre Morel handles the material, however, ensures that the movie is never given the opportunity to rise above the level of a cheap potboiler. Like most winter releases, this is one that can be easily bypassed. The well-crafted trailer promises more atmosphere and intelligence than the movie delivers.",GGS_Doc8_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Negative,Taken
8,GGS_Doc9_Taken,"Any parent could relate to Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), the retired super-spy at the center of Taken. All he wants is what's best for Kim, his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace). Divorced from her mother and overshadowed by her filthy-rich stepfather, he would, he says, ``sacrifice anything for her.'' Specifically, he would kill each and every scum he meets in Paris. The number he does on the City of Lights is comparable, corpse-for-corpse, to any damage wreaked by Jason Bourne. With one key difference: Jason has a conscience, or wishes he did. Bryan has none. I mean none. The only life that means anything to him is Kims, and when she gets nabbed by Albanian sex traffickers on a trip abroad, Bryan hops on a plane and lays waste to gay Paree. You cant just run around tearing up Paris! whines a French colleague (Olivier Rabourdin). Au contraire, Bryan says: Ill tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to. Clench-jawed action star is a new gig for Neeson, but the Man Who Was Schindler has long worn the mantle of heroism. The twist this time is an utter lack of moral complexity. Hes a dad, and hes a killing machine, and thats it. This blindered characterization makes for a driving premise and a few interesting scenes, but it gets to be a bore after the shock wears off. If hell kill or maim just about anyone, wheres the suspense? Its less Neesons fault, or even director Pierre Morels, than the movies co-writers: Robert Mark Kamen and the entertainingly shlocky Luc Besson, who also produced. The Besson-Kamen writing team gave us The Fifth Element, all three Transporters and, most recently, a little Norwegian-Mexican comic Western called Bandidas. Theyre just the men for high-gloss knockabout bloodshed. So Bryan shoots people. He knifes them. He snaps their necks, sprays them with hot steam and chases them onto highway ramps where theyre conveniently smooshed by oncoming traffic. He electrocutes a guy for information, then flips on the switch and leaves. He wings a lady whose only crime is cooking him a nice chicken dinner  and being married to the wrong man.The films single most effective scene is the tense trans-Atlantic sequence when Kim, on the phone with her father, sees her airhead friend (Katie Cassidy) abducted in a Parisian flat and realizes the kidnappers are coming for her next. As Bryan instructs his daughter to scream identifying characteristics (height, hair color, tattoos) into her cell, the camera looks squarely at Neesons pale brow and watery blue eyes. He doesnt cry; his face is gripped not by immobilizing grief but by pragmatism, professionalism and the need to act immediately. After he arrives in France, theres a bit of quirk with a fellow hired to translate Albanian. What a nifty touch  hey, Bourne never hired a temp. For a minute there, movie begins to approximate real-world logic. But then Bryan starts arguing with the Albanians in English, and they argue back in English, and at no point does anyone smack himself in the head and say, Duh?! Isnt this France? Bryan doesnt even arouse suspicion when he infiltrates the sex traders kitchen as a faux French agent and proceeds to boss everyone around in Anglais. Generally, scenes begin with Bryan entering a building and end with a tangled splay of bodies. The fight choreography is fast, fatal and nonstop: raw meat for action devotees. But if its unrepentant violence youre after, youre better off renting Morels 2004 collaboration with Besson, District B13. It boasts lots of the same elements (Paris setting, inky crime, corrupt cops and a butt-kicking avenger out to rescue a kidnapped female relative), plus the exhilaration of Parkour chase scenes and the honesty of a hard-R rating. Despite the savagery of its violence, Taken is PG-13. That alone should give a parent cause to worry  especially Bryan.",GGS_Doc9_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Negative,Taken
9,GGS_Doc10_Taken,"Liam Neeson was up forbut never got to playJames Bond, and now hes getting even. In the violent, churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken, hes a suave, power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who, in truth, is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (hes an ex-husband, as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And hes paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a preventer (I prevented bad things from happening) that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regretif he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours hes torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower. First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding: I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you. He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of Frances leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on a luxury yacht on the Seine only minutes before Kim is to be raped by an Arab sheik who looks like Jabba the Hutt. To be generous, its far-fetched to a fault. Worse still, its all been done before. Moving from the theme of vigilante dad (Death Wish), to the strategies of slave traders who traffic girls into prostitution on Internet auctions (Trade), to the tragic spectacle of a scrupulous outsider who slides down the sinkhole of an alternate underworld universe of crime, decadence and perversion (Paul Schraders Hardcore), this hack job has not a shred of originality. Liam Neeson is an unconventional choice to play an action hero. His big, wrinkled smile is at dismaying odds with the lurid mayhem that surrounds him, and how does a brawny American C.I.A. operative account for that lyrical Irish accent? In the end, nobody is called to task for the bodies that litter the streets of Paris, the automobiles and real estate that lie in rubbish left behind or the heroin injections that have mysteriously worn off, leaving Kim heading home to a career as a rock star. Taken is the kind of exploitative junk everyone expects from no-talent French hack Luc Besson, who made the dreadful Transporter films, although this time out hes only the producer and the co-writer of the moronic script, leaving the ossified direction to Pierre Morel. After this horror, you might think twice about sending a teenager to Paris without a chaperone, but it could be worse. She might end up in a movie like Taken.",GGS_Doc10_Taken,Gavyn Gallagher,Action,Negative,Taken
80,MGB_Doc1_Inception,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before. Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level. Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability. Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years. Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned). Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own. Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year. Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether. There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people. Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.",MGB_Doc1_Inception,MGB,Action,Positive,Inception
81,MGB_Doc2_Inception,"Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them.

The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity.

Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.

82,MGB_Doc3_Inception,"Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.

Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say ""Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that."". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with ""Avatar"". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.

I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first ""Matrix"", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like ""Kindergarden Cop"". No disrespect to ""The Matrix"" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.

And that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in ""Memento"", and you certainly see it in action with ""The Prestige""......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.

But that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.

And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.

Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen.",MGB_Doc3_Inception,MGB,Action,Positive,Inception
83,MGB_Doc4_Inception,"Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.

Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time

Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works.

Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.

Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.

But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues.

Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.",MGB_Doc4_Inception,MGB,Action,Positive,Inception
84,MGB_Doc5_Inception,"Inception is a movie that works outside our logic. We feel like our mind had been played all along, it's like the movie contains some puzzling, undeciphered codes scattered all over places. The moment we walk out theater, our mind process the movie, we interpret things, looking for many many possibility of answers over the questions we've just experienced. And this is why Inception works outside our logic; because no matter how hard we think and discuss this movie, we won't go anywhere. It's a decent analogy of a tricky labyrinth.

Like a discourse that some elements - I would say some key - had gone missing, or simply were not even there at the first place, Inception is a piece that Christopher Nolan as a director creates and how he wanted it to be: To create questions in our head. While I think these questions aren't supposed to be vital, but this makes Inception special on a very intriguing level.

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who works with stealing another person's mind. He used a special method by letting himself into a person's dream, hence explored those dreams while in the same time took a very important information that those persons won't share to any one. Once, a billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe), whom supposed to be his victim, offered Cobb a very interesting idea about doing his work differently. Instead of stealing thoughts, Saito asked Cobb to plant idea, to incept something in a person's mind. The logic is - according to this movie - if it's possible to stole any thought, it would also be possible to embed a whole new idea into a person's subconscious.

To make it all happen, Cobb needs to recruit a bunch of people with their specialty. There're Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt); a guy who always worked with Cobb all the time, Adriane (Ellen Page); a brilliant architecture student whom able to create dream's environment, Yusuf (Dileep Rao); a chemist whose drugs are able to provide a powerful sedative, and Eames (Tom Hardy); a forger who stands like an actor on every person's dream. These experts has one objective: to incept an idea into one mind: Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy).

The film rolls with how these experts trying to deliver this inception. Later on the movie, we would have a perception about how complex and intricate this inception method is, and how dangerous a dream could be. Apparently Cobb is keeping a dark thought on his deepest subconscious, this one includes Cobb's two children and his former beautiful wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard). Mal has been disturbing Cobb's mind, it's almost impossible to get rid of her from his dream. Every time Mal appears, his work and life are in a great danger.

Without giving too many spoilers, I would continue my review concentrating on how I perceive Inception holistically. Inception goes in a way that it looks very complicated and confusing, and it'll makes us believe that we have to think hard in order to understand anything this movie delivered. While the truth is, in my opinion, Inception is a complex-looking movie with a very simple concept underneath it. The movie looks very confusing at some point, and then later on it'd become clearer, and then it looked like it's very surprising and mind blowing at the ending scene, it's something that Nolan creates on purpose so the audience would think like they'd been mind-tricked.

And that preceding paragraph would come to my early statement: Inception works outside our logic. No matter how 'ambiguous' the ending is, no matter how detail the script looks like, we as an audience simply won't solve this puzzle because Nolan won't let us do so. It's impossible to conclude a research if we miss some data, so to speak. I'm not implying that Inception is a waste of time, or saying that this is a movie that doesn't have a true meaning. On a contrary, Inception is a work of genius. Instead of making a movie that goes over every one head, Christopher Nolan produced something simple that would be taken very seriously with the audience.

I believe, on the first 30 minutes of Inception, lots of people are trying too hard not to get lost. While the story is going to automatically solve its puzzles on the next two hours, we as the audience is preparing ourselves hard to understand it. Once the ending came, the movie ended, we felt satisfied and intrigued. We felt smarter. We opened our interpretations, threw some insights and reasons, while the truth is actually been there all the time. I myself don't count the ending as ambiguous, since to be ambiguous the story needs to support its ambiguity. And in my opinion, while there are hints here and there, it's not enough to make it ambiguous.

We don't need an extra intelligence to understand this movie. What we need is to relax, throw away our preconceptions, and let the next two and half hours entertaining you on its own tricky way.",MGB_Doc5_Inception,MGB,Action,Positive,Inception
85,MGB_Doc6_Inception,"Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren't so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?

DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he's the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.

If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues.

Plotwise though,it's all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope.

Understand it could've been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.

All scenes involving her are superb,it's a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who's most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.

Several actors could just've switched names,their characters don't have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what's happening at the moment, that's it.

When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths alá Red Eye then see him as a blank page.

Inception's the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you're not allowed to break and examine. It's only when it's over you realize you were standing still all along.

You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.

Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film's eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?

1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and ""violence"" going on here, considering everyone's sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would've been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well.

Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement.

2. Limbo. Wouldn't a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn't it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs.

3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It's getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.

4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever.

Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.

He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So...

No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words""Smart,thought-provoking thriller"" puts Inception next door to them.

The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad.

A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation.

DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.

The rest could've been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...

Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow.",MGB_Doc6_Inception,MGB,Action,Negative,Inception
86,MGB_Doc7_Inception,"You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.

Further on this:

Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.

Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.

The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.

Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.

Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.

The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.

Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.

It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.

But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.

Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.

Spoilers.

The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.

The ""learning about the dream world"" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page's characters already knew what was being explained. The similar ""learning about the matrix"" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.

There's another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That's it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad!

Let's not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor's bath mat. Come on.

The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don't need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.

If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught?

A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.

Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a ""physical"" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn't even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo's goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn't even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He's separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn't happen.

In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he's crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.

Leo's lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a 'so what?' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn't send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It's integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That's why I don't believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.

Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else's dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.

Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.

PS: The 'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It's getting as bad as that tired old 'It's all a dream' scenario. Oh, wait...",MGB_Doc8_Inception,MGB,Action,Negative,Inception
88,MGB_Doc9_Inception,"After reading all the amazing reviews and seeing a score of 9.3...3rd best movie of all time, I had to go watch Inception. Also I really like Memento...it was such a cool, original movie..so I was looking forward to this.

I went to see this movie last weekend. It was an 11:00pm showing on Sunday night, 3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed! We had to sit in the second row...something I don't mind at all.

Epic Fail The movie is about corporate (not even government) spies, that enter people's dreams through some unexplained technology. Once in the dream, they trick the victim into giving up his/her secrets. Pretty simple premise, and one that can be taken into many directions (after all we're in dreamland). Well the direction is down the crapper.

The whole premise of the movie is so shallow, Saito, a corporate CEO hires Cobb (Leo) to go into another CEO's dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire (upon his father's death), so that Saito can have a monopoly. How's that for a story?? What a joke.

Well the movie starts slow and drags on and on, besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens..like they manipulate the victim by having a dream, within a dream, within a dream. When you are falling in the first dream, the second layer has no gravity, but the third and forth layer has gravity?? WHAAAA??? Also even though you are in a dream, you have no super powers..you use boring guns? How about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what?? BOOORRING.

To add to the boredom, Cobb's wife Mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming. And appears regularly to bore us to death, you get the sense that she's supposed to be evil, but it never pans out.

This was interesting on one level only...there was no antagonist. But then again there was no love interest either, and on top of that no danger, cause if you get killed in a dream, all you do is wake up.

This movie is amoral tripe with no imagination..eg. you are in a dream world, instead of driving around in a VAN, why not fly? Instead of shooting guns, why not freeze them in their tracks? Also, there are many people (I assume teenagers) who are saying how original this movie is. The Dream within a Dream thing has been done before...it's called ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors""..also don't EVER compare this tripe to the ""Matrix"". Matrix was original, it was filled with clever allegory, it was truly awe inspiring, but there was NOTHING clever about Inceptipon.

The climax was okay, but just because after 2 hours I couldn't wait to get out of there.

Now the anti-climax, is an entirely different animal, like the viewer hasn't been insulted enough...we are left to ponder weather it was ""all a dream"" (again not very original). The answer is yes, it was all a dream, and Cobb is still in a dream..his kids look exactly the same, even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams.

Please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage. So far the best movie this summer has been Predators...how sad. People think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers..it probably is clever and original to them, but any adult will find this movie dull and boring.

Inception = Fail

IMDb for having Inception in your top 3 movies = EPIC FAIL.

If I was the credibility Nazi, I'd say to IMDb ""NO CREDIBILITY FOR YOU!""

2/10 for exploiting a big budget.",MGB_Doc9_Inception,MGB,Action,Negative,Inception
89,MGB_Doc10_Inception,"A shame that this movie is rated so highly on IMDb. Let me tell you this, this movie is NOT a masterpiece and doesn't even deserved to be among the top 250 of the best movie of all time. A true masterpiece has to be flawless and this movie is worth at most 5.8, no more. The neuro-nonsense that follow suit from a scientific and a philosophical point of view, Inception doesn't make any sense at all...Inception must start with a self-consistent theory of how the human brain works. What is a memory? What is a dream? Because most of us human beings walk around with only very fuzzy answers to these questions, filmmakers are able to take rather outlandish positions on them without arousing any hackles.In the case of Inception, the unstated premise of dreaming is that one one is asleep, one is inhabiting what essentially amounts to a parallel reality external to the mental state of the dreamer. This premise makes for an admittedly entertaining film, but it is preposterous. Dreaming is an entirely subjective experience; everything is an illusion generated and perceived by the brain itself. You can no more ""enter"" someone else's dream than you can enter into a movie that's playing on the multiplex screen.If you ""wake up"" from a dream and realize that you're still dreaming, you haven't entered a different level of some dream-reality continuum -- you've just experienced another illusory sensation. Contrary to the premise of the film, there is no ""architecture"" of a dream. We may feel like we're inhabiting an elaborate, detailed and consistent landscape, but that's just part of the illusion. There are some ideas about dreaming in the film that are actually accurate. For instance, it's true that they are powerfully influenced by emotion and subconscious cognition. And we often do wake ourselves with a powerful muscle spasm, which sleep researchers call a ""hypnic jerk."" But the movie also trades in ideas that amount to little more than folklore. It toys with the old idea that if you die in your dream, you will also die in real life.In the movie, if you die in your dream, you will enter a kind of coma. For obvious reasons, there is no evidence for bangungut-like phenomena, or rather any evidence has gone with the dreamers to their graves.What about the idea that time slows down within a dream, that an elaborate sequence of events in dream-space can take place in a few seconds of real time? As it happens, this claim has been investigated by researchers exploring lucid dreaming, and the results indicate that if there is any such effect, it is fairly small. Okay, but does any of this matter? Scientific error is rife in popular entertainment.I'm prepared to argue that Inception's misconceptions are both symptomatic and enabling of a damaging confusion that is rife in American society: namely, that between the internal subjective reality within our minds and the external, universally accessible reality of the ""real world."" It is this confusion that give rise to magical thinking and its myriad manifestations, from prayer-healing to ""The Gift"" and mystical notions about near-death experiences.Confusion about the boundary between dream and reality is particularly endemic among the religiously inclined, who often perceive dreams as the source of real-world information. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel, for instance, is located on a spot identified in a dream by the Emperor Constantine's mother, Helena.

The perfect metaphor of this movie would be like this:""I liked it,""""I didn't really understand what was going on, but I liked it.""

A tad overrated movie that need to be drop out of the top 250 movies list of all time. I'll give him 2 stars for the CGI effects who were indeed well done. That is all.",MGB_Doc10_Inception,MGB,Action,Negative,Inception
