Both were fathered by Luc Besson, but ""Taken"" is a fast-paced, high-octane action movie that, unlike its younger sibling, has the decency to take itself seriously.Xander Berkeley), a billionaire hoping to replace Bryan in Kim's heart. Bryan is the kind of overbearing dad who wants you to call when you get to the theater, when the movie starts, when the movie ends and as you're pulling off the highway on the way home, just to make sure nothing has gone wrong. Against his better judgment - and in the hopes of endearing himself to his daughter - he signs off on her going to France for the summer, driving her to the airport with advice about where in France is safe and always to look out for trouble.This is what we call foreshadowing. Once Kim gets to France, the fun begins. Kidnapped by a cartel of Albanian human traffickers, she's destined for a life of prostitution and drug addiction unless her father can track her down in 96 hours, before she disappears for good. Here, Bryan switches into Jason Bourne mode - he's an expert at hand-to-hand combat, weapons usage, interrogation techniques and everything else a superspy needs to know to get the job done. Featuring some pretty graphic action sequences (as well as a harsh interrogation involving electricity, a metal chair and a bad guy with information to disgorge) ""Taken"" pushes the boundaries of its rating. How this movie sneaks in as a PG-13, while ""Slumdog Millionaire"" gets slapped with an R, I'll never understand. Mr. Neeson is fantastic as Bryan, perfectly bringing to life the sort of father every girl hates - at least until she winds up in a spot of trouble and needs someone with a backbone to pull her chestnuts out of the fire. The cadences in his line readings are engaging, as always; his dialogue comes off as almost lyrical. To say nothing of the fight scenes; for a guy entering his late 50s, Mr. Neeson is pretty impressive in the action sequences. He carries himself with an unassuming confidence that you rarely see except from those who actually have been in a scrape or three.The rest of the ""Taken"" cast is nondescript. There's no central villain in the film; Bryan simply disposes of scummy bad guy after scummy bad guy for the film's final 60 minutes. His Parisian counterpart, a former French intelligence officer who now works for the police, is the closest thing to a recurring character in the film's last two acts, and even he barely registers.Miss Grace is good as the bratty, insouciant little girl who wants to see the world and thinks she knows best, while Miss Janssen is woefully underused; she must be on-screen for less than 15 minutes. Director Pierre Morel makes a fine English-language debut with this film; he has a keen sense of timing and understands the necessity of keeping an action-thriller like"
102,AGA_Doc2_Taken,AGA_Doc2_Taken,AGA,Action,Positive,Taken,"Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going. By setting the chase within the ultra-sleazy world of human trafficking, which we secretly hope is just a media creation, but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality, the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isn't present in most revenge films. Liam Neeson's daughter isn't ""Dead"", she's ""Taken"", so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what's going to happen here. The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star, but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here, we're left hoping that he's got a franchise in him. The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films (although, like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen, the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon's antics), but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer. You don't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam's plight here, and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex, ambiguous studies of man's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesn't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beat-downs all over Paris. This film doesn't want you to think. Like Neeson's character quickly realizes, thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts, and for those who miss the era of the lean, mean 85-minute skull-crack fest, Taken will re-conjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff, Seagal, and Van-Damme chomp through a slew of B-Movie terrorists. Having an Oscar-caliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot. Forget about Oscars, plot points, or coherence. This dude's daughter has been kidnapped, and he's a"
103,AGA_Doc3_Taken,AGA_Doc3_Taken,AGA,Action,Positive,Taken,"As you all know I am very rarely wrong(note the sarcasm, lol), well this is one of those cases where I was extremely wrong. When I saw the trailer for the movie Taken, I thought ""Oh, great, another 'surprising and suspenseful' thriller that will I'm sure be the ending we never saw coming"", after all I've seen way too many of those movies. But after so many positive reviews of this movie I decided to go ahead and give it a fair shot. I adore Liam Neeson, but when I heard the role that he took as a deadly agent that you don't wanna mess with, I was in question. I tell you, this movie took me by complete and total surprise, this was a great movie. The story is something that we've seen a million times before, but what made this movie more special then the others are the fantastic performances and script that made this into an exciting and intense thriller. Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative from their elite Special Activities Division. He describes his former job as being a ""preventer,"" but has recently retired in Los Angeles solely in order to be close to his 17-year-old daughter Kim who now lives with his ex-wife Lenore and her new wealthy husband Stuart. Mills discovers that Kim wants to take a holiday trip to Paris, with her friend Amanda. Despite his initial concerns about the trip, Mills allows her to go, later discovering that their actual plan is to travel around Europe following the band U2. Arriving at the Paris airport, Kim and Amanda meet a Frenchman named Peter, who offers to share a taxi with them to their apartment. When they arrive, Amanda reveals to Peter that she and Kim are unsupervised, because her family is in Spain. Peter invites the two girls to a party; Kim is reluctant, but Amanda, who is sexually attracted to Peter, hastily agrees. In the house, Kim receives a phone call from her father, which she answers in the bathroom. From the bathroom window, she sees men entering the main room and abducting Amanda. Mills is able to gain critical information about the kidnappers in the final moments after Kim is kidnapped by telling her to shout out everything about them that she notices. Briefly, Mills talks to one of the kidnappers, warning him that unless Kim is released, he will pursue him and kill him. Seriously, I'm so glad that I was wrong about this movie, I couldn't tell you how many times I had my hands over my face or cheered or screamed during this movie, it was so exciting. Liam Neeson, I couldn't believe how scary he was, I've seen him in tough guy roles before but just the delivery of the line ""I will find you and kill you"" was delivered so perfectly, just calm, cold and confident. I just loved how the bad guy said ""good luck"", yeah, he wasn't as confident when Liam popped"
104,AGA_Doc4_Taken,AGA_Doc4_Taken,AGA,Action,Positive,Taken,"The latest rescue-slash-revenge film to hit our screens, Taken, tries to walk the fine line between the two classic character archetypes - family man and ultimate badass. When the estranged seventeen year old daughter of a former spy (Liam Neeson) is kidnapped while holidaying overseas, her father must call upon his unique skill set in order to rescue her before she becomes lost to the Eastern-European slave trade. Liam Neeson kicking ass, and the potential of Maggie Grace showing a little - Taken had my full and undivided attention. As with the majority of films that limp onto the silver screen these days, everything seems to be a remake of a remake, or at the very least, a rehash of a tired idea. What separates a stock-standard retelling, from something that will stay with you longer than a half-masticated corn kernel stuck in your teeth, will almost certainly come down to the execution. Take a well-worn concept, freshen it up a little, but ultimately pull it off with dedication and skill. While Taken is by no means perfect, it is a prime example of a well-executed retelling. Let's face it, the concept of a tough guys daughter getting kidnapped, and having said tough guy track her down, defeating a million bad guys in the process is hardly anything new. It's basically the plot of Commando, or a dozen similar films for that matter. What Taken does well is to play on this tried-and-true formula; it adds depth to the usual one-dimensional characters, and mixes it up in a giant cocktail shaker with stylistic elements that made films like The Bourne Identity such crowd-pleasers. Our first encounter with former spy, Bryan, is less than exhilarating. You'd almost expect to see some incredible action set piece from his pre-retirement days, something that adequately introduces our brooding badass' action hero qualifications - negative. What we get is the image of Bryan asleep on the lounge at home, a well-thumbed pamphlet for a karaoke machine on his lap. He's after the perfect gift for his seventeen year old daughter's birthday, and from what we can establish, he's terribly indecisive when it comes to purchasing a present. It's kind of amusing that after less than two minutes of screen time, we've probably already experienced more character development and insight into our main character than we would experience in just about any other similar film. Amusing, and sad. On the surface, Bryan doesn't appear to be that different from you or I, he seemingly has the same faults, shortcomings and fears that we all do. It's not until his daughter is kidnapped that we see an entirely different side of Bryan emerge. Following on from the initial character development, the film moves quickly onto the search for Kim, Bryan's daughter. With Bryan as our guide, we navigate the murky underworld of Paris, our former spy using every trick in his book to find clues of his daughter's whereabouts. Without giving away too much of the story"
105,AGA_Doc5_Taken,AGA_Doc5_Taken,AGA,Action,Positive,Taken,"It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. The film has not been released in the USA yet even though it's been out for months in Europe and Asia. I don't understand why because as the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture. The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite ""Special Activities Division"" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, would tell you everything you have to know: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly. Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save"
106,AGA_Doc6_Taken,AGA_Doc6_Taken,AGA,Action,Negative,Taken,"I've never written a review before, but this movie angered me so much I felt it's my civic duty to protest. The movie is so full of cliches and unrealistic it's unbelievable it was made by adults. Apparently, we're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence, fatherly love, superhuman strength and righteousness. It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8. Here's the plot: a rich, spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery. Luckily, her daddy happens to be a ex-CIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly, kills and tortures them in a blood-curdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil (yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself), toad-like sheik. On his way, daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching. He doesn't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way. Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess, whom Neeson shoots in the arm, because her husband refuses to give him information on St-Claire. (Meanwhile, their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they don't seem to wake up. Yep, totally.) All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson's favor. His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted. (otherwise, how would he know? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who don't have cell-phones, which would be too boring). Also, she's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first, so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away (at which she miraculously succeeds, despite her panic and the struggle she puts up). Also, multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls, but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside. Well, thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly; otherwise, the movie would have ended there. Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians. Apparently, the PRINCIPLE of sex slavery doesn't concern him, just the fact that it happens to HIS daughter. In the end, Neeson returns with his daughter to America, with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavily-armed men. Also, he has no trouble leaving France after killing each and every one of them. (France must be a Third World country). Everyone is happy and his ex-wife has to admit he's not such a loser after all. Every Freudian fascination has been satisfied trice over. This"
107,AGA_Doc7_Taken,AGA_Doc7_Taken,AGA,Action,Negative,Taken,"To save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it, here is a brief summary: This film is the worst film I have ever seen. This film is atrocious. This film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers, directors, producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity.In the first chapter of this film, three facts are established:1. There exists a man. He's pretty tough. 2. He loves his daughter very much. 3. Aforementioned daughter is going to Paris In order to establish these three facts, which any competent writer or director could do in about ten minutes, the film takes over half an hour, quite possibly the most laborious half an hour in cinematic history. As soon as the daughter reaches Paris, she is of course kidnapped. Literally AS SOON. So there is a sudden escalation in pace that doesn't leave the watcher thinking ""WOW, I didn't see that coming"" or ""Wo, what a skillful escalation in pace"" but simply ""OH Jesus Christ SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD THANK GOD THAT SOMETHING FINALLY HAPPENED!"" This sudden plot ""twist"" of course makes the liberal mother and fat, short stereotypically wealthy stepfather look villainous and the absurdly-paranoid-to-the-degree-that-he-should-seek-professional-help father, who believes his daughter is safer in Los Angeles than Paris, becomes the all-knowing hero. And of course the CIA can detect from a tiny and poor-quality voice sample the hometown of any speaker. So we learn that the daughter has been kidnapped by an Albanian gang who intend to sell her into sex slavery. This is of course the point where the film ceases to be just bad and becomes outright immoral: people trafficking with the intent of prostitution is a real and tangible problem in Europe and indeed all over the world (if you want to see an actually worthy film that deals with the issue I suggest ""Eastern Promises"", ""Dirty Pretty Things"" or ""Spare Parts""). Making it the subject of a Hollywood action film in which the American hero overcomes all the odds to rescue his daughter is insulting to those women who have actually been in this situation. Particularly appalling is the scant disregard that our ""hero"" shows for the wellbeing of any of the other women. It left me questioning ""is it supposed to be ironic? morally ambiguous? No, it's just a film that chose a very sensitive and inappropriate subject for a formula-produced action movie. As the film continues we are given more and more ridiculous scenes that insult our intelligence. One particularly stupid oversight comes when the hero walks into a brothel posing as a Parisian police officer and the villains show absolutely no suspicion of his being impostor, despite the fact that he talks exclusively in English. And the most ridiculously appalling scene comes at the very end. The girl is safe as she returns from Paris to Los Angeles. Finally, back in America, where everyone's safe! In spite"
108,AGA_Doc8_Taken,AGA_Doc8_Taken,AGA,Action,Negative,Taken,"""Taken"" finds the daughter of ex-CIA agent Liam Neeson kidnapped in Paris by Albanians and held for sale into the white slave trade, and details Neeson's efforts to save his daughter and her friend. ""Taken"" is a terrible movie. Liam Neeson is a terrible fit for the ""aggrieved parent / former CIA agent / action movie"" genre. When people applauded, I looked at Don and said, loud enough for people to hear, ""You have to be kidding me!"" Some of those near us laughed nervously  after applauding, mind you. The script was literally laughable at many points. I can imagine the screenwriter sitting at home using some sort of iLife-type program ""iHollywood Script"" or some such to assembly this dreck from stock story elements. It is filled with cliche after cliche, often delivered by Neeson without a hint of urgency or passion. His banter with his former CIA colleagues, and his ex-wife and daughter, is, conversely, delivered with obviously false passion and good humor. He reminded me of a super-excited infomercial audience member at points. There are many ""great"" (hint: sarcasm employed here) bits of dialogue throughout the film. I stifled my laughter at several points. Here, however, is the best exchange. Neeson, as ""Bryan Mills,"" meets an old friend from French Internal Security. When he announces his plans to retrieve his kidnapped daughter, his French friend warns him not to ""tear down Paris"" in his pursuit. ""I WILL TEAR DOWN THE EIFFEL TOWER IF I HAVE TO!"" Neeson replies, again almost bloodlessly. Liam Neeson turned in an excellent performance in ""Schindler's List,"" as the morally confused, yet ultimately upright, Oscar Schindler. I thought he was okay in ""The Phantom Menace,"" and I blamed any failures on his part on the directing of George Lucas (who deserves the scorn of the entire world for that series of abortions, plus his destruction of the Indiana Jones series). In ""Taken,"" however, Neeson simply wasn't up to his usual standard. I wonder if this was perhaps a ""paycheck"" movie? All that being said, I enjoyed myself because this entire movie was so ludicrous and laughable. I later told a friend that it should be shown to film students as an example of how not to write a film. Further, I learned some very valuable things: 1. Jeeps cannot be hurt by any man-made weapon. 2. Nor can strung out, incoherent prostitutes lying in the back seat. 3. CIA agents travel with their own medical drips, needles, etc., to help bring addicts down so as to question them. 4. Albanians in France do not notice if, when claiming to be a French agent, you speak to them in slightly-British accented English. 5. You can leave France after committing multiple murders and other felonies with nary a whisper. There are other lessons contained therein, of course, but these are the ones that stood out in my mind."

Taken should NEVER have been made. Now for every reviewer that has liked Taken, let me assure you that you are wrong. Is it that every story has been told in cinema, that we must deal with the same old same old...over and over again?? There was NOTHING original in this film. Luc Besson has proved time and again that he can't write. This is his Citizen Kane! Taken is every action/thriller cliche thrown into one violent shambles. Neeson is a retired agent, who is suffering guilt at a wrecked marriage and at being a bad dad. Yawn. Famke Janssen is the ex-wife. She now is married to a dull rich guy. She rants that Liam was never there for her or the daughter. After spending five minutes with them, you know why! They are horrible! Liam can't compete for the love of his hideous daughter. He buys her a karaoke machine, cos she wants to be a singer! We never get to hear Maggie Grace sing...but then again, we never got to see her act either. New dad buys her a horse, which she rides around her party. Liam takes lots of photos on his throwaway product placement camera...to put in the photo album he keeps of daughters' birthdays. Oh Liam, just don't get all deep and tender and touch the photo...no...NO...he touches the photo!!! Then daughter wants to go to Paris. But really, she's doing all of Europe, following U2! Liam is concerned. The worlds a bad place...and U2 are a bad band! Daughter jets to Paris with airhead blonde girlfriend. They meet an ugly guy with cross eyes. The girls play music really loud and jump around and then the blonde is taken by Albanian human traffickers who were contacted by cross-eyed guy. The daughter phones dad. Then she's 'taken'!There is a fantastic cliched funny scene as Liam jets to Paris. He holds the tape to his ear,listening to the kidnapper saying ""Good luck"". He pushes stop, rewind and listens again...and again. It is a side-splitting moment. Within 5 minutes of Taken, you just wish SOMEONE would whack the daughter! She is an acting vacuum and just really annoying. Aaannyway, Liam chases cross-eyed guy, who gets killed by a truck. He's lucky...he got out of this horror story early! Liam does some researching, hangs out in with an Albanian translator...then some hookers. The translator tells Liam that his daughter is at 'the construction site', which Liam finds immediately, because there is only one construction site in Paris!

How convenient that his ex-CIA buddies talk him into a bodyguard job where he heroically saves a no-name singer from being knifed to death. This allows him to not only prove his manhood and hand-to-hand combat skills, but also get the singer's business card to give to his daughter slash aspiring pop princess (not that she sings at all in the movie). Did I mention she just turned 17 and received of all things a PONY from her rich step-dad at the extravagant birthday party he threw for her? Oh, and she wants to go to Paris with her best friend. just the two of them, and needs her dad's signature on some immigration form. Liam is skeptical about sending his daughter to Paris. But her mom (Liam's ex-wife) wastes no time telling us about how she hated his CIA job and can't believe Liam would be hesitant to send his daughter to Paris unescorted. I mean, what's the worst that could possibly happen to two teenage girls by themselves in Paris? How dare he be so paranoid? After all, they will be staying at her friend's cousin's house in Paris, and like most parents who send their underage daughters to Paris without adult supervision, she didn't call the cousins to ask about the arrangements. And oh, by the way, instead of just staying in Paris, they're going to be traveling all over Europe to see U2 concerts. With that kind of subplot I can't believe U2 didn't take this opportunity to include one of their songs in this movie. Fast forward after a 12-hour flight and the girls arrive completely fresh in Paris. Immediately a young man approaches them and wants to share a cab to save money. How smart of the girls to accept his money-saving offer. Next thing you know, the girls get to the apartment and immediately tell the dude that they're staying there alone. Didn't their parents tell them not to talk to strangers? About this time I start apologizing to my husband about how incredibly stupid this movie is. I even offered to see if we could get our money back. My only hope was that the girl get kidnapped soon so that we could get to some more exciting parts of the movie. Thank goodness the kidnapping scene was minutes away, and I admit that scene got my heart pumping. If only the rest of the movie were that good. Lest we leave any cliches unturned, we now return to Liam. His dialog indicates he's flat broke, but his daughter's step-dad is rich and can send Liam to Paris on a private jet.

111,BCD_Doc1_Barbie,BCD_Doc1_Barbie,BCD,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"Whatever you are expecting Barbie to be, I can promise that the film will subvert your expectations. I thought I had a rather good idea of what Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach would do with this iconic character and the duo managed to surprise me with their script. This film has so much going on from the word go and does not let up until the end credits roll. In all honesty, when I was walking out of the theater with this giant smile on my face, I wondered how I would put my feelings about Barbie into words. For you, dear reader, I am going to do my best to try. Barbie sees the title character (Margot Robbie) suffering an existential crisis out of nowhere. She begins questioning her existence and place in the world. To figure out just who she is, she reluctantly leaves the utopia that is Barbie Land and journeys to the real world with Ken (Ryan Gosling). First and foremost, kudos to this incredible cast. From top to bottom, everyone plays their specific roles wonderfully. The actors playing the Barbies and Kens very much resemble what you would expect their doll counterparts to me. As far as characters in Barbie Land go though, I must admit that outside of Robbie's Barbie and Gosling's Ken, the character that I adored most was not a Barbie or a Ken. That honor goes to Michael Cera's Allan. Talk about a sentence that I never expected to type, but Cera is just an awkward delight in Barbie. I will say that Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie is also a standout and I do not think she has had this much fun outside of her time on Saturday Night Live. When it comes to our main Barbie and Ken, Ryan Gosling is going to get a lot of love and attention for his performance and rightfully so. He brings so much passion and wonder to this role. His Ken is an unpredictable doofus, which in all honesty is what Ken has always been to me. However, what happens when we start to peel back that layer a little bit? It gets pretty interesting to say the least and Gosling is constantly on his game and making you laugh. loud and clear reviews Barbie film movie 2023 greta gerwig ken ryan gosling Margot Robbie's Barbie is such an interesting and complex depiction of the character. Much like she was able to do with Jo March in Little Women (2019), Greta Gerwig, along with her partner and script co-writer Noah Baumbach, gives us the Barbie we expect and then adds new layers to her. This narrative really dives into who Barbie is, what she represents, and the impact that this doll has had on the world throughout her existence. Through the character of Barbie, we also get a coming-of-age tale, which Gerwig is just so blasted good at writing. Barbie experiences so much in this film, especially when it comes to womanhood,"
112,BCD_Doc2_Barbie,BCD_Doc2_Barbie,BCD,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"Over the last few weeks, Barbie has become omnipresent. Brand deals and collaborations abound, and the cast has embarked on what must be a PR tour of Illiadic proportions. Helmed by Greta Gerwig and from a screenplay the Little Women director wrote with her husband, Jewish writer Noah Baumbach, Barbie is based on the Mattel doll created by Jewish toymaker Ruth Handler (nee Moscowitz). It is the first live-action Barbie film after over 40 computer-animated direct-to-video television films that failed to make a splash beyond the children's audience for which they were intended. This latest exploration of the billion-doll franchise has a plethora of Jewish faces behind and in front of the camera. Rhea Perlman plays the doll's creator and Ariana Greenblatt, whose mother is Jewish and father Puerto Rican, stars as a precocious teen who has thrown away her Barbie. Meanwhile, Jewish actress Ana Cruz Kayne plays Barbie Supreme Court Justice and Jewish trans star Hari Nef plays Barbie Doctor. Closer to these shores, Brit Kingsley Ben-Adir is one of the prominent Ken dolls. Despite living in the happiest, pinkest, and blondest place on earth, Barbie (Margot Robbie) has recently developed a serious case of the blues. With her existential crisis leading her to question every aspect of her life, Barbie is advised to seek answers to her current malaise in the Real World. Joined by Ken (Ryan Gosling) on her voyage of discovery, Barbie soon develops more human traits like crying, cellulite, and ennui. Teaming up with Mattel employee Gloria (America Ferrera) and her teenage daughter, Barbie returns to Barbie Land to find that everything isn't quite how she left it. Gerwig and Baumbach have given us the universal hit of the summer and the kind of film one can't help but fall deeply in love with. With a powerful message of LGBTQ inclusion and a strong feminist message at the heart of its storyline, Barbie manages to be both absurd and deadly serious in equal measure. Robbie and Gosling are both truly magnificent, funny and hugely likeable. The film also features a brilliant performance from Ugly Betty star Ferrera, and some unlikely cameos from action star John Cena, pop singer Dua Lipa and Dame Helen Mirren. Meanwhile Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon bring a certain absurdist flair to the proceedings. Tonally, Barbie is mixture of brilliantly timed gags and a call to arms for women and girls everywhere. It is a film that says ""girls who love pink can also be feminists"". The fact that this movie even exists, and with Mattel's blessing, is in itself a miracle. Come on Barbie, let's go party."
113,BCD_Doc3_Barbie,BCD_Doc3_Barbie,BCD,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"At some point long before the film was unveiled to us critics, Greta Gerwig's Barbie became more than just a movie based on one of America's most emblematic pieces of intellectual property. Maybe it kicked off in the wake of oh-so-many memes, or in being pit against another highly-anticipated movie deemed its aesthetic and ideological opposite in a silly box office showdown. Then again, nearly every retailer catering to femmes has jumped on this bandwagon, too, either directly or indirectly. (My inbox and Insta feed are currently flooded with weeks' worth of shameless promos for blazing hot pink and fluorescent items I'll never wear; even my local barre studio is getting in on the action with a forthcoming Barbie-themed class.) Fans flock to theaters for the 'Barbenheimer' double feature Movies What to know about the 'Barbenheimer' double feature frenzy In any case, Barbie is officially and unequivocally The MomentTM, The VibeTM, The ToyTM so many of us suddenly wish to play with again, even if it's been decades since the last time. It was never going to be just a movie, because Barbie the doll was never ""just a doll""; its creator Ruth Handler had grand ambitions for this free-spirited plastic woman, ones which, famously, haven't always aligned with the public's perceptions. Gerwig's offbeat technicolor fantasy (co-written with her partner, Noah Baumbach) builds upon this historic push-and-pull to imagine a more harmonious ideological relationship between the brand and the consumer of today. That doesn't make the movie's existence as a corporate propaganda piece any less fraught  Mattel Films is a producer  but to its credit, Barbie is eager to at least try confronting its own conundrums. And let's be real: sometimes, corporate propaganda can be fun as hell. Cleverly riffing on the ""dawn of man"" sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the opening scene positions its product as the ultimate game changer in the doll universe, expanding the playtime horizon for young girls beyond the maternal default. The film's cheeky unseen narrator voiced by Helen Mirren channels the ghost of Handler (and, perhaps, Chaka Khan) by noting Barbie can be anyone and everyone: a doctor (Hari Nef), an author (Alexandra Shipp), a president (Issa Rae), brunette, Black, and so on. After months of marketing, memes, and a sense of momentousness, we unboxed the Barbie movie: It is both a delight and at times, too much. Warner Bros. Pictures Her symbolic malleability and ambition have led to a sort-of utopia called Barbie Land, where every version of Barbie lives blissfully in their own perfect Dreamhouse. There are many versions of Ken, too, though he's merely ""superfluous,"" an accessory of lesser importance than Barbie's many flashy outfits or prized convertible. Patriarchy? Where? (We'll find out soon enough.) The main Barbie is Stereotypical Barbie, played with verve and bite by Margot Robbie; she spends days at the beach and evenings throwing slumber parties, while awkwardly side-stepping the persistent advances of Ryan Gosling's Ken  ""just Ken""  much to his chagrin."
114,BCD_Doc4_Barbie,BCD_Doc4_Barbie,BCD,Comedy,Positive,Barbie,"Barbie is easily the comedy of the year. One of the funnest and funniest movies ever made, it's also breezily outrageous, starting with a wicked pastiche of 2001: A Space Odyssey's 'Dawn of Man' scene. By refusing to play safe, star and producer Margot Robbie, and writer-director Greta Gerwig, have done themselves proud. The plot boils down to a mission. Barbie (Robbie), has an existential crisis and is forced to leave Barbieland (a sparkly place where cute girls run the world) to discover why her pretty little head has imploded. Her boyfriend, Ken (Ryan Gosling), comes along for the ride and, once in Los Angeles, the pair are astonished to find it's actually hard to be a woman. Most things are beyond our Ken (Gosling excels as this delicious dolt) but he learns fast and what he eventually brings back to Barbieland is a whole lot of Donald Trump/Andrew Tate-style energy. That's right. On his home turf, Ken wages a war on woke and even though this results in much daffiness  ensemble dancing; frantic frisbee throwing; a gallopingly out-of-control horse fetish  the sense of menace is real. Can Barbie, with the help of a savvy mother and daughter (America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt), turn things around? AP That Will Ferrell plays a flesh-and-blood character, (Mattel's opportunistic chief executive), is one of many clues that Gerwig, and her writing partner Noah Baumbach, know they're part of a rich tradition. Ferrell, of course, was the big cheese in 2014 classic The Lego Movie, which was written and directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller who, since then, as writer-producers, have given us Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. All the above movies make peace with corporate empires and the nostalgia industry. Gerwig, basically, is flagging up that she's learnt from the best. (Just as there are umpteen Spider-Mans in the latest super-hero multiverse epic, there are endless Barbies and Kens in the Greta-verse; they all deserve a shout-out, though Rob Brydon's Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken will always have a special place in my heart). This movie isn't afraid to have female characters holding the floor. Though never preachy, it's definitely speech-y  Rhea Perlman, as Barbie's real-life creator Ruth Handler, channels the Wizard of Oz's Glinda to give a memorable pep talk. The awakening experienced by its heroine would surely make the likes of Kate Chopin and Virginia Woolf fist pump the air. But the whole shebang is just as likely to tickle girls and boys who really enjoyed the 2006 cartoon movie Barbie: Mermaidia. So, you are probably wondering why I am heaping all this praise on the film and yet I did not give Barbie a perfect score. The reason for that is simple: While Margot Robbie's Barbie has a beautiful arc that is likely to hit you right in the heart, and Ryan Gosling's Ken has an arc that is not too shabby either, some of the other characters feel undercooked. Their resolutions,"

It's a stunner with so much more on its mind than playing with dolls. Margot Robbie in ""Barbie."" But it also doesn't discount the importance or the fun of the ritual of playing with dolls. This is how young girls learn about the world and create a dreamland of their own making, in their own eyes, before it's corrupted with the ills of the real world, which arrive soon enough. It's a magical place of pretend, where imagination runs wild, pink colors everything and anyone can be anything. And the undisputed queen of this world is Barbie. The queen of ""Barbie"" is Greta Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated director of ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women,"" who here makes a gigantic leap into the realm of studio-driven intellectual property and shows how that doesn't have to equate to an ideological or creative death sentence. Instead, Gerwig takes everything that Barbie has meant to civilization over the last 60-plus years and Trojan Horses it into a lively, eye-poppingly colorful landscape that fits her own creative palette to a T. No one else could have done what she does with ""Barbie,"" and she couldn't have put all of the ideas she gets out here into anything less than the story of the iconic doll and its revolutionary place in the culture. It's a perfect melding of artist and commercial entity. Australian bombshell Margot Robbie is dream casting in the role of Barbie. The two-time Oscar nominee brings weight, spirit and soul to the role, and as her Ken, Ryan Gosling turns in a wily, unbridled, career-best performance. It's almost not fair how much of the movie Gosling steals, and any awards talk that's churned up about his dementedly entertaining turn is well-earned. It's a Barbie world, sure, but Gosling makes sure you never forget his Ken. Ryan Gosling in ""Barbie."" The movie, which was co-written by Gerwig and her partner in crime Noah Baumbach (""Marriage Story,"" among other tales of Gen-X woe) is as high concept as high concept gets. In Barbieland, everything is picture perfect, everyday. Barbie (Robbie) is the main character in a land of Barbies, which also includes a Presidential Barbie (Issa Rae), a Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey), a Mermaid Barbie (pop singer Dua Lipa) and many more. They all live in their Barbie Dream Houses and cruise down to the beach where they're ogled by their Kens, who don't serve any purpose other than to be recognized by their Barbies.

This isn't because it's art, of course, but a vast and impressive marketing operation, bigger even than The Lego Movie (a clear inspiration). And you can't help feeling totally and utterly flattened and killed by it. Right from the opening moments it's clear that Mattel simply gave Greta Gerwig, one of Hollywood's most thoughtful, interesting directors, 110 million  three times her next biggest budget as a director  and said, in the typical style of now, ""You can have whatever you want."" And she's gone absolutely mad in the toy shop: famous faces have been flown in by the planeload. Rob Brydon is there, for 20 seconds, as Sugar Daddy Ken (a real doll invented for the company's 50th anniversary in 2009). Dua Lipa, Marisa Abela, Michael Cera  Helen Mirren is just tossed away on just three or four lines of voiceover. Will Ferrell is playing the same role he's played since The Lego Movie: the evil, real-world chief executive of Mattel. It makes for a stunningly disjointed cast: influencers are parachuted in just so the box can be ticked, including, of course, a trans Barbie. Margot Robbie, a glassy, slightly psychotic actress, is the show's main attraction: ""stereotypical Barbie"", a breathtakingly beautiful, sugar-spun confection. She lives in a Dreamland house where she takes showers without any water and slides directly into a pink Cadillac outside her house. It's a set designer's dream: plastic waters lap the pink shores. If there are any Oscars to be had, and I doubt there are for this gigantic, hot, roiling slop of a film, it'll be for costume, set, hair and make-up. As for the plot, well, it's back-of-the-napkin stuff. Barbie notices changes to her body. She's got cellulite, and her normally perfectly pointed feet have flattened. In a series of rather convoluted jumps we are told she must travel to the real(ish) world to discover the little girl who's doing these things to her. And when she gets there, she's horrified to discover that the real world is dominated by men. Everything is ""reversed"", she squeals. Ken, by contrast, loves it. I must say, I found the politics of this film utterly incoherent. It's a 12A, but I wouldn't let my six-year-old daughter near it. It's filled with adult concepts, jokes and themes: the idea that men are stupid, go to the gym, run everything and don't care about women, while women are sensible, striving but ultimately conflicted victims.

In the lead up nobody really knew what to expect, except a lot of pink, was it going to be something serious aimed for adults or was it going to be funny and aimed at children? It seems though it wasn't only the cinema going audience asking those questions, they were questions that the filmmakers themselves may have been confused about because the result is a film that seems to awkwardly sit in the middle. Directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) Barbie is a film that actually features a lot of different Barbies and Kens. In the beginning they all live in BarbieLand where the main Barbie (Margot Robbie  The Wolf Of Wall Street) wakes up every day to a perfect day of fun in the sun with her friends. And when the sun sets it is time for her to party. That Barbie also has her Ken (Ryan Gosling  La La Land) who is always doting after her and competing with other Kens for her affection. But sadly, for Ken it is also obvious that his feelings for Barbie are a lot stronger than hers for him. But then one day everything changes. Barbie's life starts to get less perfect  something is beginning to go wrong. The only person with any answers is the one referred to as Strange Barbie (Kate McKinnon  Ghostbusters) who quickly tells Barbie that the issues that the person playing with her in the real world is starting to project onto her. The only way she can solve it is by travelling to the real world and trying to help her 'human.' So, with Ken in tow Barbie makes her way to the real world where she soon meets Gloria (America Ferrera  Superstore) and her daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt  65). But before Barbie can help them the news of her arrival reaches the Mattel CEO (Will Ferrell  Anchorman) who decides that Barbie needs to be put back in her box before there is an incident. Meanwhile Ken begins to realise that men can also be leaders and decides to head back to BarbieLand and change things around so it can become his Kengdom which leaves Barbie having to fix problems both there and in the real world. Barbie is kind of a difficult film to review. Not only in this the kind of film that is guaranteed to divide an audience the film almost being split in two halves causes issues of its own. The way Gerwig introduces the audience to BarbieLand is amazing. The characters are set up amazingly well, the dance sequences are stunning and the laughs come thick and fast.

118,BCD_Doc8_Barbie,BCD_Doc8_Barbie,BCD,Comedy,Negative,Barbie,"An existential comedy smothered by a pink thick fog of feminist driven male bashing, Barbie may be marketed as the story of Margot Robbie's enlightened living doll, yet will be remembered for the sad saga of Ryan Gosling's putdown Ken. There is a scene in Barbie where it is explained that the doll should be embraced as a vessel to project inspiring ideas to its fanbase of young impressionable girls. Barbie, the movie, takes that wisdom one step further by becoming a high-heeled Trojan horse from which it espouses all matter of feminist nonsense that is eye-rolling at best and sexist at worst. Directed and co-written by indie-film darling turned studio filmmaker Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and starring Oscar nominated blonde bombshell Margot Robbie, Barbie was marketed as a camp satire to be enjoyed by millennial women and their gay friends, as opposed to the fun playhouse adventure that its true target market  young girls  should have deserved. Gerwig instead delivers a mix of a live-action Toy Story meets the existential dramedy of The Truman Show as if it were scripted by Germaine Greer. Barbie begins with the always stunning Robbie as ""stereotypical"" Barbie, who lives in the utopian matriarchal world of Barbieland along with numerous other variations of Barbie's. These include brunette physician (Emma Mackey), black president (Issa Rae), plump lawyer (Sharon Rooney), and weird damaged goods (Kate McKinnon). Each Barbie has her own house, profession, car, and the biggest accessory of all, a ""Ken"", with the stereotypical version played by Ryan Gosling. When Barbie uncharacteristically questions her existence, she and Ken set off to the ""real-world"", aka California, to find the source of her transition from perfect princess to complex mess, which turns out to be Gloria (America Ferrara) a Mattel employee and mother to disgruntled tween girl Sarah (Ariana Greenblatt). When Barbie finds that the real world doesn't reflect her artificial sensibilities regarding women in society, her existential crisis deepens. Ken, meanwhile, is thrilled to find that men can hold positions of power just like his female overlords, leading to a battle for supremacy in Barbieland. This battle of the sex's scenario transitions Barbie from an entertaining fantasy satire into a consistently sexist propaganda piece, in which men both artificial and real are presented as dullard brutes. Where Barbie's interaction with the real world inspires an ideological, inspirational, and philosophical awakening of what it is to be a woman, Ken embraces ""the patriarchy"" and all its ""toxic masculinity"", which in Gerwig's film means drinking lots of beer while viewing women as sexual objects. Considering Ken has no balls, such testosterone driven horn-bag behaviour is a mystery. Real world representations of men are even more problematic. Will Ferrell's portrayal of a Mattel CEO feels less like a character and more a throwaway sketch parody from his Saturday Night Live days. Even worse is the portrayal of Gloria's husband (ironically played by Ferrara's real husband Ryan Piers Williams) as a slack jawed dullard. No doubt the dolt"

Unfortunately, in her new film, Barbie, director Greta Gerwig (Little Women)working with her co-screenwriter (and romantic partner) Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story)ruins every good idea and amusing premise with an overabundance of direct speech, devoid of nuance, thereby taking those few elements that work in the movie and crushing them under the weight of obvious excess. The cast is game, but the script is lame. That doggerel about sums it up. Margot Robbie (Amsterdam) stars as one of many live-action Barbies. She is the ""stereotypical"" (aka, original design) Barbie, but her fellow denizens of Barbieland represent a vast array of races, ethnicities, body types, and more (including a trans Barbie), all ably portrayed by a supporting ensemble that includes Ritu Arya (Polite Society), Ana Cruz Kayne (Susie Searches), Emma Mackey (Emily), Hari Nef (Meet Cute), Issa Rae (The Photograph), Sharon Rooney (The Electrical Life of Louis Wain), and Alexandra Shipp (tick, tick... BOOM!), among others. They are powerful women, fully in charge of their (make-believe) realm. And then there are the Kens, an equally diverse group, all infatuated with one of the plethora of Barbies. In that bunch, we find folks like Kingsley Ben-Adir (One Night in Miami) and Simu Liu (Simulant), as well as Ryan Gosling (First Man), who plays the archetypal blonde Ken who is eternally focused on wooing Robbie's Barbie. And then there is Allan (Michael Cera, Gloria Bell), a ""Ken's buddy"" model that petered out soon after his introduction in the 1960s. There's just one of him, and that's plenty to go around. Following a somewhat funny (if forced) 2001: A Space Odyssey-takeoff of a prologue, the movie begins, narrated in arch tones by Helen Mirren (The Good Liar), in an idyllic pink paradise where all the various iterations of Barbie rule the land in happy harmony, the Kens always at their beck and call. The blissful repetition of the same wonderful day lived over and again, like a daydream version of Groundhog Day, is brutally interrupted when our primary Barbie (Robbie) is suddenly struck by thoughts of death. To make matters worse, her feet, usually frozen in a permanent high-heeled-tilt formation, turn flat. The horror! And so she goes to visit ""weird Barbie"" (Kate McKinnon, Bombshell), whose hair is cut short (and dyed strange colors), who explains that what is happening to Robbie-Barbie is what happened to her. She is being played with, in the real world, by someone with dark thoughts, and that these are affecting her behavior. Worse, there appears to be a rip in the space-time continuum, creating a symbiotic link between that real world and Barbieland. In order to fix it, Robbie-Barbie must travel to the fabled land of Los Angeles to right the wrongs in the little girl causing all the havoc. So off she goes, with Gosling-Ken sneaking along in the back of her car. All of the above works pretty well, with Gerwig"

Worse, the spat underlines the filmmakers' delusion that this ""Barbie"" is something more than just another ploy to sell merchandise. Gerwig's movie starts with a cliche. A narrator (Helen Mirren) says, ""Since the beginning of time, there have always been dolls,"" as a group of little girls surround a giant Barbie and violently smash their old toys to smithereens. It's sending up the monolith scene from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that has been parodied forever.

I can't believe he made her pay and even told her ahead of time to bring cash. And his name's Chad! Lmao, oh that's perfect. It's guys like Chad that make it harder for actual good guys to have a chance. These guys create doubt in women's minds. I've never used dating apps, but is this really how the dating app world can be for women? Seems pretty daunting. The tone of this movie is bizarre, it's as if the characters in this world aren't that human. The guy tasting the milk at the grocery store and the lady working the register gave this impression. The chemistry between the two mains is entertaining to watch, it's actually what propels the movie forward. I like how the movie creates this sense of uneasiness and dread without really telling you what is going on or what's about to happen, it keeps you anticipating. This movie has some very dark and disturbing humor, but it is good humor nonetheless. And the performances of both Sebastian Stan and Daisy Jones really bring that out. Sebastian nails it as the creepy and menacing but funny villain. He's definitely got the comedic chops, he is one funny dude. Woah, he sells human female meat to rich weirdo cannibals. Ok this is insane, this just got weirdly interesting. I get what the movie's trying to do. It's trying to make us think about the food we eat, in particular the animal meat we eat. It does a great job at filming food and meat in a grotesque manner that makes it unappetizing. They're trying to turn us into vegetarians, I see lol. That's crazy how Steve's wife is in on it.

I just realized they met in the vegetable section of the grocery store, that's pretty funny.

The sympathize with a character or not. And that is exactly what makes it work so well. FRESH begins as a bit of parody of the current dating scene (as a 59-year-old married for 37 years, I can't relate, but I can be horrified and amused). We meet Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) on her first date with super obnoxious Chad. They're at a restaurant, and in the space of just a minute or so, he insults Noa's choice of clothing and just her life choices in general. When they agree that the date is going nowhere and are ready to walk out, he asks her to pay for her food but then he wants her leftovers to take home. We sense that for Noa, this is just one in a series of disappointing dates, and when she chats with her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) about it, we're pretty much assured that Noa's dating life has hit a wall. But she has a ""meet cute"" in the grocery store with the goofy, but somehow still charming Steven (Sebastian Stan) and they have immediate tentative chemistry (yes, I know that's a weird phrase, but to me, it explains so well how Noa can feel sparks flying, but also can't make herself believe that was really happening). This leads to a date, and then another and then an invite to have a romantic weekend getaway and then everything goes insanely off the rails. Because you know going in that this is NOT a romantic comedy, you're ready for something to happen. But unless you've read more than you should about the film, you are NOT ready for what does happen. (And please, I'm trying hard not to spoil anything...do yourself a favor and read as little about the plot as you can.) Noa finds herself in a situation she could never have imagined, and Steve is not remotely the person we might have hoped. And yet, the sparks are still there. And Noa uses them to her advantage. And Steve, smart as he turns out to be, is still a sucker for a girl who will flatter him. The less said, the better. But I can tell you this. The tone of this movie could so easily have gone off the rails, but writer Lauryn Kahn and particularly director Mimi Cave walk the tightrope expertly. They embrace the uncomfortableness of the situation (again, no spoilers here) pretty head on, and you'll find yourself squirming at times. But it evolves into dark humor. (In fact, if I had to pigeon-hole the film, I'd call it a DEEPLY black dark satire.) And layer on top of that two excellent performances.

'Fresh' is a dark twist on the classic rom-com, bringing audiences a scarily accurate portrayal of dating in today's climate, that echoes Julia Ducournau's 2016 coming-of-age horror 'Raw'. With the title and credits rolling 33 minutes in, 'Fresh' takes audiences on a wild ride, sucking them into a horrifying, yet exciting two hours. 'Normal People' breakout Daisy Edgar-Jones stars as Noa, a young woman fed up with her increasingly miserable dating life. After meeting Steve (Sebastian Stan) at her local supermarket, Noa decides to take plunge, giving him her number and agreeing to a date with the mystery man. However, Noa's newfound love may turn out to be more bitter than sweet. 'Fresh' is a film lead by strong performances from both Daisy Edgar-Jones, (starring in her first role since the acclaimed series 'Normal People') and Marvel star Sebastian Stan. The film's twisted premise allows Daisy to show off her talent outside of the drama genre, considering 'Fresh' is a complete 180 from 'Normal People'. Sebastian Stan completely dissolves into the role of Steve, the actor's charming demeanour peaking through Steve's wicked personality. Pawel Pogorzelski, the cinematographer behind both 'Hereditary' and 'Midsommar', packs 'Fresh' topfull of unsettling, borderline grotesque visuals that shows Mimi Cave isn't afraid to dive straight into the gore. Whether it's the disturbing close-ups or the jarring first-person shots, 'Fresh' goes the extra mile to make audiences as uncomfortable as possible, making the film all the more exciting to watch. However, the third act is when the film begins to go awry, topping the film off with a slightly lacklustre ending that you can't really sink your teeth into. With its disconcerting story, 'Fresh' markets itself as one of the weirder films to come out of the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, but also feeling like one of the more refreshing horror films available today. Lauryn Kahn gives 'Fresh' a brilliant script that allows the film to appeal to eager horror fans while also appealing to those who are new to the genre. Kahn's script also manages to inject comedy into a film that could easily be ten times scarier without it. All in all, 'Fresh' is a marvellous directorial debut from Mimi Cave, who brings audiences a darkly twisted rom-com lead by knockout performances from Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan. Setting itself up to be one of 2022's grossest films, 'Fresh' pulls you in from the get-go, keeping you thoroughly entertained with a perverted love story encased in sick, cannibalistic tendencies while also managing to be an accurate social commentary. 'Fresh' is just one of the many films from recent years that injects terrifying horror into the world of dating, falling on the same level as films like Academy Award winner 'Get Out', 'I'm Thinking of Ending Things', 'Pet', and 'Midsommar'."

A black comedy, a satire on class and opulence, and a disquieting and alarmingly grotesque horror survival film, ""Fresh"" is the type of small budget spine-chiller in the vein of ""Hard Candy"" and ""Hush"" where the suspense builds slowly, shocking revelations are meticulously injected, and the story plays on some of the most primal human fears - that of cannibalism, psychopathy, physical and mental torture, distrust, and death. Hitchcockian to be sure, the film is gripping with its nail-biting pacing, credible and harrowing portrayals of human predators and preys, and a truly disturbing and gross concept that can actually happen. Edgar-Jones is astoundingly vulnerable as a deeply wounded and agonized woman and Stan has a field day in a devilishly wicked turn as her lover/tormentor. A scary film that truly makes your stomach churn and leaves you disquieted for some time after. Fresh is a fantastic thriller that is both unsettling but intriguing. Sebastian Stan was perfect for this type of role as he plays this Dahmer/Bundy serial killer which he has the charm for. This is my first time watching Daisy Edgar-Jones on screen and she is amazing. This movie does well at making this story feel realistic with online dating and how scary it can be. If you get unsettled by gore, cut off body parts, and cannibalistic acts then this movie might not be for you as the movie does have some twisted dark humor that fits the movie so well. The pacing was great as no scene dragged and never made me want to stop watching as the story and it's plot and execution was compelling and engaging. I would highly recommend this movie if you're a horror fan and like twisted thrillers like this. Fresh gets an A+. A 'fresh' horror film, that's both engaging and disturbing, and more in depth than one would expect. With stellar acting from Edgar-Jones, we are brought into Noa's circumstance and feel the same unnerve of what is (and isn't) to come. It's unsettling but its addicting. The film has a lot of unpredictability and nuance which keeps it dialed in to its purpose, rarely diverging. It keeps a tight cast, set, and story, coupled with great filmography and sound design. As dark & twisted as it may get, it never quite strays - leaving the audience hungry to learn more by its end. An impressive & worthy addition to the horror-comedy genre."
125,CWM_Doc5_Fresh,CWM_Doc5_Fresh,CWM,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"""Fresh"" is so cool! Curiously, it's not the first film I saw about cannibalism. I saw ""Raw"" before and when it's revealed that Sebastian Stan's character is a cannibal (imagine, just imagine, if he was made by Armie Hammer) and sells human meat, I thought the film would follow the same approach of that one, but no. Surprisingly, the film adopts a comic tone, and it manages to never romanticise the relationship between Daisy and Sebastian, even sometimes adopting the rom-com style. It's a movie style that I perfectly imagine Jordan Peele directing. By the way, Jonica T. Gibbs and Dayo Okeniyi are if Lil Rel Howery's character in ""Get Out"" if he was spilt into two. Daisy Edgar-Jones is not the best actress in the world, she has to improve a lot if she wants to win an Oscar, but here she's competent. What elevates, and a lot, the level of this production, is the ambience. The combo production design + cinematography creates a universe that fits perfectly three or four genres: romance, comedy, thriller and horror. My only issue here is that sometimes Daisy's character looks to not suffer the consequences of a certain act, and sometimes she's a little dumb, but nothing of this impede this film from being one of the funniest horror movies of the year alongside ""X"" (which is undeniably better). Solid and innovative horror film that delivers a nice mix of scares and humor, along with a larger commentary on dating life. Daisy Edgar-Jones is instantly appealing as Noa, a young woman who just wants to meet the right guy, despite the horrendous dating environment. The seen stealer, though, is Sebastian Stan as Steve, instantly charming even when he starts to do some very bad things. Behind the camera, director Mimi Cave crafts a fun horror film with some nice commentary on dating, along with some pretty morbid subjects. The one downside is that is goes on a bit too long, and could have been helped by cutting out on some characters. Overall, one of the better horror films in recents years, and definitely worth checking out if you have Hulu. I have never experienced a movie that juxtaposes itself more than with Fresh. The first 30 minutes is a nice friendly rom com style movie filled with the common tropes of the genre; but after that it switches into a dark thriller that has you on the edge of the seat the entire film. It was incredibly refreshing seeing Sebastion Stan play a villain and really showed off the actor's chops. My one complaint is there is a few times where characters do make dumb decisions to progress the plot that shows some minor lazy horror writing, but that is a minor nitpick."

It was decently acted with Sebastian Stan's talent completely wasted on a b-grade thriller. The final conclusion was not worth the two hour wait time, I felt like I wasted my time watching this movie. I would not recommend this to anyone. For a movie that was supposed to be horror and thriller, I wasn't fearful or that thrilled (maybe merely at 34-36 mins into the movie when it finally begins and that's all). The movie took forever to get started and then once it started, there wasn't much to keep you captured. The cannibalism wasn't gory. Not much blood at all for any of these scenes. Maybe intentionally done, so people could stomach it. There was more romance than anything strangely. I didn't see a victim in distress tryin to ""act"" ok, So that more so felt awkward and just off as I knew what situation Noa was in. Like why was even the background music so romantic, just weird. Not creepy just weird. Comedy? I didn't see it. Maybe that's my bad? I kept waiting for something crazy to happen or for it to be over. I guess points for the women saving themselves in the end, although that also felt forced. A very boring and stale horror with obvious conclusions. The dark humour wasn't even that great to at least give it an edge. The ending made me want to rewind time and not decide to watch it! A few good scenes, but overall predictable and odd. Many things made zero sense, some characters were just randomly thrown in for absolutely no reason (bartender dude - why'd he drive there all the way just to head back again, his character had zero impact on the story, wasted Screen time). Main character has a few brain cells left and sometimes uses them. Mimi Cave's directional debut where she tries to capture something disturbing yet comedic falls flat with Fresh. The only decent quality that deserves any credit is the cinematography done by Pawel Pogorzelski. Other than that, the film just doesn't do it for me. The idea that Fresh has is really intriguing but the story as a whole is simply not engaging. Maybe because of the lazy writing by Lauryn Kahn.

127,CWM_Doc7_Fresh,CWM_Doc7_Fresh,CWM,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"I feel like the film had trouble getting to where it really wanted its main focus to be -- and the characters and writing I just didn't buy. Another ""woke"" movie that feels like I'm being preached at instead of entertained. Same old boring narratives throughout: white people bad, black people good, rich people evil, poor people virtuous...YAWN. It's a shame since the story's premise is unique and there were some clever plot twists. If film makers focused on creating actual FILMS instead of pushing political messages, the world would be a much better (and diverse) place. Not great. It was very mundane and the story wasnt the best. The acting was ok. There was a random dancing part in the middle which was just surreal. It went with the story line but still random. Just a very strange weird movie with not much substance. Meh.... gotta say, I was a little disappointed and can't quite understand the high ratings for this. Yes, the two leads (Daisy Edgar-Jones & Sebastian Stan) have nice chemistry and the first fourth of the movie - when the movie goes down the rom-com path - is actually charming and fun to watch. But as soon as the twist sets in about 35 minutes into the movie, it just can't deliver equally on the horror part. The twist itself is a cool idea, but sadly the movie isn't half as provocative as it thinks it is, and also instead of accelarating the pace the movie slows down and really drags over large parts of the remaining almost 90 minutes of runtime. See, a movie with an audacious premise like this should be fast-paced, outrageous, and with a wicked sense of humor. This one is just way too tame overall. 2.5 for the two charming leads, that's it. Nope. Mislead by this one. The trailers and press don't at all showcase what the film is actually like. Totally depraved. You have to endure the protagonist being surgically harmed against her will. She's held captive and harmed. The trailer is totally, completely off from what this film actually is. The beautiful yet emotionally withdrawn damsel is smitten by the attractive yet mysterious suitor only to discover a bit too late that his intentions aren't quite what they seem! Continue to exchange one trope for another until you get to the big finale where everything pans out exactly as expected. This flick is moderately entertaining, but it's easy enough to check out mentally after the first act and still manage to keep track of what's going on and what happens next."

I wouldve gave this movie a better review but the first 30 minutes was unnecessarily long they couldve cut it down to 20 or 15 minutes, it makes no difference in the movie. By the time the movie actually starts I already hated it. Its too much lame indie rom com by the time something finally happens youll hate the movie already. This is ""horror/comedy?"" Well, I guess they call it horror because it's supposed to be terrifying. It's not terrifying. It's somewhat gruesome, yes, but so screamingly unoriginal that it's laughable, only... it's definitely not comedy, because there's nothing funny. This is pandering to and derivative of so many things it's hard to figure out where to begin, so I won't. It completely squanders its one small kernel of originality. And what it with all this dancing BS? Nothing to do with anything. Well acted, well shot, strong production values across the board except for the writing. Did a 10th grader write it? Sorry to all the truly creative 10th graders out there who could do way better, but this is not out of high school as far as any kind of sophistication. The screenplay is total amateur hour. Can't stand it. I'm failing to see why people thought this movie was so great. It was very boring, had humor in odd situations that ruined scenes. Stupid twists that were not necessary. People just doing stupid things so the plot can happen? The whole movie was just a let down, and when I see 81% people enjoyed it. That really makes me lose faith in humanity."

This stuff is all too real in life & I for 1 think it's a travesty. This film sucked, period. I'm sorry, but I seem to be the only one on the planet who noticed this. Isn't this movie just an elevated Lifetime channel movie??? It has literally all the unbelievable tropes in Lifetime movies, and I'm shocked at how many critics seem to think it is so creative. From the second he told her he doesn't have any social media, my mind went straight to Pool Boy Nightmare. Either I'm the only horror fan who watches Lifetime movies for fun, or I'm the only Lifetime fan who also watches real horror movies. I listened to an interview with the director, and she didn't even seem aware how closely her movie follows the nauseatingly typical Lifetime movie formula. Not literally the best breath-taking, keep you on the edge of your seat kind of movie. It was disturbing, kinda predictable and illogical. But fairly to say, Daisy's performance was perfect, made me cry twice and sympathize with her character despite her reckless choices at the beginning. Sebastian knew too how to portray such a psychotic character. But literally the only true moral of this movie, GIRL POWER always wins. It was satisfying. It started promising, Daisy and Sebastian are both very charismatic and talented actors, although Sebastian is no Jack Nicholson yet. The horror is mostly suggestive, but it doesn't ad value to keep it that way. That Nos can still walk quite elegantly with no ass(muscles), doesn't make it realistic either. The last 30 minutes are just annoying, as if there was no money or inspiration left. All the guys are either psychopaths, perverts or cowards and th ending is disappointing to say the least, the wokeness is drippin' of the walls. The premise was really brilliant.

Overall, Mimi Cave's Fresh is actually not fresh but somewhat stale instead. I hope this doesn't constitute spoiler but all the time I was watching Mimi Cave's high-concept thriller, I keep thinking of and comparing it to Get Out (there's even a deliberate nod to the ending of Jordan Peele's film which I consider the funniest gag here), and I'm not entirely sure if it's a good thing or not. Playing like a female #MeToo variation, Lauryn Kahn's screenplay shares some major structural if not conceptual similarities with it, as it throws elements of horror, comedy and (extreme) romance into a grinder to produce a sausage-meat of a film with mixed results. Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones plays unlucky-in-love singleton Noa who meets-cute Sebastian Stan's Steve, a handsome smooth-talking stranger, in her local supermarket (metaphor and foreshadowing in one neat narrative stroke) and for the first half hour of the film, this plays like a typical romcom until the not unexpected penny drops and the title and opening credits finally kick in at this point, signalling the beginning of the real film we're watching, which is as far away from romcom as you can possibly imagine. While Edgar-Jones avoids being irritating in a role that can slip into caricatures and even manages to invoke our sympathy as the damsel in potential distress, Stan feels like he was air-dropped in from a 90s straight-to-video erotic thriller. The plotting holds few surprises here once the film's real intentions are revealed and it's just not scary or tense enough to satisfy this viewer. Silly, trashy, moderately watchable and you get exactly what you expected to get here, this begins promisingly but eventually runs of steam, falling back onto generic conventions. There's an audience for this sort of thing but for me, it merely passes the time. I just don't get how people can say this movie is so amazing and original. I really didn't see much that was unique or 'special' about it. The actors did a decent job and it started out sort of interesting. But we have seen this movie before and I don't get why people say it's so original. Maybe it will be your thing.. but just felt like a waste of time to me.

131,GLQ_Doc1_It_Chapter_Two,GLQ_Doc1_It_Chapter_Two,GLQ,Horror,Positive,It_Chapter_Two,"Stephen King's IT is a colossal book, in more ways than one. Over the course of a thousand pages, King tracks the nature of evil, violence, bigotry, abuse, love and friendship, seen through the eyes of seven children and the adults they later become. Out of necessity, both the 1990 miniseries, and director Andy Muschietti's duology, have adapted the novel into two parts, but only Muschietti's IT Chapter Two centres solely on the adults (barring brief flashbacks in which they reconfront the horrors their past selves endured). Some pace-based missteps aside, IT Chapter Two is a satisfying conclusion to one of horror's true epics. It's 2016, 27 years after preteens Bill (Jaeden Martell), Beverly, (Sophia Lillis) Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Stan (Wyatt Oleff), and Mike (Chosen Jacobs) sealed away the shapeshifting evil entity that most often manifests as Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgard, reprising his role from the first film). Six of the seven members of the Losers Club have left Derry and gone on to have successful careers as adults: Bill (James McAvoy) is a bestselling novelist; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) co-runs a fashion label with her domineering husband; Ben (Jay Ryan) is an acclaimed architect; Eddie (James Ransone) is a financial analyst; Richie (Bill Hader) is a standup comedian; and Stan (Andy Bean) is an accountant and entrepreneur. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has remained in Derry all this time, watching and waiting for the day when evil returns. After a series of disappearances culminates in a violent assault and a frightening message from Pennywise, Mike realizes it's time to call the Losers back to Derry, to fight It for one final showdown. All seven lead actors play fantastically off the habits and traits of the children we were introduced to in Chapter One and how those traits have translated into adulthood. Hader and Ransome are especially adept at this  Hader plays Richie as the kind of vulnerable adult who hides his repressed fears under crass jokes, and Ransome captures the same sense of manic paranoia Eddie exhibited in childhood. As a cohesive unit, though, this older Losers Club lacks the naturalness and energy that led to the original seven kids being such engaging presences. It may be because we spend so much time with the adult Losers individually, both in Derry and outside it, that we don't have much of a chance to see how this chemistry reiterates  or doesn't  when the Losers age into adulthood. Because of this sustained separation, the pace of the film starts to stall, despite impressive visuals and engaging performances. Once the action really begins and the final battle with It ramps up, the film's pace increases to breakneck, showing off a variety of gleefully creepy, ambitious, inventive set pieces, from a fantastic homage to John Carpenter's The Thing to the world's scariest Monty Hall Problem. Pennywise's attacks are more psychological this time, and cut to the core of the various ways the"

He has had time to stew on things as IT CHAPTER 2 picks up 27 years after the first film. While most of the kids from the Loser's Club have moved out of Derry, Maine, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa/Chosen Jacobs) has remained. Haunted by the events of the past, he keeps ever vigilant for IT's possible return. When mysterious disappearances begin occurring once again, Mike reaches out to his childhood friends to remind them of their promise to return to kill IT once and for all. I am happy to report that IT Chapter 2 is a worthy sequel to the first film, and in some ways even better. Bigger risks are taken, the violence is more unhinged and effective, scenes get more abstract and dreamlike, and it carries a surprising emotional weight. The film deftly jumps from present to past and back again thanks to a nimble script by Gary Dauberman and clear direction from Andy Muschietti. This necessitates employing the younger performers from the first film along with a new ensemble of expertly cast adult actors. The effect is consistency in character that adds a unique gravitas to the collective performances. We are first reintroduced to all of the Losers as they get the fateful call that pulls them back to their painful childhoods in Derry and the film begins. All but one of the Losers immediately hop onto planes and return home with the exception of Stanley (Andy Bean/Wyatt Oleff). Once back, the Losers meet for dinner at the Jade of the Orient. Each of the losers arrives and sizes one another up in their own way. Beverly (Jessica Chastain/Sophia Lillis), Bill (James McAvoy/Jaeden Martell) Richie (Bill Hader/Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (James Ransone /Jack Dylan Grazer), and Ben (Jay Ryan/Jeremy Ray Taylor) sit at a round table, reconnecting until a lingering feeling of dread takes hold again. As they all slowly recall the evil they faced 27 years before, Mike attempts to convince them that it is their obligation to stay, confront the evil, and defeat it for good. The initial response is to run, screaming into the night and never look back. After a bit of convincing, they all realize that the only way to fight fear is to confront it. Dauberman's script goes to great pains to include the rich mythos of IT as an ancient, cosmic creature that has tormented the area for hundreds of years without sacrificing narrative momentum. The film even goes so far as to touch on the local Native Americans tactics in facing off with the creature and how that could help the Losers. Saddled with their marching orders, each adult Loser heads off to seek a ""token"" to be used in a ritual that will destroy IT for good. As this plays out, Pennywise lets the Losers know he is aware they have returned. This leads to one particularly effective scene of Beverly returning to her childhood home only to"

But that film was only half the story, literally. Stephen King's 1986 source novel divided its action into two sections, set 27 years apart. So It: Chapter Two finds the protagonists of the previous film all grown up, all unhappy, and trying to repress their 27-year-old memories of a child-eating clown named Pennywise (Skarsgard). But Mike (Mustafa) stayed behind in their hometown of Derry, obsessing over Pennywise, while all the rest of his ""gang"" The Losers moved on and away. When it seems like ""It"" has returned to fulfil his 27-year murder cycle, Mike summons The Losers back to Derry to fulfil the promise they made to deal with the murderous clown once and for all. The success of the first film (which works as a standalone movie) saw this sequel greenlit with double the budget and a top-shelf cast. It's this quality cast - notably Chastain, McAvoy and Hader - that helps elevate Chapter Two above its potentially schlocky material. A handy FX budget also helps sell some of the more ludicrous effects sequences, particularly in the inevitably CG-heavy showdown. But the way the material is handled is top-shelf too. Whereas the first film dealt with adolescents on the brink of adulthood and the typical fears that come with coming of age, here we find the protagonists on the brink of mid-life crises, riddled with uncertainty and haunted by their pasts. Unrequited loves, closeted sexuality, childhood trauma, unfulfilled lives, self doubts - these are as much a part of the nightmares of The Losers' lives as the monstrous Pennywise. As much as the likes of Chastain, McAvoy and Hader (and Ryan and Ransone too) bring the goods in the acting stakes, it's Pennywise's show. Aided by some freaky make-up and FX work, Skarsgard is again utterly terrifying, his performance a masterclass in scary. He again makes It's secret weapon, of course, ""It"". While the film leans heavily on its jump scares, delayed jump scares, and rising soundtrack, it also finds other ways to unnerve. A kid alone in the dark with Pennywise lit by a single firefly, a broad daylight encounter between Hader's Richie and Pennywise, an old lady acting strangely in a loungeroom, Pennywise headbutting a glass wall trying to break through - all of these moments will have you checking under your bed when you get home. Pennywise may be the star, but special mentions goes to Hader, who gives the performance of his career. He's hilarious, providing some much needed levity amid the po-faced seriousness, but he also helps make Richie the most well-rounded and interesting character of The Losers. It's an under-rated turn from an under-rated actor in a film you might not necessarily seek out for its top-notch thespianism. The only"

It was a decent movie, bloated in most places and built upon the youthful pains and joy of its child characters. However, while It Chapter Two is just as bloated and unnecessarily long as its predecessor, there's much more nuance in its exploration of the ways in which adulthood can been impacted by childhood trauma and the psychology of fear. The fear of being, the fear of being who your memories have forgotten you were, the fear of blame and so much more. Set 27 years after the first film, It Chapter Two has grown up just like its characters have. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) is back and with him returns terror and murder to the small town of Derry. Called back to the place they left years ago, the Losers must face their own fears and find a way to take down the creature that's haunted them for decades before It starts killing more children. It Chapter Two leaves you with an uneasy feeling as the characters wade their way through repressed memories and trauma. One of the things that stands out the most is the film's perspective on memory and what we choose to remember as adults. Do we recall who we actually were or the things we wanted to be? What is it that we choose to remember versus what we choose to repress? Is the memory of fear greater than the fear itself? There are so many layers that the film delves into. Chapter Two's runtime is so incredibly long, though, that it asks the audience to wait patiently before it gets to its semi anticlimactic end. While some may have wanted a lot more of the horror aspects, the film's strengths lie in the effects of that horror. It Chapter Two thankfully ditches a lot of the excess humor of its predecessor (not that there isn't any and when it the comedic beats land, they work), and understands that the adult versions of the characters are twice as interesting as their child counterparts. However, an example of how the film glosses over some of its characters is most apparent in the way it mishandles Isaiah Mustafa's Mike. The man who decided to stay in Derry, haunted by the ever-present shadow of Pennywise's return is also the character who gets the least screentime. His fear is barely explored and when the film touches upon some of his trauma, it comes in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment that plays out as more of an afterthought. The film also completely ignores race as a factor in the '80s. There's only a hint that Mike is stared at as a kid because he's Black and the film refuses to explore his backstory and fear the way it does the other characters. His individual journey is practically nonexistent and it's incredibly noticeable, especially"

King's ""It"" remains one of his most iconic and easily digestible novels, but peculiarly a book that needs drastic alterations to make it more palatable for film. Andy Muschietti had a bonafide challenge on his hands to deliver a two part film that confronted the terror of loss of innocence, and confronting the demons of the past. It all invariably comes dropping down on the Losers Club with the help of the mercilessly vile Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Twenty-seven years after the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, It has re-awakened to terrorize the town of Derry once more. Now adults, the Losers have long since gone their separate ways. However, kids are disappearing again, so Mike, the only one of the group to remain in their hometown, calls the others home to hold true to their childhood oath. Damaged by the experiences of their past, they must each conquer their deepest fears to destroy Pennywise once and for all... putting them directly in the path of the clown that has become deadlier than ever. ""Chapter Two"" is a wonderful return to Derry tapping in to what audiences loved about the first film while also digging in to the more abstract elements of Pennywise's mythology. With ""Chapter Two"" Muschietti and writer Gary Dauberman explore the lasting scars childhood trauma can leave on us and how it consistently dictates who we become as adults. When we meet the Losers Club again, they're fairly well off and successful, but are they really? Muschietti is able to coast through the introductions of the characters in their current state in awfully brilliant ways, diving back and forth in to the lives of these middle aged individuals that have all but forgotten Derry, Maine (often depicted as a Rockwellian nightmare). When Pennywise re-emerges, it's subtle, but it's also the depiction of a monster that's even worse than he ever was. Here, Pennywise is merciless, cunning, and vicious, and Muschietti delivers two especially sad moments of Pennywise preying on his victims. While Pennywise isn't so much a character of malice, the moment he realizes the Losers Club is on the verge of re-uniting, his hunt for victims becomes a means of spiting them and conveying how vicious he can be and how they might be incapable of stopping him once and for all. If I had any complaints is that the threat of Henry Bowers is downplayed, as is the narrative's plot twist involving one of the losers. It just seemed to have more of an emotional punch in the TV movie. In either case, ""Chapter Two"" excels in trying to keep the book as closely to the chest as possible, while also tackling the material that the TV mini-series quite couldn't.

It's hard, from the cheap seats, not to start to agree; the film spends so much of its two-hour-and-45-minute runtime shoving scares down the audience's collective throat that they eventually crossed over to the other side (at least at this particular New York screening) and start giggling at the sheer bogey-man lunacy of it all. To be fair, Chapter Two is mostly more (and more) of the same that made 2017's It one of the highest-grossing horror films of all time: There be mad clowns, and bad drains, and gushing, Costco-size buckets of blood. Except the scrappy kids of the Losers' Club have now grown past the Stranger Things follies of their '80s youth and become grown adults. Or more accurately, grown movie stars: James McAvoy is Bill, a novelist and screenwriter still mourning the violent long-ago death of his little brother, Georgie; Jessica Chastain's Beverly remains the sensitive redhead with supernatural visions, only now she's married to a rich creep who casually beats her; Jay Ryan's Ben has shed his baby fat and become a sleek real-estate mogul; Bill Hader's Richie has successfully graduated to stand-up comedy, and James Ransone's nervous Eddie now does risk assessment, fittingly, for an insurance company. Andy Bean's nebbishy Stanley doesn't get much new backstory, but he seems to be in a nice, stable marriage. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafah) has chosen to remain in tiny Derry, Maine  a picturesque village that just happens to sit over some kind of cursed carnival hellmouth. After an ugly incident there, it's Mike who calls the gang back together to honor their long-ago blood oath, the one that pledged to finish the job if Pennywise (Bill Skarsgaard) ever returned to wreak his red-nose havoc again. It helps to have read Stephen King's doorstop novel, or at least have seen the previous film, if you have any passing interest in the mythology of how and why Pennywise does what he do  which here, apparently, is mostly eat children by the handful like Skittles, and work chortling insult-comic material into his escaped preys' nightmares. Otherwise, you'll have to trust Argentinian director Andy Muschietti to methodically woodchuck his way through 1,100-plus pages of terror, and toss nearly every horror trope into the maw as he does so. It's as if the film can't trust that something is scarier when it's implied than when it's constantly, literally personified by demonic old ladies, skittering man-faced spiders, and murderous, reanimated Paul Bunyans. They're under the bed, in the basement, inside fortune cookies and bathroom stalls and, but of course, a nefarious, disorienting hall of mirrors. Hader and Ransone do a lot to mitigate the long slog from one relentlessly ghoulish set piece to the next; their dry, side-mouthed humor brings much-needed levity in a movie that seems determined to reduce accomplished actors like McAvoy and Chastain to so much panicky meat-snack for Pennywise.

The second half of Stephen King's horror bestseller about the terrifying clown (is there any other kind?) has now been adapted as a separate but frankly laborious film to follow the first one. That was the story of how a bunch of middle-school kids in a small American town in the 1980s banded together to defeat a homicidal harlequin of hell called Pennywise. His relationship to them made him an antichrist version of ET. Now, almost 30 years later, they are all grown up and must return to their home town to face the horrible Pennywise all over again  as adults. Screenwriter Guy Dauberman (who worked on The Conjuring franchise) adapts the second half of King's novel and the director once again is Andy Muschietti. There is some lively stuff here, including a few sensational cameos and interesting ideas about confronting one's personal demons, about homophobia, abuse and depression. It is also about the ubiquitous availability of the past in the digital age and the permanent reunion-stalkerthon of social media, and about the way guilt and shame are built into what we choose to remember and forget about our teenage years. But, like the first film, it becomes a virtual non-narrative anthology of standard jump-scares that could be reshuffled and shown in any order. The second time around, your tolerance for this is tested to destruction and beyond because, unlike the first movie, it is just so pointlessly long: approaching three hours, with our heroes finally beginning to assume a glassy-eyed solemnity like Hogwarts graduates or the Fellowship of the Ring. Muschietti is even hinting at a possible third chapter. The way they battle Pennywise as grownups is not much different from the way they did it as kids (although, arguably, these new confrontations are unlocking painful childhood memories) and Chapter Two seems to consist of an indefinite number of big, scary set pieces, featuring interchangeable snaggle-toothed creatures, or occasionally gigantic, fairground-sized monsters lurching grotesquely up out of nowhere. The scenes deliver reasonably efficient scares, but with the tension level repeatedly and disconcertingly reset afterwards to zero: the scenes don't develop or accumulate anything within a story arc and it feels as if the movie is jumping the shark and jumping back again, increasingly spending more and more time the wrong side of the shark and finally staying there. The situation is that Pennywise (played again by Bill Skarsgard) mysteriously returns to the little town of Derry, Maine, metaphysically reconfigured or reincarnated, perhaps, by an ugly display of homophobic abuse  an interesting acting cameo here for the Canadian director Xavier Dolan. Mike (played now by Isaiah Mustafa) is the only one of the gang to have stayed behind in Derry, and he gets in touch with everyone. Smart, flame-haired Bev is now a well-off professional played by Jessica Chastain, with troubles in her private life that chillingly mirror what she endured as a child; nerdy bespectacled Richie (Bill Hader) is a wisecracking standup comic; Ben (Jay"

A few extraordinary exceptions aside, adaptations of King's work tend to range from acceptable to disastrous. Some draw on weaker material. (There's likely a ceiling on how good any film version of Thinner could be.) Others fail to explore the underlying themes of King's books in favor of scares  like either version of Pet Sematary  or get so lost in the wispier aspects of King's writing that the creators forget the appeal of a good scare or an unsettling moment. (Think back to Hearts in Atlantis, if any memory of it remains.) So when a pretty good film like 2017's It comes along, it tends to look better just by comparison. Adapting the first half of King's ambitious 1986 novel  in which a group of Derry, Maine-based kids battle an evil entity that mostly takes the form of a clown named Pennywise  director Andy Muschietti led a talented group of child actors through a largely faithful adaptation that effectively mixed scares and sentiment. Part one of It featured a few standout setpieces, and while none topped the film-opening sewer grate encounter between a little boy and Pennywise (played with shifty malevolence by Bill Skarsgard), the winning cast worked together beautifully. The film ended on an unresolved note that set the stage for a second chapter. The second half could have been even better, as it brought in an adult cast to address the first installment's still-lingering horrors. It Chapter Two isn't that even-better film, though. It's an appreciably less-engaging film in every way, suffering from lurching storytelling, wild vacillations in tone (even within scenes), and a strong cast that never fully gels as a group. Worst of all, it substitutes excess for suspense in a long middle section that finds one character after another having interchangeable encounters with Pennywise in which the self-proclaimed ""eater of worlds"" never appears to be a real threat. Sure, he munches on a few minor characters, but the main cast appears to be off-limits. At worst, he seems like an eater of child actors and other characters who are much lower on the call sheet than the leads. The film opens with a flashback featuring the cast of the original film (most of them noticeably de-aged via digital effects), the first of many such moments. Screenwriter Gary Dauberman (Annabelle, The Nun) has a hard time staying true to the ""Chapter Two"" portion of the title. He repeatedly returns to the summer of 1989 to flesh out the backstories of the now-middle-aged friends who call themselves the Losers' Club. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has remained behind in Derry, keeping a watchful eye for their enemy's return while setting up house in the attic of the town library. Others have scattered to the four winds, including Bill (James McAvoy), now a successful novelist; Richie (Bill Hader), who's spun his talent for wisecracks into a career as a self-loathing stand-up comic; and Beverly"

Director Andy Muschietti crafts a handsome looking film that spends too much of its arduous, nearly three-hour running time hammering home themes that are apparent to the viewer. Yes, the scars of childhood inform who we become, and no matter how far we run from them, they continue to affect us until we face them head on. Now can we arrive there a little more quickly, please? ""It Chapter Two"" unfolds 27 years after the actions of the first film, and the Loser's Club is all grown up and has left Derry, Maine far in the rearview. Most are doing pretty well for themselves  Richie (Bill Hader) is now a successful stand-up comic, Bill (James McAvoy) is a Hollywood screenwriter, and Beverly has grown into, well, Jessica Chastain  but they're uniformly sick to their stomachs when they get a phone call from their old pal Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) telling them they need to return to Derry. Mike is the only one who has stayed behind in his hometown, and he has spent his days studying the patterns of Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who is back to killing again after nearly 30 years spent dwelling in the sewers. Reluctantly, the gang returns, each member having buried their childhoods and memories of Pennywise in the deep recesses of their memory. (And judging by their lack of familiarity with one another, none of them bothered friending each other on Facebook over the years, either.) In his research, Mike discovered the way to beat Pennywise involves an ancient ritual, requiring each of the Losers to collect a meaningful artifact from their childhood to offer up as a sacrifice to the demon clown. Which means revisiting ugly childhood memories in Derry, where adult figures are grotesque manifestations of Americana at its worst. ""It Chapter Two,"" like its predecessor, lights up when the evil Pennywise is on screen, and Skarsgard's twisted performance  especially the way he lets drool spill over his bottom lip as he stares through his soon-to-be victims and taunts them in his playfully evil clown voice  highlights the film. He's ""It's"" reason for being, the same way Freddy Krueger was the star attraction of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. (""It"" references ""Elm Street"" with several visual homages.) But unlike Freddy, Pennywise is protected; Muschietti keeps him off screen and hidden in the shadows, using him only when needed. It's the film's gift as well as its curse: Pennywise makes his time on screen count, his every laugh more sinister than the one that came before it, and he always leaves you wanting more. And there's a lot more in ""It Chapter Two,"" mostly with the grown-up Loser's Club gang, who often act in tandem with their younger counterparts. Muschietti sends them each on solo"

Every time the film has an interesting choice to make, it makes the wrong one, squandering its stellar cast and Stephen King's rich mythology. Frustratingly overlong and exceedingly myopic, It Chapter Two is one of this year's most disappointing horror blockbusters. It Chapter Two begins with a hate crime. Lifted straight from Stephen King's novel, the film opens with the savage beating of a gay couple by a group of homophobic teens. The more unfortunate of the two, the asthmatic Adrian Mellon, is dumped over a bridge into the river, where an even more gruesome death awaits him at the hands of the primordial evil, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). The scene is quite indicative of how misguided It Chapter Two is, but not for the reasons you might think. Yes, disgusting slurs are slung, and yes, this is a harrowing and triggering depiction of a violent hate crime, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a place in the story. In fact, pretty much everyone involved with the film acknowledges the scene's thematic importance - its prescient weight. Jessica Chastain, who plays the adult version of Beverly Marsh, perhaps conveyed it best in an interview with Variety: ""I think you need that scene because [King] writes about the darkness that's under the surface, the dirt under the fingernails of these small towns or of mankind. That's what It represents. It's the darkness of human behavior."" The cameo casting of gay filmmaker and activist Xavier Dolan as Adrian Mellon seems to underline the scene's potential resonance, and Stephen King himself has implied that Pennywise represents the dark underbelly of humanity, an undying force that both amplifies and feeds off our basest evils. So why does it feel so perfunctory? It Chapter Two is far from a homophobic movie, but it still has no idea how to extrapolate its own opening scene beyond a violent reintroduction of the series' villain. And the film's shortsightedness isn't limited to just its subtext - at every crossroads, creatively and narratively, It Chapter Two makes wrong decisions. Picking up 27 years after the first film, It Chapter Two centers around the return of the Losers Club to Derry, Maine. Having banished Pennywise into the void back in 1988, an adult Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) - the one member of the Club who never left town - is the first to sense the return of the eldritch evil in 2016. Invoking the blood pact made all those years ago, Mike reaches out to Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransome), Ben (Jay Ryan), and Stanley (Andy Bean), recruiting them once again to kill Pennywise. Either due to magic or mystical - the film never elaborates - all of the wayward members of the gang have mostly forgotten their adventures when they were children, with their traumatic memories returning only after making their way"

The second worst might be Marilyn Manson in a convent. Get you a horror movie that can do both? The Conjuring 2, for instance, which takes its titular digit quite seriously, with two spooks and about twice as many jump scares as the 2013 original  and made on a budget twice the size, to boot. With a $40.4 million opening weekend, The Conjuring 2 is already a success, and that was a foregone conclusion: it's a franchise movie by James Wan. As the director of Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring, and the recent smash Furious 7, Wan has proven himself quite the franchise whisperer. Saw spawned six sequels; Insidious, two (and a prequel!); The Conjuring, the current sequel and the spinoff Annabelle. Furious 7 was the highest-grossing film of its franchise, and  more importantly(?)  like most of Wan's movies, it's pretty good; a free-falling, ludicrous delight, the best-cooked version of a meal whose recipe will likely always taste good. Wan's movies are all made of the same basic stuff: good-enough actors and handsomely over-the-top plots put in service of precise, effective direction. His priorities are studio priorities. (Is it any wonder he was poached by Warner Bros. and DC Comics to helm the upcoming Aquaman? What took so long?) In the heat of this summer's franchise fever, you might settle into the same romantic complaint about commerce's chokehold on ""original art,"" but here comes Wan, again, delivering another wildly successful summer movie that exemplifies, if not incredible vision, the kind of tried, true, classically satisfying summer moviegoing that's proving just as elusive as stark originality. The Conjuring 2 is based on the infamous ""Enfield Poltergeist""  Bill Wilkins, the aforementioned mean old guy  that made a mess of the English press in the late '70s, in large part because it was widely decided to be a hoax. Wan sets up shop in the home of the Hodgsons, a fatherless, four-sibling family living in a tight and untidy council house in Brimsdown, of London's Enfield county, where both sky and skin are ashen with cold and rain. The corners of the Hodgsons' house are sootier than a Dickens orphan's face  a ready-made spook fest that Wan milks for all (and possibly more than) it's worth, gliding his camera in smooth, tight arcs that make every nook of the house feel like a revelation lies in wait. It is a basic thing done very well, in many ways a pristine example of what Wan always shows up to do. He's going to keep you anxious  nothing can feel totally stable when a camera never ceases to move. His ghosts are going to"

I forgot that going to a horror movie alone is risky business because 1) you are literally left SCARED AND ALONE, but 2) when you accidentally let out a scream, you don't have a friend's armpit in which you can burrow your face out of shame. So shit, I yelped, sitting all by myself, and basically spent the rest of the movie with my teeth clenched, afraid I might let out more unfiltered sounds of sheer terror. As the resident horror creep of Complex, I thought I definitely had this in the bag but instead I suffered a series of minor heart attacks, thanks to James Wan's crafty camera tricks. The man knows how to turn an average jump-scare into something you piss your pants over. Instead of overused cuts, he'll often do a long, reactive pan that lets you notice the changed element in the room, whether that be a creepy old man suddenly lurking behind you or a toy fire truck rolling towards you in the middle of the night. It's the kind of scare where you can see it coming but it still makes you jump out of your seat. Wan, who directed Saw, Insidious 1 and 2, and both Conjuring movies, knows a thing or two about scaring his audience, and he uses everything he's learned over the years to make Conjuring 2 this summer's ultimate scream fest. It might also be the ultimate summer date movie. Hear me out: I witnessed a man and woman sitting in front of mewho had only just met at the screeningreach out for each other's hands at a really scary part as the guy whispered, ""Girl, I got you,"" masking his cowardice with chivalry. (I hope they exchanged numbers after the movie.) But sitting in the back row all by myself, I had no one's hands to grab, not even a stranger's. What a mistake. It's because of Wan's tricks that there's an element of freshness to the Conjuring sequel, even when there's nothing much else original to the story. Haunted house, paranormal investigators, possessed young girlyou know the drill. But when you're in a dark room and you can't tell if that demon nun is real or just a painting, it's scary as hell. Advertised as the Amityville of England, this sequel finds a family of fivesingle mother (Frances O'Connor) and her four childrenexperiencing demonic occurrences in their home, with the youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) being most affected. Eventually, the wicked spirit takes over her body as a vehicle for misdeeds and she starts speaking in a deep, demon-possessed voice (like Linda Blair in The Exorcist), playing ventriloquist's puppet to the disturber, a man named Bill who claims this is his house. The young Wolfe gives one hell of a bleary-eyed performance, switching on and off from Damien-level horrifying to poor little girl who just wants one peaceful night of sleep.

The actual director is James Wan, who has followed up his superb ""The Conjuring"" (2013) with another virtuosic exercise in mobile camerawork and moldering production design, tethered to a story that handles its characters and their working-class milieu with an unexpectedly grounded, sensitive touch. Generous with jolts but devoid of gratuitous bloodshed, these are the rare horror movies that seem more interested in how people live than how they die. The sequel picks up several years after the events of ""The Conjuring,"" which introduced us to Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), a real-life married couple who devoted their lives to investigating the paranormal, most famously the Amityville Horror in 1976. Chillingly re-enacted here in a prologue worthy of ""In Cold Blood,"" that notorious case took a terrible toll on the Warrens, and has left Lorraine especially reluctant to leave their New England home to chase yet another haunting. History and Hollywood, alas, have left them little choice. Loosely based on a series of wall-rattling, furniture-throwing and thoroughly hair-raising events that gripped the London borough of Enfield in the late '70s, ""The Conjuring 2"" takes its time flying the Warrens across the Atlantic. (A bit too much time, given the film's generous 134-minute length.) The Enfield demon likes to get to know its victims: first Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe), an impressionable 13-year-old whom we first see fiddling with a homemade spirit board, and then her three siblings, and eventually their single mother, Peggy (the excellent Frances O'Connor), who's already at her wits' end trying to keep food on the table. The terrors that befall this struggling family are nothing you haven't seen before: chairs that rock of their own accord, a TV that suddenly switches channels (never more scarily than when it lands on Margaret Thatcher), guttural voices and possessed toys and doors that go bump in the night. But Wan has a gift for investing even the creakiest cliches with shivery elan. He has always been a versatile connoisseur of genre thrills (his credits include ""Furious 7,"" the original ""Saw"" and the two ""Insidious"" movies), but there is something about the Warrens' case files that pushes his filmmaking into the realm of the rhapsodic. Evincing a patience and mastery of mise-en-scene increasingly rare in mainstream horror cinema, Wan isn't above resorting to a good, cheap shock, and he has one bogeywoman up his sleeve so frighteningly effective  let's just call her, literally, the nun from hell  that even the movie can't stifle a nervous giggle.

Well, duh. Wan's fans  and even those who aren't so hot on the man behind the edgy goregasm Saw, Dead Silence, and two Insidious films  know all too well that Mr. Wan wants to give audiences 1970s-style spookshows, redolent of The Exorcist, Robert Wise's underrated Audrey Rose, and similar disquieting fare. And to a large part, with The Conjuring 2, he succeeds. It's a much subtler descent into the weird than the first film, which was burdened by a surfeit of hoary horror show tropes, among them slamming doors, shock cuts, and ""gotchas""  graveyard gimcrackery that was old hat even when Wise used plenty of it in that great American haunted house story, The Haunting. Refreshingly, there's nary a cheap scare manifested in this Conjuring, although the unspoken corollary to that is that The Conjuring 2 just isn't very scary, or even unnerving. And at over two hours long, it could easily shed 30 minutes or so and still feel bloated in psychical shop talk, if not in actual wraiths. (An aside: There's a genuinely unnerving apparition decked out in a nun's habit; the wicked, taboo-shattering genre sub-niche of ""nunsploitation"" hasn't been revived as of yet, possibly because the current Pope seems so downright hip and with-it that one can almost visualize him cracking open a bottle of Trappist monk-brewed Westmalle Tripel and throwing School of the Holy Beast in an old Vatican VHS player. Probably not Ken Russell's The Devils, though.) Returning from exorcism round one are Wilson and Farmiga as ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren. Semi-retired, they're called back into action by the bedevilment of the Hodgson family. Harried and then horrified single mother Peggy (O'Connor, excellent) suspects a poltergeist when her preteen daughter Janet (Wolfe) begins levitating, foaming at the mouth, and then speaking in the raspy, vulgar voice of someone  or more likely something  that says it was the grotty council flat's previous, now deceased tenant. The Warrens, a Catholic priest, and a television news team embark on getting to the bottom of all this unearthly tommyrot, but it's Lorraine who finally figures out what's actually going on. Wan regular Joseph Bishara helps the proceedings immensely with a restless and occasionally appropriately jarring score that, on the whole, is more ominous than anything else in the film. While The Conjuring 2 is clearly on a slow burn, the final 10 minutes ramp things up to an unholy  and wholly unbelievable and contrived  degree, effectively canceling out the less histrionic and thus more effective sense of chilly unease of all that came before.

With the exception of its arsenal of analog ghost-hunting equipment, the 2013 film largely ignored the pop-cultural bric-a-brac of its early-1970s setting, instead lingering on the era's clothing and interior design: floral wallpapers, fabric ties, massive armoires, and the shared bedrooms of indistinguishable siblings. The film was a well-executed fount of maximalist chills, but its modest trappings lent The Conjuring a patina of classical elegance. The Conjuring 2 finds the evangelical paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) housebound, reduced to a voluntary retirement after their work combating the 1976 Amityville horrors, which are recreated in a flashy prologue. For the next hour, the film follows a formula more like Wan's Furious 7 than any of his previous horror efforts. It's a series of undifferentiated, if often extremely entertaining, genre scares, distinguished by judicious shock cuts and roving tracking shots. Before finally sending the Warrens back to work, the film alternates listlessly between PTSD-enhanced terrors experienced by the clairvoyant Lorraine and those wrought upon a new beleaguered family: the Hodgsons of London's Enfield borough, purported victims of a poltergeist haunting from 1977 until 1979. This wildly undisciplined sequel is the inverse of its predecessor: The Enfield house is small, but it's as full of traps as it is winking jokes. In the living room, the walls are rotting with moisture as a worn leather chair creaks unbidden and the family telly cycles through images of a young Margaret Thatcher. An eerie, vaginal-looking children's play tent lies at one end of a narrow second floor hallway; at the other, young Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) shares a bedroom with her sister, Margaret (Lauren Esposito). Humpty Dumpty sits on a dresser, waiting to fall, surrounded by posters of aging teen idol David Soul. Such a clutter of empty signifiers is emblematic of the film as a whole, which only bothers to develop its characters in the immediate run-up to its extended finale. Wolfe makes a solid impression as the Hodgson's beleaguered satanic medium, but Frances O'Connor's harried mother is given far less attention than Lili Taylor's equivalent character in the original. On a scene by scene basis, The Conjuring 2 is a model of heightened tension and uneasy release (Don Burgess's camera always feels like it's ready to be jostled), but the tropes propelling these night terrors, particularly the CGI-addled teleportation and Wan's increasingly tired sonic melanges of ghostly moans and clanking pipes, grow stale pretty quickly. The film attempts to fold broad thematic conceptsmedia hysteria about possession, the sanctification of the Warrens' faith in both God and the paranormal, maybe a critique of the British public housing system under Tory ruleinto its breakneck final act, but most of these ideas are undercut by a haphazard structure.

The sequel to 2013's surprise hit opens with the infamous paranormal investigation that made Ed and Lorraine Warren household names, if those households subscribed to the National Enquirer. The name says it all: Amityville, in an allegedly haunted house that spawned 14 horror flicks, mostly rubbish. Wan stages a chilling re-enactment of the house's factual mojo-spoiling event, in the context of a seance shaking the Warrens' resolve to bust ghosts. The passage thumps with dread, and suddenly a 15th version of Amityville's horror would be just fine. Then The Conjuring 2 gets down to new supernatural business that never quite measures up to its prologue or preceding movie. Wan still knows how to tighten screws and visually and sonically stab our nerves. As the Warrens, Vera Farmiga and St. Petersburg's Patrick Wilson maintain a warm, winking bond in the face of demons. Yet the haunting chosen from the Warrens' trophy case of supernatural souvenirs isn't deserving. Basically it's an exorcism gig with working class British accents. Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) is a single Mum in a London flat with four children, one demonically possessed. That would be Janet (Madison Wolfe), a bright child when she isn't snarling. With the original The Conjuring and Insidious, Wan led a revival of old school horror values, visceral without being explicit. Now that those experiments in terror are bona fide franchises, he's toying with the retro format, not always successfully. The Conjuring 2 runs nearly 2 1/4 hours, uncommon for the genre, and a signal of its ambition. One uneasy example: Well into the possession stuff, a phonograph fails when the Hodgson family could use some music. Ed picks up a guitar, and Wilson does a decent Elvis impression, singing I Can't Help Falling in Love With You  all the way through. The scene ends, and viewers may wonder why it's there. Me too. Here's what I think: Wan wants us to think something frightful is about to happen, that Wilson's soothing voice will be suddenly interrupted by something REALLY SCARY. Then it isn't, and Wan thinks we'll laugh away tension, that really wasn't built. Nice idea, with slightly off execution. At least Wan tries something different. Not always, though. At times, The Conjuring 2 takes a MadLibs approach to terror, subbing a demonic nun and crotchety old corpse for what-have-you in the nightmare collection. Janet's possession is one head swivel and a vomit spray shy of Linda Blair's version. Wan is gradually remaking cliches of the cliches he resurrected to make two franchises possible. The Conjuring 2 is serviceable horror, heavy on the audio stings yet smarter than the average gorefest. That'll be enough to justify a Part 3, in which case I'd like to show Mr. Wan an interesting property in New York. Little town called Amityville ..."

After fine work serving up old-fashioned scares in ""The Conjuring,"" cowriter (with his ""Conjuring"" writers Carey & Chad Hayes and ""Orphan's"" David Johnson)/director James Wan (""Saw,"" ""Furious 7"") returns to the franchise with something akin to its unofficial prequel ""Annabelle."" While the basic outline of the real, still debated case can be found, the story's been tarted up to ridiculous degrees, any restraint found in the first film abandoned. Without once ever using the term 'poltergeist,' the film begins by establishing the stress the Hodgson family is under, notably mother Peggy who's struggling financially, and Janet, upset that her mom won't believe she wasn't really smoking at school. Their council flat in Enfield is an obvious condemnation candidate (here, anyway), its walls peeling and cracked, its basement a tributary of the Thames. Cinematographer Don Burgess (""Flight"") creates obvious pockets of impenetrable shadow in every room of the house, including the upstairs landing where the youngest Hodgson, Billy (Benjamin Haigh), has a teepee toy tent. (Speaking of toys, Wan repeats himself, using a 'Crooked Man' zoetrope whose animated man springs to life like a character out of ""Beetlejuice."") After stowing her homemade spirit board under her bed in the room she shares with elder sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Janet begins finding herself by the living room's old, cracked leather chair in the middle of the night. Then she begins to hear and project the voice of an old man who keeps claiming ownership of the home. When furniture begins to move of its own accord, the family flees to neighbors Peggy (Maria Doyle Kennedy, ""Sing Street"") and Vic Nottingham (Simon Delaney, ""Alan Partridge""). The police are called and witness the same, but state that the Hodgsons' problem is out of their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, back in Connecticut, Lorraine is panicking, the demon she'd seen in Amityville not only haunting her at home, but offering visions of Ed's death. (Daughter Judy (Sterling Jerins, ""The Conjuring"") is also imperiled, only to be completely forgotten.) When they're called upon to observe the Hodgsons before the Church will take action, she's reluctant, but Ed is undeterred - a family needs help! The Enfield case was investigated by not only the Warrens, but by the Society for Psychical Research's Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney, ""Magic in the Moonlight""), a believer, and professor of psychology Anita Gregory (Franka Potente, ""Run Lola Run""), a sceptic. Both fulfill their duties here, but with Wan's rendition of the Warrens on site, the situation spirals more into Tobe Hooper's ""Poltergeist"" than the Enfield story's, with an over-the-top climax part ""The Exorcist"" part ""The Perils of Pauline."" Lorraine, it should be noted, continually tells Ed she feels no presence in the Hodgson home, confirming Gregory's findings, then does an abrupt about face just in time for Wan's overkill. Farmiga and Wilson are both fine, instilling their characters with Christian values and courage, Wilson even acing a credible Elvis cover. Young Wolfe is quite good vacillating between scared young girl"

This exchange happens about three-fourths of the way through James Wan's histrionic sequel to his 2013 horror blockbuster hit, The Conjuring. It's one of a dozen seemingly meta contrivances that's repeatedly thrown at the audience as if the producers are literally begging them to ignore the (easily Googable) fact that the Warrens were full of shit.* Which is unfortunate because the whole ""based on a true story"" angle is not only well-worn territory, but also completely unnecessary in the Information Age. That gimmick may have worked wonders for, say, Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre way, way back in 1976, but that was because hunks in tight jeans weren't Wikiing cool movie facts with their lady friends and discovering that a.) Ed Gein was actually from the Midwest and b.) never used chainsaws. Yet here we are in 2016, where, unlike the gluttonous riches of indie horror, the mainstream fluff continues to lean on old tricks and stale treats. The Conjuring 2 could be the last gasp, though. Tired, worn-out, and spread thin, this second entry of what Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema are probably praying turns into a cinematic universe  more on that soon  contains absolutely nothing new to absorb. Creepy kids, violent possessions, old-timey toys, slamming doors, flooded basements, swirling furniture, gnarly old men, nu-metal demons, a Babadook knockoff, fast cuts, jump scares, and predictable callbacks haunt each and every scene of Wan's would-be epic. It's slick and stylish to the point of distraction. This isn't horror; this is exaggerated carnival fare. What's worse, Wan fumbles any goodwill he cultivated with its stellar predecessor. At least that film knew how to juggle the two storylines  the Warrens and Ron Livingston's nuclear family  and temper the extremities until the end. This time around, he goes tone-deaf, oscillating maniacally between clown shoes horror and perfume drama. Whenever the Warrens pop up, it's as if the projectionist pulled a fast one and switched to a Lifetime Movie of the Week, complete with the most saccharine score to pop up in a horror film in years. By the end, you'll wonder if the film itself was possessed ... yeah, it's that perverse. One of the problems, at least with regards to the story itself, is that there's simply too much going on. Even at a hefty 134 minutes, which is downright Apatowian for this genre, the sequel suffers an asthma attack as it huffs and puffs to touch upon every facet of what should be a straightforward ghost story. This is strange because, technically, the format hasn't changed one bit; in fact, Wan mimics the original beat for beat, swapping the Annabelle cold open for Amityville and the Perrons for the Hodgsons. The difference is two-fold: this one's 20 minutes longer and"
149,JCN_Doc9_The_Conjuring_2,JCN_Doc9_The_Conjuring_2,JCN,Horror,Positive,The_Conjuring_2,"Scaring the bejesus out of moviegoers is a delicate alchemy that is difficult to harness just once. An often unholy mixture of visual and aural cues, filmmakers can struggle to repeatedly summon that kind of dark magic. And for director James Wan, it could risk even becoming a simple formula after Saw, Insidious, and 2013's cinematic chokehold The Conjuring. Yet, The Conjuring 2 proves itself to be more than a worthy successor to the filmmaker's growing legacy of bumps in the night that actually cause you to sit up and take notice of your surroundings. For the sequel, Wan and company also have the added (and unenviable) task of following up his last chiller that was something of a cultural touchstone for anyone looking to scream at the multiplex. While there have been a number of great horror movies since 2013, most of them have emerged in the indie world. Generally, studio sponsored scares have meanwhile continued to emulate the kind of haunted house beats and creaks that Wan (and Blumhouse Productions) have made very familiar for those too young to recall Poltergeist or The Exorcist. But whereas most of the imitators are as mechanical as the rickety plots that connect their jump scares, Wan still proves to have a masterful touch for winding audiences up and getting them to hold their breath while his camera swoops and glides with calculated grace. Even if The Conjuring 2 is intrinsically similar to its forebearer's design, and consequently not quite as thrilling a ride, it still has shocks aplenty to beholdnot least of which is a surprising focus on the humans buried underneath all the well-timed boos. Ostensibly based on a true story, Conjuring 2 picks up mostly six years after the first film's events on a bewitched farmhouse in Rhode Island. Ed and Lorraine Warrenembodied by the still invaluable castings of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmigaare on something of an extended sabbatical. As revealed in the prologue, the Warrens wound up involved during the intervening years in one of the most infamous ""hauntings"" of the 20th century: ""the Amityville Horror."" But while this ghost story turned out to be a hoax in reality, in the film's world it was a nightmarish brush with the mouth of Hell for Lorraine, who found herself face to face with a demon that might have just followed her home. Hence their reluctance to get involved in any new cases by 1977. Still, as the Warrens tour the talk show circuit and face increased skepticism from academia about their findings, there is a family with serious problems across the Atlantic in Enfield (a borough on the northern outskirts of London). There, within a rundown council home, single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) is slowly realizing there is something very wrong. With barely enough money to make ends meet, she cannot even replace the furniture she and her husband inherited when they bought the houseand he has since walked out on the family.

The director's sense of cinematic fear was clearly formed by the horror films of the '70s and '80s, his work often recalling hits of the era like ""The Omen"" and ""Poltergeist."" In many ways, ""The Conjuring 2"" is the ""ultimate James Wan film,"" allowing the filmmaker to play with styles of the era in the retelling of one of its most notable paranormal activities: the notorious Enfield poltergeist. Being able to tie the ""true story"" behind another horror classic from his youth to this one (""The Amityville Horror"") only sweetens the deal. Wan is a kid in a haunted candy store with ""The Conjuring 2"" and his talent (and that of his team) make this kind of ride enjoyable, even if it doesn't have the visceral, confident impact of the original. ""The Conjuring 2"" opens with notorious ghostbusters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) investigating the aftermath of the murders that became known as ""The Amityville Horror."" Lorraine has a unique ability to communicate with supernatural beings and has been asked to confirm that what happened at Amityville was demonic in nature and not just a homicidal patriarch. While sitting around a table in the DeFeo dining room, Lorraine has an out-of-body experience that allows her to see the shotgun murders that took place in the house and a ""Demon Nun"" (Bonnie Aarons), which is literally how the recurring vision is listed in the credits, who will haunt Lorraine throughout the film, and issue a warning that Ed's days are numbered. After the Amityville prologue, the action jumps to Enfield, England (we know we're in England because Wan, never a particularly subtle director, uses ""London Calling"" on the soundtrack, an obvious choice more playful than annoying). We meet the Hodgson family, led by single mother Peggy (Frances O'Connor) and including four children. One of the girls is Janet (Madison Wolfe), and she starts to have much bigger problems at home than when she was caught smoking by her teacher. It begins with sleepwalking, progresses to sounds in the middle of the night, and ultimately ends up in possession. A man named Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian) seems to have the ability to take over the poor girl's body, even speaking through her, resulting in some infamous recordings in which a young girl sounds decidedly like an old man. And that's nowhere near as scary as the crosses that turn upside down or the visions of the ""Crooked Man."" The local authorities get in touch with the Warrens, who make the trip to England to determine whether or not the Hodgsons are faking the haunting or stop them from becoming the next Amityville. Children in jeopardy, a put-upon mother, an old house. Sound familiar? It should. Wan and his screenwriters very purposefully hit many of the same beats as the first film, presenting us with a set-up that often feels too similar, and disappoints by comparison because O'Connor's"
151,MWS_Doc1_Minority_Report,MWS_Doc1_Minority_Report,MWS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick's science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg's complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick's 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author's vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg's most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick's obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author's ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick's work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity's evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg's film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick's vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker. Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C.'s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the ""gifts"" of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs' foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn't been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton's personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorce, he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer's insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit"

This film marks the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. The film has audiences asking some important questions. What if we knew what was going to happen in the future? After you ask yourself the question, what if the person knowing this found out he was going to kill someone? This is the gist of the film, which is based on the Philip K. Dick short story. Another thing here is that the audience must be able to buy into the science early on in the film. This is key to being able to just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you're watching the film for the first time in 2020, the science is very believable. It's amazing how much of the science is catching up right in front of us. There's something to be said about the eye-dentification. Social media platforms already know our faces. Companies target us online because of internet cookies. One could look at author Philip K. Dick as a prophet in the world of science-fiction. In case you didn't know, Dick is also the man behind Blade Runner. One of the film's main themes is free will vs. determinism. The film handles this so beautifully. If we know our future, could we possibly do something to change it? The Department of PreCrime, at least in what we see on screen, is mostly focusing on preventing murders. This is where the three pre-cognitives are the main focus. Two twin males and one female share a common trait. They see the future and the visions appear on a giant screen. Together, they're able to see the future. They have no interaction with the outside world. The department's agents work to arrest people on the basis of the visions. PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has turned to drugs since his son, Sean, disappeared. Anderton is also separated from his wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris). Anderton just happens to have the unfortunate luck of being in the pre-cogs vision when DOJ agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is visiting the agency. Talk about bad luck! Anderton now goes on the run and PreCrime creator Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) tells him that Agatha (Samantha Morton) sometimes has a different vision. Dr. Hineman refers to this as a ""minority report."" There's a lot of mystery in the film surrounding the death of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper). She just happens to be Agatha's mother. The further we get into the film, Anderton learns that he's being framed. Meanwhile, Witwer starts studying the available footage and starts to believe the same. Anybody in the right mind would do what he does next. But what Witwer doesn't know is that the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), is covering up the murder.

It's a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in ""red ball"" situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion  since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy  and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog  the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy  one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated ""Blade Runner"" setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens  an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of ""Minority Report,"" which, for a Philip K.

154,MWS_Doc4_Minority_Report,MWS_Doc4_Minority_Report,MWS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is a busy film. It fills your eye and ear - and, even rarer, your mind. It speculates on the future and uses what it visualises to commentate on the present. Like its three ""pre-cogs"" - clairvoyant visionaries gifted with the power to foresee future events - it forewarns us of the shape of things to come - some of which are already here. The film's sheer timeliness is a great part of its importance. It's set in Washington DC, a metropolis whose murder rate has dropped to zero. Crimes are prevented before they can be committed - thanks to tapping into the pre-cogs' premonitions. But if the streets are safe, it's because the old watchword about the price of liberty being eternal vigilance has been given a sinister techno-twist. In Spielberg's futureworld, the price of liberty is eternal surveillance. For all its own impressive dystopian design and cyborg melodrama, a comparable film like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was light on the way the future is already impacting on the here and now. Minority Report, based on a brilliant extrapolation from Philip K Dick's SF novel, pulls together what we see happening already in a world where people have their identities ""stolen"", machines ""judge"" our entitlement to be believed or not, and incarceration is sanctioned on suspicion of what we may do, not what we have done. In A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kubrick foresaw the day a Minister of the Interior would brainwash criminals into subservience to the state and justify it because ""it works"". Spielberg's movie is the new, improved version of the proto-police state. It begins with what, for this director, is an uncommon kind of overture: sex and violence. Tom Cruise, head of the Pre-Crime Unit, stands on a podium. Before him, like instruments in an orchestra, are screens whose subliminal images, sourced from the clairvoyant pre-cogs, illustrate a crime passionel about to be committed. Like a conductor, Cruise waves his cybergloved hands accelerando in a race against time to pick 'n' mix the visual clues to the scene of the crime-to-be. This sequence alone crosses a new frontier in high-tech cinema. The airborne SWAT team, descending vertically on individual jet-propelled backpacks, make their arrest just before the jealous husband puts the knife in. He's whipped off to eternal hibernation, standing upright, to save space in prison. This prologue demo sets the stripcartoon style and pace of a movie that uses brainpower, not bubbles, to carry its message. Cruise is a flawed hero. His own child was abducted years before. The ""home movies"" he watches in his lonely high-rise home - actually images of ex-wife and lost child who ""materialise"" in his living-room in 3D - have a poignant melancholy suggestive of the loss of other values once real and dear to its citizens. Cruise's loss of his son is what motivates him to fight crime. Not for the first time in a Spielberg film, the violated family echoes the director's own childhood"

The best thing about it is pretty much everything else. After his unhappy fathomings of the future with ""A.I.,"" Spielberg has plunged back in and fished up something rich and strange. ""Minority Report"" is set in the year 2054, and Spielberg, who knows better than anyone how to knead the homely into the exotic, is careful to suggest that, for every shift in social mores, other details have stayed the same. Businessmen still wear a suit and tie to the office; policemen, on the other hand, race toward trouble spots not in a wailing squad car but in the belly of a giant hair dryer. The idea, one presumes, is that any terrified suspects can be rapidly coiffed into submission, but that is the least of their worries. What really gets to them is Precrime. This is the flourishing, psychojudicial field in which John Anderton (Tom Cruise) currently toils and spins. The premise is simple, in the way that eugenics was simple: the stateor, rather, Washington, D.C., where the scheme is under trial before it goes national is now able to unearth a murder before it happens, and so prevent it from coming to pass. The authorities get the names of the perpetrator and the victim; thus equipped, they merely have to work out the location, hop into the hair dryer, and trust that they make it in time. Such are the conditions of the opening sequence, which lasts a good twenty minutes, and which reminds us that, when it comes to stepping on the gas of a plot, Spielberg can still summon the contagious excitement of a young buck. Yet the texture of the material here could hardly be more grownup; to see a Spielberg film that starts with both sex and violence, as ""Minority Report"" does, is one of the more unexpected events in a moviegoer's life, like coming across a tea party in the middle of late Peckinpah. Knowing the hook of ""Minority Report,"" I was bracing myself for topical nods toward the issue of genetic predisposition; it doesn't seem too unlikely that, half a century on, scientists will be capable of separating those members of the community destined for homicide from those whose DNA has programmed them to commit home baking instead. In the event, we get the Pre-Cognitives. They may sound like an angry British rock combo, but they are in fact three swimsuited human figures of mysterious origin who lie in a flotation tank and deliver their visions of upcoming horror, which are then transferred, or bootlegged, onto the screens of Precrime. In short, Spielberg is propping up his future with a relic of the past: the Pre-Cogsnotably the most intense of the trio, Agatha (Samantha Morton)are just doing what the Oracle did at Delphi or the Sibyl at Cumae. What Spielberg gets from them, however, is the promise of suspense, and that is what he treasures most; this new"

So I thought I'd re-up this piece from my old blog. It's 11 years old, but still accurate. After watching Minority Report last night, I was surprised to discover that most critics do not consider it to be an utter and complete piece of crap. Roger Ebert, in particular, had an absolutely gushing review, in which he praised the film for being ""a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit."" Ebert is by all accounts a lovely human being, but every time I read something by him, I am reminded that he does not have the critical sense that God gave a roach. Even an insect that frolics in filth would be hard pressed to find any enjoyment in such a shiny, treacly, turkey of a film. Spielberg as director has found perhaps the perfect outlet for his glibness in this tale of precognitive saviors. The film grinds frictionlessly along, a remorselessly predictable blueprint for itself. Flawed hero, tragic backstory, clever chase scene, cleverer chase scene, cleverest chase scene, false antagonist, twist, real antagonist, reconciliation with perfectly domestic yet also spunky wife. Like the precogs, we can see it all coming and all going too; painful echoes of sentiment past sliding down our brainstems as we float weightlessly in an infinite vat of sentimental horseshit. The emotional core of the film is (you could predict it) the tragic backstory I mentioned. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a efficient no-nonsense police guy in the precrime unit, snooping out murders before they happen. Beneath his gruff exterior and Hollywood good looks, though, lurks a sadness; his 5-year old disappeared from a public pool. Anderton's marriage collapsed, and now he takes drugs (ooooh...dark) and watches 3-D home movies of his son and wife. His heart is tugged while watching them and our heart is tugged while watching him; it's a testament to the power of film and to ""complex human feelings"", in Ebert's words. Said complex human feelings being: hey, losing a kid  that really sucks. If that happens to you, you've got to be deep, right? That is the extent of the film's character development; Anderton has no other discernible personality traits; nor does his wife. The film's stupid, by-the-numbers plot, it's utterly facile and familiar characters, are all supposed to be redeemed by dropping a murdered five-year old onto them from a great height. Before I had a kid myself, I found this sort of mindless, self-serving manipulation unpleasant. Now that I have a child of my own, who is actually a person rather than a trope, I find it even more detestable. At the end of the film, Anderton indignantly yells at his stupid standard-issue corrupt boss for manipulating his love for his child. Rarely have I seen a moment of such utterly clueless hypocrisy.

157,MWS_Doc7_Minority_Report,MWS_Doc7_Minority_Report,MWS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Minority Report , directed by Steven Spielberg, screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick Minority Report is the latest film directed by Steven Spielberg. In the year 2054 murder has been eliminated in Washington DC through the use of a team of psychics who infallibly foresee killings. The would-be murderers are apprehended before they commit their crimes and sent to cryogenic freezing units. When the leading figure in the ""Pre-Crime Unit,"" John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is named as the future killer of a man he does not know, he sets out to unravel the mystery, with his own police force hot on his trail. Anderton's own son was abducted and presumably murdered some years before, an event that also shattered his marriage. Spielberg is one of the more gifted members of a generation of studio filmmakers whose output in general has been exceedingly poor and forgettable. He has the undoubted ability to narrate a drama effectively, to hold the spectator's attention and to develop a theme. His themes, however, tend to revolve around the concerns of his generation of upper middle class Americans. It is surely notable that in a filmmaking career spanning thirty tumultuous years, Spielberg, whose personal wealth reportedly exceeds $2 billion, has not once weighed in tellingly on the state of American society. Minority Report, based on a 1956 short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, has intriguing and entertaining elements. No expense has been spared. The filmmakers have thought up all manner of ingenious devices, combining the retrograde and the futuristic, to create the world of 2054. However, as is nearly always the case in contemporary science fiction, the imagination has only been set to work on ""things,"" not relations between people, not social life. There are absurdities in Minority Report which reveal a great deal about the social assumptions and prejudices of its creators. The American society of half a century from now is presented as generally prosperous and content, insofar as one is able to determine, but crime and murder (and drug use) persist. Why? Is there no connection between poverty and violent behavior, or, more generally, between social reality and crime? The filmmakers are either adapting to themselves to the right-wing argument that crime is essentially causeless (rooted in Man's fallen state) or, probably more to the point, indicating their lack of interest in its causes and a concern merely with the means of avoiding its consequences. The discovery that the psychics do not always agree, that there are suppressed ""minority reports,"" suggesting other possible outcomes, is the turning point in Spielberg's film. The Pre-Crime Unit may, in fact, be seizing and incarcerating those who were never going to commit any offenses. Anderton finds out for himself the complex relationship between the apparently inevitable and the actual manner in which events play themselves out. One can only respond: thank heavens for small mercies. Steven Spielberg and company do not, in the end,"
158,MWS_Doc8_Minority_Report,MWS_Doc8_Minority_Report,MWS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"Once again this year we are graced with a futuristic sci-fi flick based on a short story by the visionary Philip Dick, this time in the form of ""Minority Report"", which poses the intriguing hypothesis: What if we could see into the future and arrest people before they commit a murder, or any other crime for that matter? Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as ""Pre-Cogs"" who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are ""set"" to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this ""perfect"" system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let's face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he's innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Minority Report"" reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg's last futuristic foray, ""A.I."", a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski's artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning  those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect. Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise's energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha's Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha  tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (""Dune"", ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Exorcist"") steps in as Anderton's superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protege Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who"

The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter. There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be"
160,MWS_Doc10_Minority_Report,MWS_Doc10_Minority_Report,MWS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report,"In Minority Report, a futuristic thriller set in 2054, murder has been eliminated in Washington DC thanks to a division of law enforcement known as Precrime. Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers. Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities. Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future. As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!"" Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication"

Adapted (loosely) from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons's gleefully brutal 2012 comic book The Secret Service with in-your-face visual bravado by Matthew Vaughn (who also turned Millar's Kick-Ass into a similarly deranged and beautiful killfest), this tale of a young tough getting introduced into a clandestine espionage network takes a familiar setup and upends it with comically stylized brutality. The film knows its story is an obvious one. ""Have you seen Trading Places, Nikita, Pretty Woman?"" Colin Firth's Harry Hart (code name: Galahad) asks our hero Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a council estate kid with a chip on his shoulder. Eggsy hasn't heard of those films, but he has heard of My Fair Lady, one of Kingsman's less intuitive reference points. Due to a long-ago incident that left Eggsy's father dead, Harry has been waiting for the opportunity to try and turn the troubled young man into a Kingsman  a secret group of international super-spies formed out of a centuries-old order of tailors. The Kingsmen are run out of a Savile Row shop, and they pay as much attention to their bespoke suits and fine Scotch as they do to their elaborate gadgets and bulletproof umbrellas  they're a fantasy of weaponized Englishness. Most of Kingsman's story involves Eggsy and several other young initiates' attempts to make it through the order's intense training program, at the end of which only one of them will be allowed to join. There is a ticking clock, however: Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a colorful internet-billionaire-cum-climate-change-doomsayer, is going around the world hatching an evil plot that involves kidnapping celebrities and politicians while giving everybody free SIM cards that may or may not have some mind-altering properties. We're not sure what Valentine's ultimate aim is, but he's clearly up to no good: He can't stand the sight of violence, so his dirty work is done by the young, lithe Gazelle (Algerian actress Sofia Boutella), who has deadly, razor-sharp blades instead of feet and who already killed one of the Kingsmen in the film's opening scenes. More than any other director, Vaughn (who also made the well-liked X-Men: First Class) has found a cinematic analogue for the intricacy of the comic-book page. Kingsman is full of elaborately orchestrated violence and acrobatic stunt work, shot in fast, sinewy, CGI-enhanced long takes that push and pull our perspective this way and that. It's all very silly and not really meant to be taken seriously, but as the story gets more and more brutal, something strange happens: We start to care for these cartoonish characters and this absurd scenario. A similar thing happened in Kick-Ass: the film's willingness to kill off key characters, to send the story spinning off in ever-darker directions, all the while not letting up on its cheekiness, made us think anything was possible  that a crazy person"
162,PLW_Doc2_Kingsman__The_Secret_Service,PLW_Doc2_Kingsman__The_Secret_Service,PLW,Action,Positive,Kingsman__The_Secret_Service,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" starring a natty Colin Firth, a newbie Taron Egerton and a naughty Samuel L. Jackson, is a dry, wry sendup of the 007 world, which is itself a sly, dry sendup of the spy game. Directed by ""Kick-Ass"" action specialist Matthew Vaughn with slightly more vigor than necessary and a shade less restraint than needed, it's a bit too too to be ""brilliant,"" as the Brits say. But it's not half bad either. Based on a comic book  isn't everything these days?  the idea spun from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' ""The Secret Service"" is as rich with possibilities as the spy genre is for spoofing. So is the bizarre weaponry, always good for a laugh in ""Kingsman,"" from basics like a lethal fountain pen or cigarette lighter/hand grenade to the exotic Oscar Pistorius-style racing blades of one sultry Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) that can slice a man in half in mere seconds. Unlike the fire power, foot power and fisticuffs, however, the script doesn't always hit its mark. Still, the screenplay by Vaughn and Jane Goldman (""Stardust"") is at times wickedly witty, having fun not just with spies but the British obsession with social class. If you can forgive the failings for at least some of the two-plus-hour running time, ""Kingsman"" serves up its share of entertaining froth. Much of that is due to Firth, the film's true star. The Oscar-winning actor, who tends to be equally engaging in comedy and drama, plays the most revered Kingsman, Harry Hart, code name Galahad. Firth, displaying a charming bravado, genuinely seems to be having the time of his life playing a well-turned-out action hero. In keeping with Knights of the Round Table code names, the Secret Service's leader is Arthur (Michael Caine). The villain is Valentine (Jackson), a mega-billionaire obsessed with global warming and old movies, which seem to be his reference point for all things. Seeded through the film, it's a conceit that movie buffs will likely enjoy. Valentine has a nefarious ""solution"" for the planet's temperature problems that involves free SIM cards implanted in the populace so the world can text and talk as much as its wants. And he can rid the world of its texters and talkers when he wants. There are few actors who can walk the bad guy/funny guy tightrope with quite the aplomb of Jackson. Every time the actor shows up in the midst of the mayhem of ""Kingsman,"" he never fails to dole out a little comic relief. Gazelle is his girlfriend, bodyguard and No. 1 warrior. The special effects used to allow the actress to spin, slice and dice any adversary with those prosthetic running blades is quite amazing, though whether it represents a step forward for people with disabilities or not is a tough call. (Boutella is not disabled herself.) Like Bond, ""Kingsman"" is British-suave, from its agents' tailored suits to its machine-gun-quality bumper shoots. It begins with a mission gone wrong. An agent, whose lower-class"

The truly shocking movie opening this weekend is Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service, a hyper-violent live-action cartoon about a dapper British intelligence agency stopping Samuel L. Jackson from killing almost everyone on the planet. It's a comedy, and it's a funny one, but if you're squeamish about senseless death and bright-hued gore, you might want to steer clear. Like Vaughn's teeny-bop killfest Kick-Ass, Kingsman is a riot of crunching, gnarly violence that's meant to shock the system into a kind of giddy hysteria. And it works! Well, it worked on me, anyway. Kingsman has a spastic verve that turns what could otherwise be gratuitous and rude into an act of spunky bravado, like it's making good on a dare. I'm surprised they got away with some of it. Which isn't, I hope, to oversell what is in other ways a fairly straightforward action-comedy. While Kingsman has flair for days, it's also a traditionally entertaining secret-agent caper, coupled with a training/academy narrative that's vaguely reminiscent of Top Gun or G.I. Jane or any of the myriad other movies about tough folks getting even tougher. The film stars newcomer Taron Egerton as a chav-y street kid named Eggsy, raised by a single mum and her string of lousy boyfriends, now messing around and doing petty crime in his scrubby corner of London. Eggsy is smart and physically capablea former gymnast and Royal Marines drop-outbut he's resigned to his lot in life as a parkouring ruffian, ears studded and polo buttoned all the way up. That is until he meets Harry Hart (Colin Firth), who tells Eggsy that his late father was one of the Kingsmen, a noble secret order of international spies devoted to protecting crown and country, and the rest of the world. Though the Kingsmen are usually of high birth, Harry, known as Galahad in this Arthurian-themed murderers club, wants to give Eggsy a shot. Attracted to the snappy suits and exploding gadgets, Eggsy says f--k yeah. Meanwhile, an evil scheme is being enacted by Jackson's villain, Valentine, a tech zillionaire who dresses like Spike Lee (or is it Russell Simmons?) but talks like the worst Silicon Valley libertarian imaginable. While Eggsy trains, Valentine goes about his wicked business, it only being a matter of time before they have their big showdown. Before the movie gets to that madcap climax, it takes us on a rollicking tour of Vaughn's wacky, warped mind, eye-popping action mixing with bent humor. Firth upends our notions of his Firthiness by kicking a lot of ass, while Egerton swaggers around with an abundance of charm. Those of you who harbor a dark affection for that particular kind of British swagger, all Cockney and track-jacketed, will find much to enjoy in the dangerously cute Egerton. And then there's all that violence, which Vaughn stages with wicked humor; it's the kind of stuff that elicits a half-guffaw, half-gasp of surprise. There are bloodier, more violent movies out there, for sure, but"

Co-written and directed by Matthew Vaughn. 129 minutes. At GTA theatres. 14A. It's been a long time, since we've seen an action hero  The Avengers John Steed in the swinging '60s  wield an umbrella for anything other than warding off the wet stuff. Then there's Gazelle, clearly inspired by James Bond movies of decades past, a supervillain hench-wench who uses her super-sharpened blade runner prosthetic legs to slice and dice with lethal efficiency. But just when you've got Kingsman: The Secret Service pegged as an homage to the campy spy thrillers of yesteryear, director Matthew Vaughn, who co-wrote the screenplay, takes the film to some unexpected places. Sure our hero gets the girl in the end. But in Kingsman, you're never going to guess exactly how it's going to happen. One of the best things about the film  based on the 2012 comic series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons  is how thoroughly and gleefully Vaughn revels in subverting the form and conventions of the genre. Yes, there are scenes that feel clunky, and much of the dialogue certainly could have upped its wit and banter quotient. And at nearly two hours and 10 minutes, the film occasionally tries one's patience. But there's enough action, suspense and all-around fun to make Kingsman: The Secret Service an unexpectedly enjoyable ride. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The film opens with a bit of necessary back story involving the death of a Kingsman agent during a Middle East misadventure before arriving in the present day with Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad seeking to recruit the dead agent's son into the super-secret ""independent international intelligence agency."" That turns out to be Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, a lower-middle class no-account (played by Taron Egerton) who's only discernible skills appear to be pickpocketing and driving backward at high speed. At the same time Eggsy is competing with a cadre of upper-middle class toffs for a coveted spot at the agency, supervillain Richmond Valentine is hatching a plot to save the Earth from the effects of climate change and the virus that threatens to destroy humanity. It's a pleasure to see Samuel L. Jackson dial down the volume, portraying Valentine with a comically over-the-top lisp, a villain who plots mayhem on a global scale but has no stomach for violence. The reliably watchable Colin Firth is both Savile Row suave and in trim fighting form as Galahad. He needs to be since the role requires two very energetic action scenes. Vaughn has done well in casting relative newcomer Egerton (who bears a resemblance to Ewan McGregor) as Eggsy. He's not too obviously good-looking, and he manages to convey the protagonist's personal growth as he graduates from sneering callow youth to budding superspy. Providing solid backup is Mark Strong playing Merlin (the Bond equivalent of gadget master, Q) with a Scottish burr and Michael Caine in his umpteenth-and-counting role as spy chief Arthur. Vaughn has constructed some dazzling and memorable action scenes,"

With a cast that includes Colin Firth and Michael Caine, and concerns James Bond-inspired intrigue and action, you think, ah, a posh British action comedy. Characters speaking the Queen's English (or ""The King's Speech""), the occasional comic-action set piece, all that, eh what? Smashing. Nope. The thing to remember about ""Kingsman"" is that it's directed by Matthew Vaughn, who also directed ""Kick-Ass."" He got a lot of mileage out of that graphic-novel adaptation (as is this) by shocking us with, for instance, an adorable young girl slicing up bad guys and cursing like a stevedore while doing so. It was anachronistic and bizarre and really entertaining, if you were willing to give yourself to it. (The sequel, not so much.) That same dichotomy of expectation means it'll take you awhile to reset what you thought you were in for, but you won't have long to do so: A man is sliced right down the middle five minutes into it. (This is not a spoiler. So many appendages and heads and whatever else are separated from their bodies that you quickly lose count.) The trick, of course, is in the numbers. Kill one person in a film and you've personalized the experience. It means something. It affects you. Explode heads by the dozens, if not hundreds, in a rainbow-colored shower of fireworks and classical music and you enter the realm of the absurd, which is where Vaughn works best. Firth plays Harry Hart, whose code name is Galahad. He's a member of a super-secret group of elite spies who operate out of a swank Saville Row menswear shop. They operate beyond the purview of any government and the attendant red tape, instead taking their cues from the Knights of the Roundtable (thus the code names). They're gentlemen, you see, but lethal in the extreme when foiling the bad guys. The film begins with a botched mission that costs one of the knights his life. Seventeen years later, his son Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is just a step above a street kid who gets into trouble, calls the number on the back of a coin Galahad gave him when his father died and the next thing you know, Eggsy is competing against others for a spot among the secret service. As he's enduring training and competition, insane billionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, lisping for all he's worth) is plotting a far-fetched culling of the population that involves deadly violence (obviously), but whose most ridiculous element is Valentine's offer of free cellphone and Internet service to the world. There's a scene in which Valentine invites Galahad to dinner, and they engage in an I-know-you-know-and-you-know-I-know conversation that revolves around their shared love of early James Bond movies (before they got so serious).

Obviously, the decision to imply more than display has served the producers for more than a half-century, but can you imagine what it would be like if a Bond film were to include all the seamier elements that they have only hinted at in the past? The early word on the over-the-top action-comedy ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" seemed to suggest that it would pay homage to the Bond films of oldthe ones made before the series took its turn towards the comparatively serious with the arrival of Daniel Craigwhile including all the Good Parts that had been largely absent in the past. Alas, it seems to have taken its inspiration from one of the lesser Roger Moore efforts than the classic Connerys and the result is a fitfully amusing but increasing tedious and occasionally appalling mess that plays like ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" with ridiculous amounts of gore and severed limbs on display, though the nipples this time around are not so much superfluous as they are distressingly nonexistent. Based on the comic book from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, ""Kingsman"" posits a top secret British espionage group that is inspired by King Arthur and his knights (whose names the members appropriate for their code names), based in a seemingly ordinary Savile Row tailor shop and regularly saves the world without getting into all the political mumbo-jumbo that has affected the efforts of governmental spy organizations. Having lost their Lancelot after a one-man effort to rescue a kidnapped scientist (Mark Hamill), the group begins the process of recruiting a replacement and for his nominee, agent Harry ""Galahad"" Hart (Colin Firth) puts up Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton), a seemingly ordinary young punk who lives with his mother and her abusive boyfriend and spends his days getting into dumb trouble. However, Eggsy is also the son of a former Kingsman who gave his life to save Harry and others when he was just a child. Not surprisingly, Eggsy seems out of place among the far more sophisticated other candidatesonly Roxy (Sophie Cookson) shows him any kindness or respectand Kingsman leader Arthur (Michael Caine) expects him to wash out quickly. Also not surprisingly, Eggsy manages to last throughout the extended testing process designed to winnow the group down to one under the eye of Merlin (Mark Strong). This turns out to be slightly more intense than, say, the executive training program at Harrodstheir barracks are quickly flooded while they sleep one night, there is a group skydive where they are informed that one of them is not packing a chute only after they make the jump and they are each given a puppy to raise and train.

Casting Colin Firth as a lethal gentleman super-spy and stranding him without elegant derring-do is like catching lightning in a bottle, then opening the stopper and letting it flash out. Firth plays Harry Hart, code name Galahad, a member of an independent British secret service that patterns itself on King Arthur's Round Table. (Michael Caine plays the chief, code name Arthur.) Firth is focused, trim, primed for action. In what passes for a master movie strategy, audiences 25 and up are meant to smile at seeing their beloved humanist star take down a pub-full of thugs and mow through a mob of addled fundamentalists. Audiences from 17 to 24 (the movie is R-rated) are led to identify with Galahad's protege, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton), a bright, strong, goodhearted lout from a North West London housing project. Eggsy is the son of a Kingsman agent who died to save a handful of comrades, including Harry. The agent takes on the lad as a cause, hoping to honor the debt to his dad and to prove that the agency should reinvigorate itself with proletarian blood. In one of the film's scattered semi-funny riffs, Harry asks Eggsy whether he knows Trading Places, La Femme Nikita, or Pretty Woman. The answer is nobut Eggsy does know My Fair Lady. I preferred it when Firth's hyper-rational magician played Henry Higgins to Emma Stone's psychic Eliza Doolittle in Magic in the Moonlight. In Kingsman, writer-director Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman don't summon the finesse to bring off high-style espionage or the primal pep to make over-the-top action scenes build and then pay off in shocked laughter and thrills (they're aiming for that combination). The Kingsman headquarters is a Savile Row tailor shop, and the idea of the agency producing gentlemen spies is reduced to bulletproof bespoke suits and tricked-out umbrellas, watches, and signet rings. The only bit of business that's remotely charming or memorable is Harry using an umbrella handle as a sling to turn a beer glass into a shot glass. A few straightforward scenes promise to be palate cleansers, like Eggsy using gymnastic skills to clamber up, down, and over project rooftops while escaping from a gang of knuckleheads. But even that simple piece of action falls short of the exhilarating get-up-and-go of similar parkour scenes in numerous modest action films (including Paul Walker's fleet-footed swan song, Brick Mansions). Though cinematographer George Richmond executes intricate, sweeping camera moves, the movie feels sour and slaphappy. Instead of wit, we get strained, sadistic jokiness. Samuel L. Jackson uses a theatrical lisp to portray a billionaire digital pioneer named Richmond Valentine, while his female assistant/assassin, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), employs her razor-sharp prosthetic feet to slice away at their adversaries. (Vaughn says he came up with the gimmick before the Oscar Pistorius scandal.) If Vaughn had a surer hand with performers and an ease at shifting tones, Jackson's"

It asks to be taken seriously, then turns ridiculous, then brings out the horn section to indicate the hoped-for triumph of good, then shows people's heads exploding in a CGI sequence intended to be funny. It tries to get by on charm, and like a lot of movies, and people who make that attempt, ""Kingsman"" does have charm  just not enough. It tells a story involving a society of secret agents that operates out of a high-end London tailor shop, and it must be noted that, even though the movie opens in 1997, Colin Firth does not once appear in the baggy trousers of that era. From the beginning, he wears the more form fitting, skinny-legged pants common to today, probably because Firth knows he looks good in them. Let's just say it, that man can wear a suit. A riff on British spy movies, it stars Firth as Harry, who is asked by his leader  Michael Caine, of course  to find a potential recruit to replenish their ranks. Harry decides on the son of the man who saved his life years before. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is a working-class kid with no prospects, a horrible home life and nothing to lose. The movie's depiction of working-class despair is committed. It's about the only thing that director Matthew Vaughn doesn't regard as funny. ""Kingsman"" shows characters discussing spy movies and deciding what about their present circumstances is and isn't like a James Bond picture. At the same time, Vaughn hits most of the familiar stations of a Bond movie, including the introduction of gadgets in the first hour that get used in the second. Vaughn co-wrote and directed ""Kick-Ass,"" and perhaps the looseness and outrageousness of that earlier film  the way it satisfied genre conventions, even while tweaking and satirizing them  is what Vaughn was trying to do here. But this is the first time that Vaughn (""Layer Cake,"" ""Stardust"") has lost control of his story. Long before it ends, the movie has already started to feel like a long stunt, a genre parody for the sake of itself, with no larger comment or insight to offer. Samuel Jackson shows up as a criminal mastermind, a technology mogul who schemes to kill a billion people, but is too delicate to witness the violence he creates. Jackson plays him with an exaggerated lisp that goes in and out, in a performance that's too silly for the movie's more serious sections, involving murder. Though at first Harry and the new recruit's burgeoning father-son relationship seems to be at the core of the film's purpose, there really is nothing in ""Kingsman"" to ground it in anything like real emotion. It tries to hold us through scale and outlandishness, and yet every time the script springs a surprise on us, it's always for the worse, with things happening that either wouldn't or really shouldn't. But here's the"
169,PLW_Doc9_Kingsman__The_Secret_Service,PLW_Doc9_Kingsman__The_Secret_Service,PLW,Action,Negative,Kingsman__The_Secret_Service,"Silly, sadistic and finally a little galling, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" answers the question: What would Colin Firth have been like if he'd played James Bond? With faint traces of boredom in his eyes, Firth portrays one of the crack gentlemen-spies working for a supersecret and extraordinarily well-funded agency out to save the world from a crackpot billionaire philanthropist (Samuel L. Jackson, with a wee lisp and a plan to destroy the human species). As Firth's beautifully tailored colleagues, Michael Caine and Mark Strong offer unblinking gazes par excellence. And in the leading role, Welsh newcomer Taron Egerton is engaging as the working-class miscreant ""Eggsy,"" recruited by Firth's Harry Hart to join the Kingsman cadre. It's a family thing; Eggsy's father was a Kingsman, now deceased. And there's your plot summary. If you don't like the way the action's handled in an action movie, you are in trouble, and that's where I was with ""Kingsman"" from the moment a metal-footed henchwoman (Sofia Boutella) scissor-kicked through the air and sliced an adversary in half. Those pulled into the theater based on vague marketing promises of a classy espionage lark starring familiar English faces may wonder what hit them. Based on the 2012 graphic novel ""The Secret Service"" by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, director Matthew Vaughn's picture will appeal to anyone who enjoyed Vaughn's earlier ""Kick-Ass."" I didn't. I find the jocularity of Vaughn's gamer-style violence a drag. The sudden slo-mo; the flurry of anonymous kills, painlessly brutal but cumulatively numbing: After an hour I wanted some visual clarity and something more than a few jokes about the tropes of the spy movie genre. At one point Firth and Jackson talk about their love of the old Bond pictures and the necessity of a strong villain. It's good for a laugh, but it's a dead-end laugh; when it's over, you're stuck with ""Kingsman"" again. Vaughn's visual approach is to approximate the outlandish physicality of what's possible within a graphic novel fantasy on paper. I will say this: ""Kingsman"" has some nerve, however misguided. It kills off a major character, and as part of the young, hot recruits' deadly audition for the agency, they're asked to kill the puppies (kill the puppies!) they've been charged with overseeing for months. There's a scene set in ""KENTUCKY, U.S.A.,"" as the helpful title card informs us, in which a brainwashed Firth murders a hundred or so white supremacists at a church. And get this: There's a fleeting shot of President Barack Obama's head exploding (seen from the rear), along with various other politicians' and celebrities' heads, after the psycho-billionaire's plan gets underway. Let's take that as a shoutout to the exploding-head bit in ""The Interview"" that caused so much fuss lately. If Kim Jong Un is still miffed about that movie, perhaps he'll take solace in ""Kingsman."" As different as they are, both movies offer roughly the same entertainment value. Which is to say: some. Not enough."

That's the gap the Mark Millar/Dave Gibbons comic ""The Secret Service"" leaped into, and it's territory that feels most at home in the film from that comic, ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" Often, it's a droll riff on spy movies and what ""makes a gentleman,"" fine tailored (bespoke) suits and the clash of classes evident by the posh accents the movies so often attach to British secret agents. But almost as often it's an atonal, hyper-violent action comedy that goes on too long, tries far too hard, spills far too much blood and relies more than it should on Samuel L. Jackson's character's lisp for laughs. A super secret spy agency, privately financed, is run out of a British tailor's shop. They're not numbered, MI-6 style, but given names from Camelot  Lancelot, Galahad, Arthur. When one of their number is killed, Galahad (Colin Firth) gives a medal to the fallen man's son, promising him one big ""favor."" If the kid, who grows up street tough, bullied in a troubled home, ever finds himself in over his head, call this phone number. The ""service"" will get him out of his fix. That's how Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, falls in with the men of Kingsman. Much of the movie is a sluggish set-up  Eggy's recruitment, training for ""the most dangerous job interview in the world,"" attempts to fit in with the Oxford/Cambridge men (and women) who comprise this private secret service. Michael Caine is ""Arthur,"" who runs the show, Mark Strong is the Scottish fixer/gadget guru, Merlin. Samuel L. shows up as a billionaire environmental activist, wearing a grin, an assortment of NY Yankees hats (worn askew) and a speech impediment. ""Tho thorry you had to deal with this...unpleathanneth!"" If you've ever seen the least of the Bond films, ""Moonraker,"" the plot will seem familiar. Famous personages are disappearing, then reappearing, and the eco-fanatic supervillain, who speaks of himself in movie super villain terms, may be behind it. Yes, it's one of those spoofs where characters say stuff about what happens in a ""typical"" spy movie  the drinks served, the elaborately planned murders, the give-the-whole-plot away speeches the villain makes before those murders. Hilarious. And not even remotely novel. Director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn (""Kick Ass"") doesn't turn the genre conventions on their ear so much as celebrate them. Sofia Boutella plays a colorless yet deadly assistant to the billionaire, a kick boxer with curved sword blades for feet. Firth wears his suits impeccably, sips his whisky impeccably and purrs his posh-accented lines most impeccably of all. ""Manners maketh man,"" Galahad says gallantly, quoting a 16th century head of the exclusive Eton prep school. Firth makes a fine case for the James Bond he could have been, edited into action heroics worthy of JB (""James Bond? Jason Bourne? Jack Bauer?""). Strong does yeoman's work in support, but the young lead  adept at parkour and slinging that Cockney"
171,PYC_Doc1_Oblivion,PYC_Doc1_Oblivion,PYC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Science fiction is always more about the present, and even the past, than it is about the future, which by definition we don't know anything about. That's certainly true of ""Oblivion,"" the sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me  and many other people, I suspect  to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski. In fact, on some bizarre level ""Oblivion"" feels like a more grown-up and vastly improved version of Kosinski's murky and ludicrous ""TRON: Legacy,"" a movie I compared to sticking your head into a barrel of ink full of fluorescent glow-sticks. Like that movie, ""Oblivion"" incorporates all sorts of themes, ideas and images from science-fiction cinema of the last several decades, including ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Solaris,"" among others. It explores nearly the same territory of loss, loneliness and rediscovery, but the philosophical veneer and the reverent design aesthetic fit a whole lot better when the whole story doesn't take place inside a 1980s video game. I'm sure some people will see ""Oblivion"" as another Philip K. Dick rehash -- to be clear, it's not based on any of his material -- but to my mind Kosinski and co-writers Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt have synthesized all these influences into a witty and elegant post-apocalyptic parable that's well suited to our age of asymmetrical warfare and even asymmetrical reality. (One could indeed steer a discussion of ""Oblivion"" toward a discussion of the limits of political knowledge and global understanding  but not before you've seen the movie.) We begin on, or just above, the surface of an abandoned and nearly dead planet, which happens to be our beloved third rock from the sun. It's the 2070s, and Jack (Cruise), our hero, explains in an opening voice-over that some years earlier the human race fought a total war against an alien race known as the Scavs. These invaders had first blown up the Moon  and indeed we can see it, a horizontal streak of rubble across the sky -- wreaking havoc with the tides and immensely destructive changes in the climate. While the Scav invasion was eventually repelled, the victory required the use of most of Earth's nuclear arsenal, leaving most of the planet uninhabitable. Most surviving humans have apparently been airlifted to a gigantic triangular spacecraft called the Tet, where they await evacuation to Titan, Saturn's largest moon, to begin a new civilization. Jack and Victoria (the chilly, leggy Andrea Riseborough), who's both his co-worker and his sexual partner, are technicians posted to a sleek, chic sky-pod that doubles as command center and living quarters  think Le Corbusier plus a 1979 layout from Architectural Digest plus Playboy magazine  mounted on a pole a few hundred meters above the Earth's surface. They're only there on a short-term assignment, mostly to monitor and repair the drones who hunt down bands of surviving Scavs and protect the giant nuclear reactors that"
172,PYC_Doc2_Oblivion,PYC_Doc2_Oblivion,PYC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Since his questionable comments and ill advised sofasaults on Oprah, Tom Cruise has become an actor that many people love to hate. But those things are in the past and as wacky as they were they still didn't effect the level of his onscreen work. He's a talented actor who throughout his career has tackled a wide variety of roles in iconic 80's cheesefests, stirring and emotional dramas, big budgeted franchises, and even sci-fi thrillers. Now he returns to the science fiction genre in ""Oblivion"", a much more direct and vast sci-fi picture than Cruise's other efforts. ""Oblivion"" is co-written and directed by Joseph Kosinski, the man behind Disney's $400 million money maker ""Tron: Legacy"". Disney originally purchased the rights to ""Oblivion"" in hopes of repeating Tron's success but later relinquished the rights. It was quickly gobbled up by Universal Studios with Tom Cruise and Jessica Chastain set to star in the picture. Chastain would eventually drop out for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" with Olga Kurylenko replacing her. The movie is based on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel and was given an ambitious $120 million budget. I have to say I was really excited for ""Oblivion""even though the studio was very cryptic in regards to the film's details. That's a good approach to take because I found that the less you know going in the more effective the story will be. And for me it was quite effective. ""Oblivion"" doesn't fall into the category of a science fiction masterpiece but thanks to its visionary conception, stunning effects, and some strong committed performances it doesn't miss by much. Now there have been three main criticisms hurled at ""Oblivion"". Some have complained about its thin plot. Others took off points for its lack of originality. And yet others have had problems with the lack of any meaningful character development. I certainly don't flippantly dismiss any of these gripes but I don't necessarily agree with them either. There's a lot going on in ""Oblivion"" and while it does borrow from several other sci-fi pictures, the same could be said for most science fiction. As for the lack of character development, that may be true but I found there to be a good and needed reason for it. Like I said the less you know the better so I'm not going to spoil anything by divulging any significant details. The film is set in 2077 during the aftermath of a war with an alien species known as the Scavengers. The Scavs (as they're affectionally called) destroyed our moon which sent Earth into a series of natural and environmental convulsions. A full invasion of Earth followed. The humans won the war but the planet was left ravaged and in disrepair. The surviving population now inhabit one of Saturn's moons called Titan. Now if a sci-fi movie wants to score points with me just give me a futuristic world that's not only visually impressive but that I can get lost in. That certainly happened here and even if"
173,PYC_Doc3_Oblivion,PYC_Doc3_Oblivion,PYC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Oblivion is familiar territory, both for Cruise and for the science fiction genre. It unquestionably remains devoted first and foremost to delivering stylish visuals and gorgeous imagery, yet unlike Tron: Legacy's emptiness, second-time feature director Joseph Kosinski laces the world he's built with ideas. Granted, we've seen these ideas elsewhere, but in an era so hellbent on catering an absence of actual philosophy in its biggest budget studio fare, I found myself grateful that Oblivion didn't merely find inspiration in plot points from better sci-fi stories, but also in their themes. While many moments will likely provide deja vu, I didn't find the film derivative in a negative sense, but in a literal sense: the word derive comes from the Latin derivare, to draw off, as if from a stream. Oblivion draws its samples from the best sources available in a film whose first frame is a memory, it uses its familiarity to us to its advantage. It's like making a sandwich the way your mom used to make them, achieving sense memory of past pleasures. For a film set in the future and chock to the brim with special effects, it's surprisingly old-fashioned. Jack (Tom Cruise) is the Wall-E of 2077. When invaders destroy our moon an impressively gorgeous effect, always immaculately framed in the background of nighttime sequences Earth is effectively ruined, thanks to tsunamis and earthquakes. Humanity successfully wins the war against the invaders, but Earth is no longer habitable. Luckily, we find a safe home away from home in Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Traveling to Titan takes energy, so we develop a means of converting our ocean water into energy. Some invaders remaining on Earth attempting to disrupt this process, so a huge space station called the Tet controls a hefty number of drones which patrol the Earth hunting down our opponents who mean us harm. Jack and his lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are stationed high above Earth to serve as repairmen for the drones. Yet since Jack experiences memories from sixty years ago, memories he couldn't possibly have, we know from the beginning that this idyllic simplistic life he leads contains secrets stashed below the surface. It's impossible to delve into the particulars of the story without spoiling what unfolds, but as the posters reveal, Morgan Freeman shows up, given the type of outstanding entrance shot that is destined to be at the top of his Lifetime Achievement Oscar montage one day. In his first film, Kosinski showed a gift for creating impressive pictures that aspire to be iconic here, he improves upon his initial efforts, using his images to flesh out the characters and tell the story in a way he didn't seem to fully comprehend last time at bat. The best shots are stored in the brain more effectively this time around: Freeman's entrance, a memory of the Empire State Building, a nude swim in a glass pool, a descent into a spooky old library, and a certain fight sequence that pits"
174,PYC_Doc4_Oblivion,PYC_Doc4_Oblivion,PYC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"""Oblivion"" is a competently made sci-fi action movie  something that can't be said about the majority of the genre. Though many of the prominent futurism themes can be linked back to earlier films, and a few loose ends might not be tied up with the sturdiest of knots, the structure and plot twists keep the intrigue high while the action paces itself nicely alongside the unfolding mystery. Tom Cruise makes a compelling hero and the setup is a savvy blend of dystopian invention and amnesia-induced identity loss. The list of films ""Oblivion"" borrows from is a long one, but the concepts are all executed cleverly and proficiently, resulting in an epic space opus that presents far more moments of awe than head-scratching queries. The year is 2077 and Earth has been left nearly uninhabitable after a brutal war against an invading alien species known as ""Scavengers."" While the remnants of humanity have been gathered aboard the Tet, an enormous pyramidal space station that will eventually carry the survivors to a new home on one of Saturn's moons, technician Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain on Earth to monitor and perform maintenance on giant hydro-rigs and the protective, heavily armed robot drones that guard them. When a spaceship crash-lands nearby and Jack investigates, he rescues from the wreckage Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a mysterious woman whose appearance sets into motion the discovery of a massive conspiracy that will place the very fate of mankind in Jack's hands. ""Oblivion"" is heady, weighty, and cerebral science-fiction, foregoing the little green man angle for a much more sinister and complex alien incursion. In terms of postapocalyptic, futuristic thrillers, borrowing randomly from ""The Road Warrior,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Moon,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Total Recall,"" it's a highly ambitious and largely successful twist, toying with existential and deterministic viewpoints while smartly avoiding depressing bouts of violence or sacrifice. Its focus on altering or interfering with memories is augmented perfectly by the heavily synthesized soundtrack, itself lending to the dreamlike qualities of Jack's remembrances. An engaging mystery, ""Oblivion"" forces viewers to wait nearly two hours before giving up any secrets; but to the film's credit, the protracted anticipation is delightful. Mind-boggling and artistically visionary, the many answers it finally grapples with will probably raise further investigations into the various aspects less examined, but the climactic conclusion is pleasantly resolute  even if specific details can be rationalized with the term ""gaping plot holes."" An exemplary fit for IMAX screens, ""Oblivion"" boasts outstanding visuals that add tremendously to the scope of the project. Immense exterior shots and sets introduce the audience to a uniquely fascinating world, with unfriendly terrain, monumental wreckage, and obscured paradises. The interior designs are just as spectacular, though used much more sparingly. The obvious budget for special effects definitely helps establish and stabilize the pioneering perspective; visual wizardry occasionally substitutes for inchoate plot points. But perhaps most impressive of all is the origins of the story, starting as"
175,PYC_Doc5_Oblivion,PYC_Doc5_Oblivion,PYC,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"""Earth is a memory worth fighting for."" ""Oblivion"" centers on a drone technician, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise, ""Mission Impossible III: Ghost Protocol), who flies a Bubble Ship (a hybrid of a fighter spaceship and helicopter) and is tasked to fix downed drones on earth in 2077. He lives in a sleek dig high above the clouds together with his partner, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who also serves as his communication officer. She monitors his safety from their base in space and dutifully reports to their superior, Sally (Melissa Leo) through a sophisticated system. Before embarking on their five-year service, Jack and Victoria had their memories wiped to maintain the security of their mission. 60 years ago, earth was invaded by aliens, called 'scavs' (scavengers). The scavs shattered the moon, and without the moon, the earth destablized, resulting in earthquakes and tsunamis that destroyed half of the planet. Humans launched nukes to stave off the scavs and eventually won the war. However, the earth became mostly inhabitable and the surviving humans moved to Titan, one of the moons of the Saturn ring. The drones are used to man fusion reactors that drain seawater and convert into energy. They also patrol the earth's surface to shoot down any remaining scavs. Jack and Victoria are nearing the end of their mission; in two weeks, they will conclude their service and join the rest of the humans in Titan. While Victoria is looking forward to it, Jack has doubts and oddly feels that earth would always be his home. He's traveled far and wide and found unspoiled swaths on earth, including a remote cabin by the lake, a calming oasis. His uncertainty is confounded by recurring dreams of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and flashes of life in New York, which strangely feels like a memory of a past than a fantasy. When a spaceship crash lands on earth, Jack finds that it's filled with several pods of humans in hyper-sleep state. And inside one of the pods, is the woman in his dreams, who later wakes up and mentions that her name is Julia. Jack and Julia are discovered and captured by a group of rebels (led by Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), human survivors. The events that transpire, followed with fierce flying and firefights, make Jack realize that his life is not what it seems to be and that he's not what he thinks he is. He may just unknowingly holds the fate of mankind on his hands. Director Joseph Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") executes his vision with excellence. Cruise plays his part with sincerity, connects with both of his leading ladies and the higher mission he's entrusted with. With a straightforward story and humanity, ""Oblivion"" is captivating from the start. Part of the appeal is the mystery, which unfurls easily piece by piece and takes us along through each discovery and ultimate truth. A bigger appeal is the phenomenal visual, reminiscent of last year's ""Prometheus,"" elevated by an electronica beat, along the same vein"

But when that whatever arrives (and even before it does) the movie works as an experience that glorifies the megaplex ideal. I watched it in a very good IMAX theater in suburban Philadelphia that, like all IMAX theaters, had a guardrail sitting at the bottom of the screen. It seemed to be there expressly to prevent you from entering one of Tom Cruise's pores. Fully overwhelmed in IMAX might be the only way to watch this movie. It's been shot with a crispness that elevates the heart rate. Projected at that scale, you want to leave your seat and explore this postnuclear Earth, to walk the film's sands and marvel at the manner in which the geological table has been so fantastically upended that Manhattan erodes beneath dunes and decays at the base of canyons. (The year is 2073.) Oblivion oscillates between sites that are way up high and locations that are way down low, between the astral dark of outer space and the flashlit dankness of long-abandoned caves. Even at IMAX scale it remains thrillingly impossible to detect whether the orb-like drones that accompany Jack Harper, the wistful repairman Cruise plays, have true tactility or whether they're just projections from a hard drive. The drones perform surveillance, they're armed to the teeth, and their resemblance to eyeballs is a clever formal manifestation of their function, which is to hunt and exterminate aliens for an ominous entity called the Tet, whose twangy operations commander, Sally, is played by a scratchy video uplink of Melissa Leo. The orbs have a rapport with Jack that gives you that Blade Runner replicant feeling about him. They break; he fixes them. When Jack and, by extension, the orbs happen upon a tiny survivalist civilization of human rebels  they're the ""aliens,"" and they're called Scavs  the orbs descend and instigate a fantastic firefight. Tremendous care has gone into making you believe that the orbs are whizzing around, flying into beams, and machine-gunning everyone. No matter its actual provenance, this ruined and depopulated Earth often feels breathtakingly real. But there's too much time to realize that what Oblivion cares about most is how good it looks. The director and cowriter Joseph Kosinski is a trained architect and visual-effects designer who wrote the graphic novel that became this movie. His expertise is in vastness and scale. He knows how to fill the camera frame and can orchestrate chaos and elaborate movement so that your ability to follow it is simple and your nervous system's response to its intensity is involuntary. His meticulousness is as painstaking as it was in Tron: Legacy, another grand optical illusion that kept confusing commercial vanity with philosophical wonder. There he made light something you want to lick and wear and put inside you. Oblivion is something you want to be inside of. Upon entry, you'd have plenty of room to"

""We won the war but lost the planet,"" says Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a kind of grease-monkey pilot whose job is to repair the drones that monitor desolate Earth while the rest of humanity lives in a remote space station. His coworker and assigned girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) directs Jack's flying sorties over the wreckage of Manhattan, which may literally be a no-man's land. Yet as he lies in bed with Victoria, Jack has visions of another, mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko), from his fantasies or his past. ""I know you, but we've never met. I'm with you and I don't know your name. I know I'm dreaming, but it feels like more that. It feels like a memory. How can that be?"" And how is it that science-fiction films imagine the worst for our future while steeped in love-loss for our past? Perhaps because the genre blossomed, as literature and then cinema, in the late 1940s  the time of the Cold War and the first nuclear age  when our world's two great powers played a deadly game of mutually assured destruction, and when fearing the prospect of human extinction was not paranoia, just common sense. It's no wonder that any time before the Bomb seemed Edenic to sci-fi writers, readers and movigoers; any time after might spell The End. The same warm ache of nostalgia envelops the Jack of 2077, the hero of Joseph Kosinski's oh-so-serious Oblivion, for the pre-invasion Earth of 2017. He stands at the top of the Empire State Building, most of it covered in sand and rubble, wanders through the caverns of the New York Public Library on 42nd Street (only eight blocks away from King Kong's final perch but miraculously not buried) and patrols Yankee Stadium, scene of the very last World Series. He saves old books, a catcher's mitt and baseball and some LPs from the 1960s and '70s; Procol Harum keeps playing on his internal iTunes. Fixating on the 1948 Andrew Wyeth painting Christina's World, and on his dream girl, Jack finds a verdant interior life in this wasteland by mixing memory and desire. His poetic guide, though, is not Eliot but Macaulay, whose famous couplet in The Lays of Ancient Rome  ""And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, / For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods...""  haunts Jack like a long-ago pop tune or a distant battle cry. Oblivion must be the only science-fiction film that borrows substantially from I Am Legend, WALL-E and Sleepless in Seattle  itself a remake of 1957's An Affair to Remember, which was a remake of 1939's Love Affair. In fact, everything in this movie keeps looking backward. Victoria warns Jack that ""Our job is to not remember. Remember?"" That's the cue for this company man with a rebellious streak to find his future in the past,"

Oblivion is like that movie-within-a-movie: Everything in it feels 100 percent inauthentic. That vibe, as it happens, turns out to be intentional. But when the humans arrive, it's still a narcotic. The pity is that the film is about the war to liberate the human spirit from alien soul-snuffing exploiters and that Cruise is supposed to be our last best hope. In the long opening voice-over, his character, Jack (not Reacher), explains that ""Scavengers"" obliterated humankind: They blew up the moon and Nature did the rest. Humans beat the invaders back and then took off en masse to colonize a moon of Saturn, Titan. But a few people stayed behind to harvest the remaining resources and watch out for leftover ""Scavs."" Jack is teamed with a Brit named Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who sits in a giant mushroomlike flight tower reading data from ""hydro rigs"" and lethal drones. He flies around doing repairs and calling in those drones whenever there are signs of saboteurs. He also tells us that his memory has been wiped so that he won't spill any beans if grabbed by Scavs. Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) thinks big  big white impersonal settings on a big barren landscape under a big fractured moon with one big segment broken off and simply hanging, suspended in orbit, with a trail of little pieces floating around. But the sets just sit there. The first half-hour is Jack talking to Victoria on his headset, Jack fixing rigs, and Jack having sex with the eager-beaver Victoria. (Wow, does she want him.) They talk longingly of their imminent departure for Titan. Victoria speaks to an administrator on a screen called Sally (Melissa Leo). These scenes exert a strange fascination: They're so conscientiously neutral, so droningly dull that they almost pass for Stanley Kubricklike. But Jack shares our boredom. He feels dislocated. He has visions of himself atop the Empire State Building with another woman  someone more compelling than his vaguely robotic partner. Someone played by Olga Kurylenko, this year's comely avatar of spirituality. When Jack finds a crashed spaceship with human passengers (including Olga) in suspended animation and a drone flies in and starts blasting them, he's flummoxed. Drones are supposed to kill Scavs, not humans! And certainly not Olga! Eventually, Jack is captured by beings who look like humans (but you never know), led by Morgan Freeman, who puffs happily on a cigar  and you would, too, if you had to do as little for a paycheck this size. He says he was intrigued when Jack found a book with a poem by Macaulay in which three Romans sacrifice themselves to save their city. That's when things get murky.

Nowadays, the end times are only the beginning: an apocalyptic backdrop is something we're going to be seeing a lot of this year, so we might as well get used to it. In the glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered ""Oblivion,"" Tom Cruise is the last guy on Earth. He's Jack, a technician  a mechanic, really  whose job is to fix broken down drones (in a cute touch he sticks the first one back together with chewing gum). In other words, he's a bit like WALL-E, and Andrea Riseborough is his latter day Eve. They live in a billion-dollar birdhouse perched up above the clouds, and in a quaintly chauvinist set up, he reconnoiters the skies in a flashy starfighter prototype, while she sits at an interstellar telephone exchange and relays the commands of mission controller Sally (an irritatingly twangy Melissa Leo) from on high. See, the remainder of the human race has taken refuge on a giant spaceship (it looks like a floating audio speaker, something that wouldn't be out of place on the cover of an '80s progressive rock album). The plan is to scoot over to Saturn just as soon as they have sucked up enough hydropower from the Earth's oceans to fuel the journey. But why? Well, because of the alien invaders who destroyed the moon and threw the biosphere out of whack, that's why. As Cruise mournfully intones in the movie's lugubrious prologue, we won the war, but lost the planet. That's what the drones are for: to kill off the last remaining hostiles, or ""scavs,"" who have taken refuge on the edge of the radioactive wastelands that cover most of the globe. That's more than enough backstory, I know, but there's much more to come out, even as Jack goes about his daily routine, tracking down lost drones, revisiting ruined New York landmarks (the top of the Empire State Building now sits at ground level on a sea of dust), and occasionally going AWOL himself to grapple with fragmentary memories of a beautiful girl (Olga Kurylenko), and a lost world he has no right to remember. The story is officially credited to an unpublished comic book by the film's director, Joseph Kosinski. But if you poured all the most memorable sci-fi films from the past half century into a blender, from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the original ""Planet of the Apes"" all the way down to last year's ""Prometheus,"" you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic  though quite possibly more exciting.

180,PYC_Doc10_Oblivion,PYC_Doc10_Oblivion,PYC,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"In the opening sequence of Oblivion, the voice of Tom Cruise (playing the film's protagonist, Commander Jack Harper) creeps onto the soundtrack and painstakingly explains the precise details of the film's backstory. The year is 2077. The Earth is all but abandoned. An alien population known as Scavengers (Scavs for short) invaded the moon, which in turn nearly destroyed the earth. Most humans have moved to a space station. Drones and technicians like Harper roam the earth, and so on and son on. A metric ton of exposition is slammed into that opening sequence, but here's what's peculiar: at the beginning of the second act, after Jack discovers a hibernating astronaut (Olga Kurylekno) and saves her, he sits her down and gives her the whole spiel again. Why? Is this a safeguard in case people showed up late? Do they think we didn't get it the first time? I have a theory. As Cruise was explaining the whole movie again, my mind started to wander. (It had nothing better to do.) I found myself re-imagining the film, up to that point, without the Tom Cruise Explains It All voice-over  merely images of a ravished earth, followed by the jargon-heavy first act, establishing his work and daily routine. And guess what: in that one tiny alteration, the movie I made in my head was far superior to the one I was watching. Had we not been provided with that painfully labored exposition, had we been trusted to figure that info out for ourselves, or let it reveal itself organically (like when, say, he had to explain it to the astronaut), Oblivion could have been... well, it still wouldn't have been a great movie. But it would have been a far more interesting one. And I found myself wondering if co-writer/director Joseph Kosinski had put that voice-over in originally, or if it was the result of prodding by the suits, a la Blade Runner. But that's the trouble with mainstream science fiction filmmaking these days: there's no expectation that an audience is capable of putting things together or waiting for a payoff, and there certainly aren't many filmmakers or executives willing to take the risk. The problem, it seems, is the desire of those who greenlight movies to lump science fiction in with action, and it's easy to guess why: Star Wars. Before 1977, there were occasional crossovers, but for the most part, science fiction was a genre purely unto itself, concerned with alien invasions and post-apocalyptic scenarios and subtextual parallels. After Lucas mashed up spaceships and swashbucklers, sci-fi was never the same. This is not to say that there haven't been great sci-fi/action movies: the original Star Wars trilogy, of course, and the first two Terminators, and Aliens, and the first Matrix. But those films worked, to some extent, in spite of themselves  because the fundamental purposes of great science fiction and great action are so diametrically opposed. Great science fiction is brainy and smart, fueled by Big Concepts"
181,QJK_Doc1_Inception,QJK_Doc1_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Inception,"Christopher Nolan spent the first decade of the 21st century brandishing his credentials as an adapter. He'd gotten his foot in the door with the wholly original, wholly excellent ""Memento"" (2000), but the majority of his 2000s output is derived from pre-existing material, whether it be the well-received remake of ""Insomnia"" (2002) or his transformative reboot of the Batman franchise with ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). The latter of these two superhero films was such a massive critical and commercial success that Nolan was given a blank check to make whatever he wanted next. His choice? An original story he'd been kicking around since 2001 and had been retooling to suit his growing technical expertise: ""Inception"" (2010). ""Inception"" is, in my estimation, a watershed moment for Nolan. It was the release that elevated him from ""Dark Knight"" director to bona fide visionary and established him as a brand akin to the auteurs he grew idolizing (Steven Spielberg, the man who handed him the 2024 Best Director Oscar for ""Oppenheimer,"" is the most obvious example). The concept of blurring the lines between reality and dreams captivated audiences, and ""Inception"" quickly burrowed its way into the pop culture conversation (where it has stayed, thanks to memes and jokes involving spinning tops). But these aspects would not carry as much weight were it not for the fact that the film remains an absolute triumph a decade and a half later. Let's start with the premise. ""Inception"" is a classic example of Nolan's preferred storytelling method, which is to say, characterization through exposition. We learn who his characters are and what makes them tick by listening to them explain their specific profession. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are ""extractors"" who perform espionage by putting their targets to sleep and teasing out vital information through the target's subconscious. A businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants the duo to incept an idea in the mind of a competitor. This is widely believed to be impossible in the extraction business, but Cobb is desperate to return to his children in the United States and agrees to attempt. If that all sounds like a lot, don't worry. Cobb and Arthur spend the bulk of the film's runtime explaining the rules of the game and the deadly risks they're taking at every turn. It's generally considered a no-no to rely on exposition to the extent that Nolan does throughout ""Inception,"" especially in what is ostensibly a spy thriller, but the world he builds is so rich that it works. It's fascinating to peel back the mechanics of extraction and learn alongside newcomer Ariadne (Elliot Page). The scene in which Cobb tutors Ariadne on maneuvering dreams is an especially crucial showcase, establishing the mind-bending visuals of the dream world and the occasionally tricky ways Nolan uses film language to his advantage. A scene in which the two characters are at a university transitions to them chatting outside of a cafe, only to have Cobb pull"
182,QJK_Doc2_Inception,QJK_Doc2_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Inception,"I remember like today the summer that Christopher Nolan's Inception was first released . Nolan fans were expecting a challenging science-fiction exercise, and in the end they got what they wanted. Before filming it, Nolan spent ten long years digging through his brain library to write the script, postponing it on several occasions because he felt he wasn't ready for a project of this magnitude. But thankfully that's all history now. With this film, Nolan's ingenuity redesigns the codes of the science-fiction blockbuster, entering into generic territory with an intelligible staging, designed to make any viewer who doesn't have a brain on vacation think, for dreamers who think that cinema is the closest thing to daydreaming. This model of originality had not been conceived in science-fiction cinema since the Wachowski brothers shook the world with the release of The Matrix (1999). The prologue presents a metaphysical labyrinth of what we know as reality. Its world is set in a future where there is a technology that allows access to people's dreams to modify the thoughts within the subconscious and insert a new idea. This is how Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) explains the concept. He is an expert in extraction, that is, the man who appropriates the secrets of the subconscious just at the moment when the victim's mind is most vulnerable: during sleep. To put it bluntly, he is a thief who steals dreams and thoughts. Cobb finds himself trapped by his past, as he has become a highly coveted man in the world of corporate espionage, but also one condemned to be a fugitive hunted by agents from all over the world, costing him the separation from his two children. Despite all this, Cobb is presented with a chance for redemption when Saito (Ken Watanabe), the head of a major corporation, proposes that he assemble a team of mind thieves to orchestrate an ""inception""which consists of implanting an idea in the subconscious rather than removing itinto the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the head of a major rival corporation. Cobb's only motivation is to reunite with his two sons, because his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), died testing Cobb's dream device, whose origin is unknown but we do know that it is used for military purposes; that is why the plot mostly serves as exposition rather than developing the supporting characters more than they are. Their actions are balanced because they inhabit Cobb's point of view and function to mobilize the narrative exposition of the character's journey, the overlap between reality and dream is the essence of his world. The puzzle of the plot always keeps us thinking about the riddles that Cobb and his henchmen carry out within the fiction (metanarrative) in which they find themselves, which uses inverted montage, that is, the organization of the scenes is based on the chronological order of a classic three-act structure, but then becomes minimalist due to the parallelisms in which the action takes place. In this way, Nolan challenges the"
183,QJK_Doc3_Inception,QJK_Doc3_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Inception,"""I hate my dreams. They're so ... infantile."" Heaven knows what artist Laurie Anderson would make of Christopher Nolan's first film since ""The Dark Knight,"" but if audiences don't go for it, we're more likely to hear a different complaint: It's just too darned complex. A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolan's own original screenplay, ""Inception"" is the smartest CGI head-trip since ""The Matrix."" The premise is so out-there, it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain, so do yourself a favor and pay attention. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb, an ""excavator,"" who digs around in people's subconscious while they're catching some zzzzs. This act of infiltration is ""not strictly legal""; the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft. It's also not a solo operation. To do the job properly requires an ""architect,"" basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape, something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamer's defenses down. Depending on the complexity of the project, it might also require a ""burglar,"" a ""chemist"" and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well-timed wake up call. Cobb's partners include Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a newbie, Ariadne (Ellen Page); Yusuf (Dileep Rao); and Eames (Tom Hardy). Their client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants more than access to a rival industrialist's grey matter; he requires Cobb to plant an idea in there that will dismantle an entire conglomerate. As if that weren't hard enough, Cobb is also plagued with keeping his own demons at bay, in the form of an angry dead wife (Marion Cotillard). DiCaprio evidently hasn't got ""Shutter Island"" out of his system yet. A kind of meta-heist movie, ""Inception"" evokes Philip K. Dick's cerebral sci-fi, the exploration of alternate states of consciousness, memory and fantasy. But these are also Nolan's themes, familiar from the amnesiac noir of ""Memento"" and the many, varied mind-games practiced by the warring magicians in ""The Prestige"" as well as the psychological warfare between Batman and his adversaries (fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here). ""An idea is like a virus,"" says Cobb, and that idea too might have been born in Gotham City or in the rabid enthusiasm that greeted ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige,"" ""Inception"" is constructed as a box of tricks. Ariadne (who helped Theseus slay the minotaur in Greek mythology) devises labyrinths that are also escape hatches, and that metaphor of the maze runs through ""Inception,"" which is itself a puzzle to be navigated by filmmaker and audience alike. In the course of probing his subject's subconscious, Cobb escorts him into a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. If it's a little disappointing that each level plays out as a straight-up action thriller (this guy really should get out more), the rules of this game are delightfully devious. He has a tendency to over-complicate, but nobody bends time more ingeniously than Nolan. Three minutes in one dream might correspond to an hour in the next, and both transpire in"
184,QJK_Doc4_Inception,QJK_Doc4_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Inception,"What with The Matrix, Avatar and now this, lying twitching in your sleep with electrodes stuck to your head could be the new rock'n'roll. Christopher Nolan's new movie is a colossal digital artefact, a virtual reality sci-fi thriller set inside the dreaming mind, with brilliant architectural effects and a weirdly inert narrative inspired by Philip K Dick and Lewis Carroll. At some stage in the distant future, the technology of industrial espionage will allow snoopers to invade the dreams of CEOs and pinch commercially sensitive information. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb, a specialist who both carries out these hi-tech brain raids and trains executives to resist them. He operates with a crew of occult brain specialists who operate as if they are planning a heist or a con, drugging top business honchos, installing vast, detailed imaginary worlds inside their minds where they go into a lucid dreaming state, letting their subconscious guard down, in which condition his team will appear in various role-play guises and trick them into revealing, as it were, the recipe for Diet Coke. Japanese plutocrat Saito (Ken Watanabe) offers Cobb the challenge of a lifetime: not to steal an idea, but to plant one. He needs Cobb to insinuate himself into the dreams of a dangerous young business rival: Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy) and somehow instil in him a determination to break up the family empire that is hurting Saito's profits. Cobb assembles an elite squad of cerebro-hackers including Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). They plan to drug Fischer on a 10-hour plane flight and create a triple-decker dream, a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream  which, Narnia-like, will last 10 years in Fischer's dreaming mind. At the end of this, he will have arrived at a settled determination to break up his family firm. And he doesn't simply go to the deepest level first and then attain reality up through two successive waking episodes: he goes down, and down, and down. He, and we, could get something like decompression sickness: the bends. And there's another problem; Cobb is plagued with guilty visions of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), invading this synapseworld and threatening to become more real than either Cobb's trickster dreams or his waking life. There are some dizzying flourishes of FX magic in this movie. Cobb and Ariadne go for a stroll in the streets of Paris, which Nolan folds and tweaks and twists, with the avenues rising and falling like a pop-up book. They encounter a street that rises in front of them like a sheer rockface and, bracing a foot against it first, like Fred Astaire dancing around the walls in Royal Wedding, they proceed to walk straight upwards. Later, Arthur will fight with goons in a virtual hotel that suddenly swivels around: they plunge down a corridor that has become vertical, like a lift shaft, and later they will float around like spacemen or lost, drowning souls in a stateroom on the Titanic. The best moment comes before"
185,QJK_Doc5_Inception,QJK_Doc5_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Positive,Inception,"Leonardo DiCaprio and friends are ninjas of the subconscious, dashing through the landscape of other people's dreams, in Christopher Nolan's Inception. This endlessly fascinating swirl of a film could have come only from Nolan, who blends the cerebral twistiness of Memento (his thriller that moves backward in time) with the spectacular action of his Batman megahit, The Dark Knight. DiCaprio, as a thief-for-hire named Cobb, doesn't merely skulk around sleeping minds, pilfering strangers' secret thoughts. He and his team, complete with architect, actually construct the dream worlds they'll enter, with streets that can rise up and become wallsthe city as Murphy bedor, if things go wrong, a train roaring through city traffic. You may get a headache keeping up with the plot as Cobb tries to plant a new idea in a man's brain; stealing thoughts is simple, but adding one is a risky operation involving a dream within a dream within a dream. Even as you tick off the film's overload of references, thougha Matrix here, a James Bond therethe amazing effects and Cobb's quest carry you along. But Nolan is the brainiest of Hollywood directors, and Inception is more than the ultimate ""it was all a dream"" movie. It is the most sophisticated in a year of splashy screen events about parallel worlds, in which characters enter alternate realities and return with some solution to personal and often global problems. Cobb's dangerous assignment is meant to save the world from an energy conglomerate. Avatar's hero goes to Pandora, falls for its nature-loving people, and learns to value the environment. The characters on Lost travel sideways to other times and places in what seems an attempt to escape the island, but turns out to be a way to save their own souls. Even Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland transforms Lewis Carroll's story into a journey of self-discovery fit for the 21st century. The movie's Alice is a 19-year-old who returns from Wonderland realizing she doesn't have to marry the smug gentleman her family selected; she can head out to sea and open a trade route to China instead. These films, not radical-minded indies but among the most expensive and popular onscreen, suggest that reality is so fraught and problematic that we need to go elsewhereout of this world or deep into our mindsto see things clearly. They evoke a Wizard of Oz parallel dimension (""You're not in Kansas anymore, you're on Pandora,"" the villainous colonel in Avatar warns), but their lessons are more political than ""There's no place like home."" Cobb is hired by a businessman (Ken Watanabe) to plant a thought in the brain of a rival (Cillian Murphy). The new idea: the rival must break up the conglomerate he is about to inherit, which is poised to control half the world's energy and become, as one character puts it, ""a new superpower."" A too-powerful energy company? Nolan's astute and prescient observation seems like eyes-open common sense in these BP-weary days. As his plot mirrors world events, Nolan"
186,QJK_Doc6_Inception,QJK_Doc6_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Negative,Inception,"Christopher Nolan, the British-born director of ""Memento"" and of the two most recent Batman movies, appears to believe that if he can do certain things in cinemaespecially very complicated thingsthen he has to do them. But why? To what end? His new movie, ""Inception,"" is an astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly. Nolan has devoted his extraordinary talents not to some weighty, epic theme or terrific comic idea but to a science-fiction thriller that exploits dreams as a vehicle for doubling and redoubling action sequences. He has been contemplating the movie for ten years, and as movie technology changed he must have realized that he could do more and more complex things. He wound up overcooking the idea. Nolan gives us dreams within dreams (people dream that they're dreaming); he also stages action within different levels of dreamingdeep, deeper, and deepest, with matching physical movements played out at each levelall of it cut together with trombone-heavy music by Hans Zimmer, which pounds us into near-deafness, if not quite submission. Now and then, you may discover that the effort to keep up with the multilevel tumult kills your pleasure in the movie. ""Inception"" is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else. The outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper. Leonardo DiCaprio, with a full head of golden hair and a touch of goatee, plays Cobb, an international thief. Not a common thief, but an ""extractor"": he puts himself to sleep, enters the dreams of another person, then rummages around and steals something important that pops out of the sleeper's unconsciousan industrial secret, say. Saito (Ken Watanabe), the head of an enormous Japanese energy company, hires Cobb to go beyond extraction to inception; that is, not to steal an idea but to plant one that the dreamer will think is his own. Just like Danny Ocean preparing to crack a safe, Cobb assembles a larcenous crew, who will enter the mark's dreams with him. There's a dream architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), who can create convincing interior worlds, so that the dreamer will think that everything is real. There's a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), who, in the dreams, can embody any person known to the dreamer. There's a chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), to drop both the team and the target into deeper layers of sleep with a super-sedative. And there's a kind of dream manager, a demanding, unimaginative sourpuss named Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to insure that the fantastic sting comes off. There's also a wild card. Cobb's dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), keeps jumping out of the lower reaches of his mind bearing a knife or a gun and crashing into the created dreams. Cobb is still in love with her, and feels guilty about something he did to her. Occasionally, he takes a rusty old elevator down to his subconscious and visits her. Cotillard, with her amber coloring, is ravishing and tear-stained, and, if you"
187,QJK_Doc7_Inception,QJK_Doc7_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Negative,Inception,"Director Christopher Nolan is such a master movie technician -- a combination of engineer, architect, game designer and God -- that it's startling to realize how constricted his vision is and how clumsily he tells stories. ""Inception,"" Nolan's first film since his mega-googolplex hit with ""The Dark Knight,"" and his first as a solo writer-director since the now-legendary puzzler ""Memento"" in 2000, is supposed to be a dreamscape movie. At one point, in fact, we travel with its central Scooby-gang of characters into a dream within a dream within a dream, and then into some deeper, still more unconscious, psychological limbo-state below that. Managing all these nested levels of narrative is a marvelously nerdy accomplishment, no doubt -- but this is the most tight-assed vision of the innermost human psyche I've ever seen. While Nolan's images are visually impressive and powered by state-of-the-art digital effects and accomplished stunt work, they're always ordered and organized with anal precision. They don't look or feel anything like dreams. (Or, at least, not like my dreams.) They look instead like mediocre action films from the '90s, or in the case of the supremely boring ski-patrol vs. Arctic fortress shootout found on Level Three, like the Alistair MacLean adaptation ""Ice Station Zebra"" from 1968. (With Rock Hudson! And Ernest Borgnine!) ""Inception"" may have been directed by Christopher Nolan, but Nolan's dreams are apparently directed by Michael Bay. OK, I know -- you want me to back off the high-minded analysis and tell you whether ""Inception"" is a good destination for those summer moviegoing dollars eager to leap out of your wallet. Sure, I guess so. It's a cool-looking action movie, carefully constructed and edited, that uses all kinds of nifty locations and a lot of portentous-sounding expositional yammering. It inhabits a Philip K. Dick-style universe of psychological warfare that suggests ""The Matrix,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" -- all of them, by the way, better movies -- but it's fairer to call ""Inception"" a maze movie or a labyrinth movie than a puzzle movie. Because, as the wisecracking fellow critic sitting next to me observed, every time the story gets puzzling the characters call a timeout and explain it. So, yeah, if you approach ""Inception"" with lowered expectations it's a pretty good time. Problem is, there are no lowered expectations around Christopher Nolan, whose adherents have proclaimed him as the heir to Kubrick and Hitchcock and declared ""Inception"" a masterpiece. I don't want to get sidetracked here, but let me suggest that the comparisons aren't entirely misguided. They're just not helpful. Nolan has inherited some of Kubrick and Hitchcock's worst tendencies, most notably their defensive, compulsive inclination to work everything out about their stories and characters to the last detail, as if human beings and the world were algebraic or geometrical phenomena requiring a solution. But the mysterious power of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" cannot be explained by the ludicrous official story revealed in the final act -- indeed, it nearly scotches the whole movie -- and"
188,QJK_Doc8_Inception,QJK_Doc8_Inception,QJK,Sci-Fi,Negative,Inception,"Inception is an ambitious, initially absorbing film that mutates into something unpleasantly unwieldy. hristopher Nolan's Inception is Instruction Manual Cinema, a film that spends so much time explainingand explaining, and explainingthe rules of its narrative conceit that it fails to either emotionally engage or, except in a few notable spots, viscerally thrill. Working from a canvas at once larger than The Dark Knight and yet markedly reminiscent of it (not to mention countless other celluloid sagas), Nolan's would-be epic is a work of sometimes stunning imagery but only affected heart, a pseudo-heist film that borrows liberally from all corners of the cinematic world (The Matrix, eXistenZ, Last Year at Marienbad, the canons of David Lynch and Michael Mann) in service of a tale that's as hollow as its reality-bending Rubik's Cube ruses are intricate. Focusing on a secret agent man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who enters people's dreams to steal vital pieces of well-kept information, Nolan's sci-fi latest is enraptured by the sense of falling down the rabbit hole, not simply via its dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams centerpieces, but through the sheer wealth of information it vomits up at every turn. Head-spinning exposition takes the place of wonder throughout, leaving only the transient rush of particularly vivid visuals and a faint whiff of a better film that could have been. Nolan wastes no time with setup, immediately thrusting viewers into a perplexing scene in which Cobb washes up on a sunny shore, sees a vision of two young children playing in a grassy yard, and then visits an elderly Japanese man whom he seems to know. This encounter takes place in a gorgeously decorated chamber with wall panels and hanging lamps, but lingering to admire the sights isn't Inception's strong suit, and soon the film is off into other apparent realities, with chitchat filling in the gaps at breakneck speed. Turns out, Cobb is trying to pilfer valuable knowledge from corporate bigwig Saito (Ken Watanabe) as a test to see if he's up for a larger taskone that involves not taking info from someone's mind (a process called ""extraction""), but rather, inserting a new idea (dubbed ""inception"") in the noggin of energy magnate Maurice Fischer's (Pete Postlethwaite) only heir, Robert (Cillian Murphy). For mysterious reasons related to his dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a penchant for showing up unannounced in dreams and thwarting Cobb's robberies, Cobb isn't instantly interested in this dangerous, difficult gig. Nonetheless, Saito's promise that performing the job will mean Cobb can finally return home to the U.S.where his kids are, and from which he's been exiled for enigmatic legal reasonsquickly seals the deal. From there, we're treated to a lengthy middle section in which Cobb assembles his team and concocts his ruse, a standard heist-film structure that quickly proves most notable for the myriad rules governing dream infiltration, and for the wholesale lack of importance of said regulations. Phony tech, philosophical, and psychological terminology abounds but it's all of little concern except as a means of generating"

Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. At the movies, incomprehensible gibberish has become a way of life, but it usually takes time before it's clear that a movie really stinks. Inception, Christopher Nolan's latest assault on rational coherence, wastes no time. It cuts straight to the chase that leads to the junkpile without passing go, although before it drags its sorry butt to a merciful finale, you'll be desperately in need of a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color, shading and shadows, and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea, reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who haven't got a clue about plot, character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento, the perilously inert Insomnia, the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige, the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical, maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolan's scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception, and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. It's difficult to believe he didn't also write, direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche, New York. But as usual, like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman, Mr. Nolan's reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players, none of whom have an inkling of what they're doing or what this movie is about in the first place, and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who remains one of the screen's most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese's dopey insane-asylum bomb, one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo, not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed. I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible. Let's see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave, I wanted to jump in, but the thrill didn't last.

Slap! Wake up, people! Shalalala! Slap! Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb (the name sounds like it should evoke somethingbut what? Dummkopf?), who specializes in plunging into people's ""subconscious"" minds while they sleep and extracting their corporate secrets. (I'm with Freud in preferring ""unconscious."") But his new client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants the impossible: for Cobb not to steal an idea but to plant one in a business rival's head. Why is an ""inception"" more difficult than an extraction? ""The subject's mind always knows the genesis of an idea,"" explains one characterwhich strikes my unoriginal and highly suggestible mind as dead wrong. But that's the premise, anyway. Cobb accepts the job because he longs to see his two little kids in the U.S. and is forbidden to return on account of a Crime to Be Revealed Later; and Saito says that with one phone call he can make the legal problems go away. (He just can.) Then Saito says what in this kind of thriller are magic words: ""Assemble your team."" A team of colorful specialists! Cool! So it's, like, Mission: Impossible in the Dreamscape-Matrix! Cobb's point man is Arthur, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also evokes The Matrix: He looks like Keanu Reeves's runty little brother. Eames (Tom Hardy) is the ""forger,"" who can impersonate people in dreams without those dumb M:I rubber masks. The chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), will create the badass sedatives that will hold the fragile three-dream edifice together. The brilliant architecture student Ariadne (Ellen Page) has two functions: dreamworld designer and exposition magnet. She's a newbie, so Cobb has to explain to her how the science works. It takes a lot of explaining. Nolan, who wrote the script, thinks like a mechanical engineer, and even when you can't follow what's happening, you can admire in theory the multiple, synchronized narrative arcs and cute little rules for jumping around among different flights of consciousness. He has two fresh ideas. In a dream, you can fall asleep and have another dream, in which you can fall asleep and have another dreamexcept time works differently at different depths. A minute up top might be, say, ten minutes in the dream, an hour in the dream within a dream, and, below that, years.

It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun.The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment. In a free society many, maybe most, audience members will hardly notice the message. But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous. You know who you are.The movie is set in the 21st centuryhey! that's our century!at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His.Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend.Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feelswell, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that the form of battle used in the movie is ""Gun-Kata,"" which is ""a martial art completely based around guns."" I credit Nunziata because I think he may have invented this term. The fighters"
192,RJE_Doc2_Equilibirum,RJE_Doc2_Equilibirum,RJE,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibirum,"Transcribed verbatim from the DVD commentary track of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, here's an informative sci-fi concept from director George Lucas: ""As we go through the movie, there's all little funny moments like Jango bumping his head, because in Star Wars one of the Stormtroopers bumps his head as they leave the control room on the Death Star and I thought, 'Wouldn't it be funny if that's a trait that Jango has is...he...when he puts his helmet on and everything he can't really see that well and so he's constantly bumping his head, and that trait gets cloned into all the Stormtroopers and that's why they keep bumping their heads.'"" Don't get me wrong: I love Star Wars more than most critics, but there comes a point in any branch of science fantasy when you have to punch the dweeboids in the solar plexus and make 'em think a little. On par with this year's satisfactorily diverting Minority Report and Solaris, we're now offered Equilibrium, a similarly adolescent but earnest sci-fi hybrid that's equal parts Star Wars (evil patriarch, storm troopers, lone hero), The Matrix (same bullet-time stunts, fetishized machine guns, techno-thrash jams, icy badass chic) and most obviously Fahrenheit 451 (the nearly successful torching of the human spirit). Honestly, Francois Truffaut's elegant 451 needs a cinematic update anyway, as only a pitiful percentage of post-post-modern people would give a flip if all the world's books were torched to ashes. To adapt Ray Bradbury's marvelous story nowadays, the fascistic firemen would have to burn DVDs, SUVs or PS2s, and that's just plain silly (imagine hippies wandering around at the denouement, claiming to be the last living receptacles of Resident Evil or a RAV4). While it starts off with a laughably heavy-handed tone (writer-director Kurt Wimmer cut his blunt teeth on the 1995 Brian Bosworth vehicle, One Tough Bastard), Equilibrium improves as it rolls along--either that or, ironically, it wears down the senses until the viewer succumbs. Whatever the case, we are introduced to a now-standardized post-apocalyptic world in which boho artist colonies are systematically destroyed--along with the boho artists--by troops of mean guys in black with high-'n'-tight haircuts. You see, these big-city ""clericks"" have the nerve to patrol the outer ""nethers"" and torch the very Mona Lisa in their attempt to rid the world of all creativity and feeling. Feeling is bad. Feeling causes war. Thus, feeling is outlawed under penalty of death. In the midst of this cheery scenario we meet Clerick John Preston (Christian Bale, amping his innate chill factor). A widower with kids, Preston takes his job of snuffing out all human emotion--or ""sense crime""--extremely seriously, right down to injecting into his neck his regular doses of Prozium (gee, where'd they get that term?) to flatline his emotions in keeping with the mandate of the Master Clerick (Angus MacFadyen in an easy role after playing Robert the Bruce in Braveheart and a wannabe Hitler in Snide and Prejudice). Obviously, as the narrative progresses,"
193,RJE_Doc3_Equilibirum,RJE_Doc3_Equilibirum,RJE,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibirum,"I bought Equilibrium just because Christian Bale is in it. To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. It takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality. The movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. The government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be ""sense offenders"" on the spot (""I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?""). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. For the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like. Many people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The"
194,RJE_Doc4_Equilibirum,RJE_Doc4_Equilibirum,RJE,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibirum,"Set in a future, post-World War III society where emotions have been outlawed, Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), a government agent who begins to have doubts about the policy he is enforcing. Equilibrium is the perfect example why I do not rate lower for derivativeness or unoriginality. The film is basically high-concept combination of Fahrenheit 451 (1966), George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (original published in 1949, film versions appeared in 1954, 1956 and 1984), The Matrix (1999) and a bit of The Wizard of Oz (1939) thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are (assuming it's not a case of plagiarism), as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning, but how well the material is handled. The high-concept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly. On its surface, after a brief action-oriented beginning, Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film (meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed) to a thriller to a ""gun fu""-styled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writer/director Kurt Wimmer (who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him, including Sphere (1998) and The Recruit (2003)), with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth. The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff, which almost ""out-Matrixes"" The Matrix in style, if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat. Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogue-heavy, and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this (one of two) primary theme(s). Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior, but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion, and emotions are so wrapped-up with being sentient beings, it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them, and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through. Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's self-medication epidemic--even the title of the film"

Then films like Equilibrium come out and remind us that it's not that we're out of ideas so much as we're just not trying hard enough. Not that Equilibrium is inherently new - it borrows a fair few plot concepts from Farenheit 451 and Nineteen Eighty-Four, to name the most prominent examples. It is the way in which the old ideas are combined with the new that makes Equilibrium a fun and underrated experience. The premise is simple enough. In a kneejerk reaction to the horrors of World War Three, the survivors outlaw what they blame the chaos upon. Their own emotions, in other words. As the lead character has a series of revelations, we begin to understand that in so doing, they have also outlawed much of what gives our existence a point. In the bland, lifeless world that the law-abiding citizens inhabit, everything that the audience takes for granted to make their lives worthwhile is being systematically destroyed. Shades of the America of today, the whole principle of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, are shown in a stark horror show. I've read people comparing this film to The Matrix or its sequels. Where The Matrix series' fights were overlong, and often with no payoff, Equilibrium's fights are short and to the point. The difference this makes is, needless to say, as uplifting as Preston's fight to regain the humanity he stripped so many others of. Instead of having fights with no emotional connection to the characters, the story is given sufficient development to make the audience care what happens. The film is not entirely without flaws. The Prozium element seems to have been written with no regard for the facts about psychiatric medicines. Their purpose is not to suppress emotion at all, but to balance the chemical system of the brain in order to give the patient better control of them. Sure, they're not without problems of their own, but exaggerating them like this does not do the portion of the community that needs them any favours. That aside, however, the on-camera struggle is one of the most intriguing I've viewed for some time. Ergo, this minor plot problem is made up for. The only other real complaint I have is that the film could have done with a little more footage to give some characters more of a chance to develop. I gave Equilibrium an eight out of ten. It's not the best negative science fiction you'll ever see, but it is enough of a breath of fresh air that this won't entirely matter. If the MPAA made more films like this, it wouldn't be suffering the constant financial dire straits that it so loves to blame everyone else for."
197,RJE_Doc7_Equilibirum,RJE_Doc7_Equilibirum,RJE,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibirum,"It looks good. Well, that's the positive aspect of this film out of the way. Quite simply, it's amazing that this film even got made, being nothing more than a sorry, derivative ragbag of pilfered ideas, with not a single one of its own to justify its existence. The nearest one can come to describing this Frankenstein monster of a travesty is ""1984"" crossed with ""The Matrix"", and the latter wasn't exactly blindingly original to begin with. As if this isn't bad enough, the film is loaded with inconsistencies and plot holes, all shoddily papered over in the name of convenience as well as scenes and dialogue so hackneyed you can see them coming a mile off (and if you can't, you should really see more films. Preferably good ones). I actually uttered one line seconds before the character did, and had to stifle risible laughter when Preston came face to face with the itty bitty, cutesy-wutesy puppy. (In this scene, please note that the budget  having probably been spent all on bullets  didn't seem to stretch to any sort of animal training, as it relies on actors pointing off-camera and saying, ""Stop it! It's getting away!"" and reaching down, most unconvincingly). Laughter, in fact, is the only realistic response to the majority of this farrago, if only to stave off the angry realisation that your time is being wasted. You want laughs? AND HERE BE SPOILERS (although it's kind of hard to spoil something that's already this rank, IMHO) In the lead up to the ""climactic"" fight, one character warns Preston that, should he get too close to""Father"" (highly original name for a ""Big Brother"" figure, eh? Lucky they didn't call him ""Uncle"" or ""Second Cousin Twice Removed"") he'll be shot down by snipers. When the spit hits the fan, however, there are no snipers, not a one: only an endless parade of policemen, doing what they do best throughout: dying. Honest, these guys, despite their fierce get-up, turn out to be the most useless, butter-fingered cannon-fodder since the Imperial Stormtroopers in the original ""Star Wars"" (and countless other Z-grade imitations). Once you realise that they couldn't hit a barn door at ten feet and that their tactics seem to consist of merely lining up to get gunned down, you're left with no tension, nothing at stake and only the tedious sight of moronic sitting ducks being blown away, noisily, time and time and time and time again. It doesn't help that, having walked Preston into a trap and taken his weapon, they don't think to search him for anything else, leaving him free to conceal guns and an abundance of spare ammo, as well as a complicated reloading mechanism...all up his sleeves. Good thing nobody shook his hand. This is the film's idea of a ""twist"": a development so implausible, so gobsmackingly unlikely that it's an insult to any intelligent film-goer.

198,RJE_Doc8_Equilibirum,RJE_Doc8_Equilibirum,RJE,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibirum,"A tedious rip-off sci-fi film, itching to be another Matrix (or, maybe just a bearable flick!), that brazenly steals everything from Orwell's 1984 novel and many other thinking man's films, with the same Dystopian agenda, such as Fahrenheit 451. It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I've seen this film's theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre! Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995-""One Man's Justice""), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998-""Sphere,"" the 1999-""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and the 2003-""The Recruit,"" never got this 'baby' off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state: ""Without love, breath is just a clock ticking""), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of cliches from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It's a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression). Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he's a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called ""Gun-Kata"") going on missions to root out all rebels who haven't taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he's also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge's expected fate is as doomed as Preston's wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner ""I spread my dreams under your feet."" Before you can say 'let's burn some more books' all of the following things happen to Preston: he's given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be"

The moviea mish-mash of Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" George Orwell's ""1984"" and several other 20th Century anti-authoritarian classicsis about a post-nuclear-war world where war and crime have been eradicated, emotion has been banished and all the things that might provoke it, such as great art, poetry, literature and music, have been outlawed as well. Trapped in this world is John Preston (Christian Bale), a ""cleric"" or supercop. His job is to track down art-hoarders and emotion-feelers and destroy their art works, just as it was Guy Montag's job in ""Fahrenheit 451"" to find hidden books and burn them up. Preston is the best there is, thought-policeman numero uno. And, as played by Bale, the fashion-conscious Wall Street maniac of ""American Psycho,"" he has the rapt body moves of a high-tech gun-toting samurai and the lean, high cheekboned, toned and trimmed look of a killer/supermodel. Bale is fairly credible even though he's shown doing preposterous things like burning up the Mona Lisa or shooting his partner Partridge (Sean Bean) through a copy of Yeats' poems. With his dead dark eyes, Bale can make stillness either menacing or poignant. As with most movie heroes of this type, Preston has a soft spot, and you know that sooner or later, he'll turn, just as Montag went over to the book people in ""451.""""Equilibrium"" has an underground group of art-loving radicals who are deep within the bowels of the city, making bombs. Fairly soon, Preston has found them, fallen in love with captured and condemned dissident, Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and is being pursued himself by his smug, smiling ex-partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) and his snaky little boss DuPont (Angus MacFadyen), who has a few whopping surprises up his sleeve.Preston hardly has a character arc. He starts as a killer and continues as one, simply changing targets. But the movie tries to persuade us that his deeper sensibilities and sensitivity have been awakened by Maryand that, perhaps, the prozium-doped public may be aroused as well. Sure they will. ""Equilibrium"" has a sterile, steely surfaceit was shot mostly in modern-day Berlin in Nazi-era architectureand a trancelike rhythm to go with its derivative, punch-the-keyboard plot. The characters act like robots and the story unfolds like a computer program. It's such a slick, brutal, mechanically constructed film that the intensity of the theme and its anti-technology sentiments keep surprising you. If writer-director Kurt Wimmer loves art and feeling so much, why doesn't he show us more of it? Emily Watson and her yearning, erotic gaze supply most of the movies' softer emotions, while the good guys and bad guys alike keep blasting each other throughout. In ""Equilibrium,"" the rebels are just as destructive as the tyrants, and I'm not sure this is intended with ironyany more than the movie is consciously putting homoerotic undercurrents into the heated"

He/it has determined that man's inhumanity to man is fueled by his ability to feel. Hence everybody's on heavy doses of Prozium, which makes them think and behave in a neutral, obedient fashion. Subsidiary clericks like top-of-class John Preston (Christian Bale) are trained to intuit signs of sense offenses, thereby ferreting out persons who read books, look at paintings, listen to music, hide pre-Grammaton memorabilia, go off medication, or otherwise dare forbidden emotions. Offenders are invariably executed; one such was Preston's own wife, some years ago. The occasional nostril twitch suggests he perhaps wasn't as hunky-dory with that event as he claims, though grade-school-aged son Robbie (Matthew Harbour) appears to be developing just fine into a droning little fascist-snitch. It's unclear just how much of civilization is left, or even if there are other cities outside pic's Librya. There are pockets of illegal dissent beyond town limits, however, in a zone known as the Nethers. John & Co. are frequently dispatched there to break up radical cells and torch their verboten booty. In a sequence that sets the somber-silly tone, ""Equilibrium's"" first such raid uncovers  wouldn't ya know it  the original Mona Lisa! To which blowtorch is immediately applied. When his clerick-ing workmate commits suicide rather than be exposed as a Yeats-reading sense offender, John gets a new partner. Brandt (Taye Diggs) is a by-the-book squealer who immediately suspects Preston of harboring illicit ideas. Indeed, protag has stopped taking his Prozium, and is fishing about trying to join the resistance. Still keeping up the good front, he regretfully takes part in the bust of free-thinker Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson, utterly wasted in just a few scenes), who sees him for the sensitive soul he's secretly becoming. In this supposedly far-advanced society, plot holes are widened by the apparent nonexistence of bullet-proof vests or phone call tracing. Among numerous absurdities is Mary marching like Joan of Arc (or a volcano-sacrificed jungle virgin) to her sentenced doom, an event prompting Preston to declare, ""She's scheduled for combustion!"" Or a final digitized robo-t'ai chi-fu face-off between hero and chief nemesis (Angus MacFayden) that looks a whole lot like patty-cake. Much of the ultimately-inspirational nonsense is drenched in the ominous, then heavenly choirs of Klaus Bedelt's score, which doesn't get the joke, either. Reminiscent of ""Gattaca"" some years back, ""Equilibrium"" gets away acceptably with doing ""the future"" on a medium budget by focusing on utilitarian, bureaucratic and/or desolate landscapes, with gray the primary color. F/x and animation aspects are OK, though fight trickery that worked for ""Matrix"" and certain imitators doesn't work here.

She is also befriended by the clique of popular girls (dubbed ""the Plastics"" by Janis), queened by Regina (Rachel McAdams), who think Cady pretty enough to be their friend despite her ignorance of proper social rules for high-school ""success."" Janis and Damian think it's a scream that Cady is accepted into the inner circle of ""the Plastics,"" and tell her to pretend to be friends with them in order to spy on them, perhaps learning something which can be used against them. Cady, however, is genuinely nice to everyone, not having learned the nasty socialization of high school that she has been lacking in her education. She doesn't remain innocent for long. Cady is quickly swept into their world and begins to become one of them  dressing to their standards (i.e., like a slut), lying and back-stabbing, gossiping about and putting down the rest of the world. In the end, when this behavior has alienated her from absolutely everyone, even those from whom she learned this behavior, she decides that ""calling someone fat doesn't make you thinner, and calling someone dumb doesn't make you smarter."" Now there's some wisdom for you. Mean Girls, written by ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Tina Fey (who also plays math teacher Ms. Norbury), was loosely inspired by a non-fiction self-help book by Rosalind Wiseman called Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence. I don't know what lessons Wiseman's book imparts, but as far as I can tell here are the lessons of Mean Girls: High-school girls are basically back-stabbing, lying gossipers at heart. Everyone who is not a total loser is having sex in high school. Being mean to other people won't ultimately make you happy. And, of course, Homeschoolers are ordinarily loser freaks, unless they are really hot like Lindsay Lohan and become properly ""socialized."" In the end, no one has really learned their lesson (despite Regina's unfortunate accident with a school bus), though everyone can get along now  ever since ""the Plastics"" broke up and each joined other cliques. It's nice to see some respectable authority figures. Cady's parents are caring and smart (even if her father doesn't know what ""grounded"" means).

Not to mention all the other tricks of the teen-flick trade: The jokes about flatulence, vomiting naughty dogs, breast size, sexual identity and so on that pop up as if required by Hollywood law. Maybe I am wrong indulging in conspiracy theories about studio meddling Or perhaps Im simply expecting too much of Fey, who had the difficult task of pulling a comedy out of Rosalind Wisemans serious parental guidebook Queen Bees And Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip And Other Realities Of Adolescence. But Fey is better than this. As SNL s first female head writer and host of the popular ""Weekend Update"" segment, she has distinguished herself as one of the few bright lights on a show that long ago passed its sell-by date. She has a prickly satiric sense that is largely missing from Mean Girls.

204,SMA_Doc4_Mean_Girls,SMA_Doc4_Mean_Girls,SMA,Comedy,Negative,Mean_Girls,"With a screenplay by Tina Fey of ""Saturday Night Live,"" my hopes were high that ""Mean Girls"" would represent what Fey has been bringing to the show for some time now: a sharp, weird sense of humor. Trafficking unknowingly in stale teen girl flick cliches and failing to maintain a narrative flow past the hour mark, ""Mean Girls"" is a disappointment, and a poor directing job from clearly-out-of-his-league filmmaker, Mark Waters. There are laughs, but also a great deal of disinterest what the film is trying to say. After being home schooled in Africa for most of her life, Cady (Lindsay Lohan, ""Freaky Friday"") is making a fresh start in a suburban Illinois high school. Trying to fit into her treacherous surroundings, Cady makes friends with two ""art geeks"" (Daniel Franzese and Lizzy Caplan), as well as three of the most popular girls in the school, known as ""The Plastics"" (Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried). Torn between the friends she respects and the popularity that will bring her attention, boys, and pretty clothes, Cady is pushed to the brink when The Plastics begin to betray her. Employing the rules of the jungle to help achieve revenge, Cady attempts to keep her self-respect as she sorts out the mess she's in. What's really exciting about ""Mean Girls"" is that it was written by current ""Saturday Night Live"" savior Fey. In her first feature film screenplay, hopes were high that Fey could translate her razor wit and crack timing to the big screen, especially in the excruciatingly flooded genre of the high school clique comedy. ""Mean Girls"" is a nice idea for a film, based on the novel by Rosalind Wiseman. ""Girls"" opens as a satire of high school life, complete with broad student stereotypes and requisite weenie teachers (played by Fey and Tim Meadows). The defining material of the film is how Wiseman juxtaposes the backstabbing, ferocious high school relationships with similar ones found in the animal life of Africa, and director Mark Waters (""Freaky Friday"") covers this material exactly for the first 45 minutes. But much like Cady herself, Waters begins to fall a little too much in love with his movie, and he doesn't know when to stop. ""Mean Girls"" is only a genuinely smart, wonderful film for about a 1/3 of its running time. The rest is devoted to stale gags (the film contains another entry for the ""2004: Year of the Fart Joke"" awards) and material so depressingly familiar that it sucks all the energy out of the production by the time it reaches the hour mark, where it just simply shrivels up and dies. Most of the fault for the failure of ""Mean Girls"" can be placed on Waters's shoulders, as he is just the wrong man for this job. Fey's script is peppered with biting jabs at overindulging parents, sexualized pre-teens (a ripe topic if I ever saw one), and the awkwardness of being in high school without a defining identity.

205,SMA_Doc5_Mean_Girls,SMA_Doc5_Mean_Girls,SMA,Comedy,Negative,Mean_Girls,"Mean Girls boasts a screenplay written by the queen bee of hip comedy, Tina Fey, who used Rosalind Wiseman's parental self-help tome ""Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends & Other Realities of Adolescence"" as a reference point. Wiseman's book offers little that hasn't been covered by Jane Austen, Emily Bronte or Louisa May Alcott; mostly it describes age-old social situations in pop-psycholgical terms under the guise of candidness. All you need to know about Wiseman is that she has spent time on ""Dr. Phil"" promoting Empower, her organization that works to ""empower"" adolescent girls to proactively synergize their diverse energies into interpersonal win-win situations  a Coveyization of ""Girl World"" understanding. Ultimately, her method yields little actual insight because it's so reductive; she employs charts, graphs and tables to organize all girls into ""types"" (queen bee, sidekick, torn bystander, messenger and target), then interviews a bunch of them and plugs their comments into her analysis where handy. By simplifying humans into sub-archetypes, they become less like actual humans and more like stock movie characters. It would be a good starting point, perhaps, if the reader were unaware how treacherous adolescence can be. Fundamentally, though, it's an incomplete understanding of the complexity of human relationships that masquerades as deep analysis  Wiseman doesn't attempt to get under the skin of her subjects, like the better efforts of Rachel Simmons' ""Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls"" or Mary Pipher's ""Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls."" The reality is that most high school boys and girls are acutely aware of ""types,"" and most fit bits and pieces of several. Yes, there are ""popular girls"" and ""sexually active band geeks"" and ""JV jocks,"" but the masses exist between the obvious stereotypes  the opposite of the high school movie, in which the protagonist is the only different, diverse and interesting character swimming through a sea of stereotypes. No doubt ""types"" populate our high schools, but ever since John Hughes' The Breakfast Club told us that ""You see us as you want to see us  in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions,"" this arrangement has ironically been taken for gospel. What's worse is that this theory of the high school social milieu has become the standard narrative to ""understanding"" school violence, even when the classifying of groups isn't relevant. At its best, the high school movie transcends its setting, using high school as a metaphor for something larger (think Alexander Payne's Election); mostly, though, films from this genre have become basically naive versions of Robert Altman movies. Mean Girls thrusts Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), the new girl who was raised in Africa by missionary parents, into the sexually charged world of the suburban high school  so sexually charged, in fact, that the first thing the bespectacled math teacher (Fey herself) does is take off her spilled-upon shirt in front of the class. Cady is befriended by fringe homosexuals Janis and"
206,SMA_Doc6_Mean_Girls,SMA_Doc6_Mean_Girls,SMA,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"Just as we'd grown fed up with kids' cliched meanness in movies -- even the otherwise sweet 13 Going on 30 had it -- along comes Mean Girls to set us straight. It's not the concept that's been flawed, but the execution. From script to performances, everything works here, like, totally. Mean Girls' haughty high school princesses in a Heathers-style clique may echo the callous cruelty of countless teen flicks, but they're portrayed with detached amusement and subverted with warmth. Our heroine is Cady (Lindsay Lohan), who's been home-schooled all her life while in Africa with researcher parents. When they move to the United States, she sets foot in the jungle of high school for the first time, and it doesn't help that she's so naive she thinks Ashton Kutcher is a band. Though Cady is a nice, bright kid, she's snared in the web of the regal ""Plastics."" Projecting sexy superiority, they're the three most popular girls in school -- or perhaps just the most feared. Flaunting attitude and beauty as weapons of seduction or intimidation, the Plastics are led by Regina (Rachel McAdams). Being vanity and disdain incarnate, Regina has comeuppance coming. So Cady, plotting with two friends, pretends to be enthralled so she can gain enough ""411"" (information) to exact justice. The problem is she starts going native, caught between doing the right thing and enjoying her prima-donna status. Besides, Cady longs for a handsome boy who's connected to the clique, and it wouldn't help to join the geeky ""Mathletes,"" no matter how brainy she is. A spry cast that's clearly in on the jokes is ably guided by director Mark Waters, who also helmed Lohan's Freaky Friday and whose brother wrote Heathers. But the most credit should go to Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey. She adapted the script from author Rosalind Wiseman's Queen Bees and Wannabes and plays a no-nonsense teacher. With colorful characters and snappy performances, Mean Girls is a rare laugh-out-loud film. That's largely due to dialogue that's so clever we'd laugh just reading the script. With lines like ""It just kept coming up like word vomit"" and ""Regina's like the Barbie doll I never had,"" Fey has a hip handle on teens' reference points and the hollow beauty standards they embrace. But she's not embittered so much as bemused. Like Cady, Fey is a problem-solver, not a whiner, and Mean Girls is all about fun, not shrill condemnation or weary resignation about the overstated realities of young life. Lohan regains her stride after misfiring in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, which also used teen cruelty, but as a given, not a target. Lohan captures her character's ambivalence, and it's good to see her with a dignified beauty, not the coarse styles she flaunted in Drama Queen and Freaky Friday. Of course, she has her own mean-girl image because of her recent feud with actress Hilary Duff. But Lohan reminds us in this film that she still can be the sweet girl who"
207,SMA_Doc7_Mean_Girls,SMA_Doc7_Mean_Girls,SMA,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls,"Teenage girls can be red in tooth and claw, in case you hadn't gotten the pop-culture memo. Films like Catherine Hardwicke's Thirteen and books like Rosalind Wiseman's Queen Bees & Wannabes have thrown a harsh light on teen girls' yearning for acceptance and struggles with self-esteem; Tina Fey, head writer on Saturday Night Live, read Wiseman's book, and Fey's resulting screenplay was so inspired by Queen Bees that Wiseman gets a screen credit. Mean Girls, which opened with surprisingly big numbers, may tap into the same zeitgeist that seeks to decode the unhappy daughters of a new generation. It's also considerably witty, with freshly conceived characters and a baroquely structured plot. Lindsay Lohan, whose popularity may be part of the reason for Mean Girls' success, is Cady Heron, a homeschooled girl attending a public school for the first time. Cady doesn't know the social rules of high school, though her new friends, outcast ""art freaks"" Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese), waste no time filling her in. Tina Fey, who is Class of 1988 like me, must've been as relieved  and as dispirited  as I was to learn that high-school cliques haven't changed much in fifteen years. The Queen Bee clique, derisively known as The Plastics, are a trio of well-appointed brats  airhead Karen (Amanda Seyfried), eager-to-please Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), and ringleader Regina (Rachel McAdams). They take notice of Cady, and Regina invites her into the fold, with Janis' enthusiastic approval  Cady is in the perfect covert-op position to report back to Janis on the Plastics' vapidity. Mean Girls is not just for teenage girls. For one thing, Fey and producer Lorne Michaels have brought along some fellow SNL talent  Tim Meadows as the grouchy school principal, Ana Gasteyer as Cady's anthropologist mom (her line ""Why are my tribal vases under the sink?"" is one of Fey's finer moments as a writer), and the incomparable Amy Poehler as Regina's mom, a teenage daughter's worst nightmare  the mom who wants to be one of the girls. This is perhaps the smartest film Michaels has had his name on; Cady is a math whiz, and the movie doesn't shy away from showing actual examples of her knowledge. Fey wants girls to know it's okay to be smart, and the subplot in which Cady dumbs herself down to win the affection of a hunky senior (Jonathan Bennett) is a good instance of Fey's unstressed message. Elsewhere, particularly towards the finish, the script gets a little preachier. Fey herself, in the role of Cady's calculus teacher, stands in front of an auditorium full of girls and makes a speech: ""You've got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it all right for guys to call you that."" An inarguable sentiment, but it veers too close to a PSA for me, as does Cady's later revelation, ""Calling somebody else fat will not make you any thinner. Calling somebody stupid will not make you any"

But Fey is also ""SNL's"" head writer, which means she approves an awful lot of bad material for every episode. Luckily, we get the funny Tina Fey  the smart, clever, painfully insightful one  in ""Mean Girls,"" the film she wrote and has a supporting role in. It is inspired by Rosalind Wiseman's book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes,"" a nonfiction work about the social structures of teenage girls, and how adults can navigate them. Fey used the book's principles and her own memories of high school to construct a screenplay that is as sharply perceptive as anything we've seen since NBC canceled ""Freaks and Geeks."" It's what would happen if you took a John Hughes film, removed the sap, heightened the laughs, and pitched everything just a wee bit darker. Lindsay Lohan, of ""Freaky Friday"" and the unfortunate ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" (of which ""Mean Girls"" is the polar opposite, intelligence-wise), plays Cady Heron, a 16-year-old daughter of research zoologists who is entering the public school system for the first time, having been tutored heretofore by her parents while living in Africa. As a newcomer not just to North Shore High School but to high school in general, she has a clean slate and soon realizes, with the aid of misfit Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and too-gay-for-words Damian (Daniel Franzese), that she must choose her social circles wisely. She measures up favorably in the eyes of Regina George (Rachel McAdams), leader of the Plastics, a trio of girls who are the prettiest, richest females in the junior class. Regina and her associates, Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried), manipulate the entire class, and keep a scrapbook of sorts in which they paste girls' pictures and write gossip about them. They are feared, loved, venerated and hated by all of their female classmates. (""One time Regina punched me in the face,"" says one girl in a to-the-camera testimonial. ""It was awesome."") Provided she follows the rules  wear pink on Friday, don't join the math club, etc.  Cady is allowed to socialize with them. This suits her: She, Janis and Damian want to infiltrate their ranks, learn their secrets, and destroy them. It begins well enough, as they employ sabotage and subterfuge to get the Plastics fighting amongst themselves, and to get Regina in a fix with her current boy-toy, the dreamy Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). Unfortunately, in the process of acting, thinking and talking like a Plastic, Cady slowly becomes one. She becomes a Mean Girl. The best laughs are in the first half of the film, as the habits of teenagers are trenchantly observed and dissected by Janis and Damian. Cady often compares her classmates to wild animals  they're what she knows best, after all, given her upbringing  and finds more similarities than differences.

Consider ""Mean Girls,"" then, to be this spring's ""Heathers,"" the 1989 dark comedy that has become the touchstone for all movies about high school cliques. It's not a rip-off in the least but a timely variation  so attuned to the nuances of today's teenage world, for girls in particular, that its emotional accuracy qualifies as brilliance. There seems to be one clear person to praise for this, and her identity may surprise you. ""Mean Girls""  about a homeschooled 15-year-old named Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), who transfers to a public high school and gets eaten alive by the unfamiliar social structure  was written by Tina Fey, the ""Saturday Night Live"" scribe and news anchor who has a supporting role as a teacher here. ""Mean Girls"" seethes with experience, the sort of feminine ire that's more likely to come from Fey than director Mark Waters, who previously worked with Lohan on the hit remake ""Freaky Friday."" Yet no matter where the film's inspiration derives from  and maybe it's simply born of that collaborative alchemy that creates movie magic  there's no denying the result. ""Mean Girls"" dissects contemporary adolescence with withering precision. When Cady, a pretty and polite newcomer, arrives at North Shore High School in suburban Chicago, a few groups immediately try to claim her. Among them is a pair of outcasts  the proudly gay Damian (Daniel Franzese) and the bitter punk Janis (Lizzy Caplan)  who lay out the social landscape for Cady. At the top of the food chain are the Plastics, a trio of perfectly manicured girlfriends who lord over the school like royalty. When the Plastics try to adopt Cady, Damian and Janis suggest she go ""undercover"" to report back on how shallow they really are. Popularity, however, proves to be far more seductive than any of them realize. ""Mean Girls"" has a lacerating wit, as quick as ""Saturday Night Live"" at its best. When the movie takes a tour of the school's cliques  a staple of this sort of film  it has an extra bite. We don't just get the jocks and burnouts, for example, but also the ""sexually active band geeks."" More probing is its exploration of the image-obsessed mind of a modern high school girl. As the Plastics  played by Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried  ruthlessly criticize each inch of their own bodies, Cady says, ""I used to think there was just fat and skinny."" How did they get this way? The movie offers a satirical answer when it shows the little sister of one of the Plastics practicing the dance moves to a music video. Later, we glimpse her watching something that looks like ""Girls Gone Wild."" Adolescence is hard enough for girls, Fey seems to be saying,"

The new vehicle for Lindsay Lohan, who scored such a success in the remake of ""Freaky Friday,"" is especially impressive when compared to her last movie, ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,"" which was based on essentially the same premise but turned into a silly, irritating mess. Perhaps it's the presence of director Mark Waters, who also helmed ""Friday,"" that makes the difference. But more likely it's the fact that the script is the work of Tina Fey, the ""Saturday Night Live"" Weekend Update anchor who brings her customary barbed wit, moderated by a slightly ditsy charm, to the familiar material. The result doesn't quite match the classics of the genre--the happily goofy ""Clueless"" on the one hand or the darkly humorous ""Heathers"" on the other--but given the recent dismal competition in the field, it's a breath of fresh air (as well as the only tolerable movie Lorne Michaels has produced in many years--perhaps ever). Lohan plays Cady Heron, a naive kid who shows up as a junior at a suburban Chicago high school after being home-taught by her zoologist parents (Ana Gasteyer and Neil Flynn) during their years in Africa. From two fringe members of the class, punky Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and ostentatiously gay Damian (Daniel Franzese), she gets the lowdown on the different social groupings of the students, crystalized in their seating arrangements in the cafeteria. Surprisingly enough, Cady is invited to join the pinnacle among them--the Plastics, the local princesses consisting of queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and her obliging servants, rich but insecure Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and airhead bombshell Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). At Lizzy's urging, Cady takes them up on the offer, but only so she can collect information that can be used against them. Though a good kid, she's impelled to agree to the scheme when Regina sabotages her effort to attract hunky math classmate Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett), who happens to have been Regina's boyfriend once upon a time. Eventually she sows discord among the trio, but eventually Regina figures things out and mounts a counterattack that leads to chaos on campus and a feel-good finale (at the prom, no less) that preaches the evils of backbiting and the joy of respecting others. What's amazing is that Fey has been able to concoct a genuinely spiky and amusing scenario from Rosalind Wiseman's ""Queen Bees and Wannabees,"" which was essentially a self-help book for parents, using narrative materials that are fundamentally cliched and predictable. She does so by giving an unusual spin to the ordinary components.

Another is the unassuming, easy-going chemistry between its two leads, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. Bullock plays Loretta Sage, a romance novelist whose best sellers have handed her a house worthy of a Nancy Meyers movie, but whose heart remains locked down, having been widowed several years ago. Tatum is Alan ""Dash"" Caprison, her cover-boy model, a faux-Fabio with flowing locks, chiseled good looks and an appropriately puffy shirt. A movie poster for ""The Lost City"" A movie poster for ""The Lost City"" However, not all her fans are middle-aged women  or, as the picture condescendingly terms them, women in their 30s who wish they were in their 20s. Her books have also attracted the attention of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), a rich-kid nut job who thinks the writer can help him find the titular lost city and its accompanying treasure. To that end, he kidnaps Loretta and, just like that (as Carrie Bradshaw devotees might say), Loretta is unwillingly caught up in an adventure worthy of one of her romance novels. Enter our hero. Not, at first, Loretta's would-be rescuer, Dash, who is smitten with her, but a dashing guy named Jack Trainer, played with hilarious derring-do by Brad Pitt. Pitt's only on board for an extended cameo, but he wakes the movie up, so that, despite its obvious debt to older, better romantic comedies/adventures (""Romancing the Stone"" being the most obvious model), the picture settles into its own entertaining groove. Bullock and Channing are both dedicated, adept performers who realize they aren't recreating ""The African Queen,"" but give the uneven script their best shot. And their best is a good deal better than good enough. There's some welcome feminist humor (""You mean I'm the damsel in distress"" Dash demands at one point) that blends well with the film's more traditional tropes. And everyone seems to be in the same movie, though Radcliffe's character sometimes edges into over-the-top Austin Powers villainy (the script's fault, not the actor's). A movie like this can go wrong in so many ways and, until Pitt shows up, it occasionally does. Still, there's an unforced breeziness here  a welcome self-awareness that pulls off the seemingly impossible. Namely, a film that plays by Old School rules without coming off as dated or dumb (well, not too dumb). Bullock, Tatum and company haven't reinvented the wheel, but they've greased it just fine. Let's be grateful for small pleasures."
212,TPB_Doc2_Lost_City,TPB_Doc2_Lost_City,TPB,Comedy,Negative,Lost_City,"If you squint, you might recognise a slew of better films that the creators of ""The Lost City"" may have had in mind as they worked on developing Sandra Bullock's latest 'action, romantic comedy'. Certainly, the film is rarely romantic, only fleetingly comedic and its action set-pieces are underwhelming. But you can make out some faint glimmer of what it might be attempting. For a film with four credited script-writers and an additional fifth person with a ""story by"" credit, most of what ""The Lost City"" could or might be, is eclipsed by the aggressive nothingness of what it is  an incredibly tepid film experience. A writer in her late-fifties finds herself thrust into an unlikely romance with a younger man. That's actually the plot for Nancy Meyer's ""Something's Gotta Give"", where Diane Keaton finds herself navigating potential romance with a younger Keanu Reeves and an older Jack Nicholson. But it did occur to me while watching, ""The Lost City"" where Sandra Bullock plays Loretta, a late-fifties writer who finds herself in an unlikely potential romance with a younger man (played by Channing Tatum) how different romance, or the illusion of it, looks like when a movie actually has something to say. And it's anyone's guess what, if anything, ""The Lost City"" has to say. The bones of the plot are straightforward enough  Loretta is a widow who writes romance novels and is on a book tour when she's kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax, a nefarious billionaire looking for a lost city with an allegedly priceless treasure. Loretta's historical research with her deceased archaeologist husband has Fairfax convinced she can help him locate the treasure. In an attempt to convince Loretta of his devotion, her cover model (Tatum as Alan) embarks on a rescue mission to the remote Atlantic Island. Chaos ensues, then adventure and then romance. If that all sounds like a vaguely clumsy set-up for a film with so many writers, it's not the only case of ""The Lost City"" feeling defined by a general noncommittal energy. It's a perplexing tone for a film that carries a lot of weight. In a 'post-pandemic' world, the question of whether audiences will venture out to cinemas for anything beyond the spectacle of superhero fantasy is a big question. And the intentions of a mid-budget romantic comedy, led by a woman (Bullock also produces this) is a great idea. A world with more romantic comedies on the big-screen is a better world, especially ones that honour women over fifty. Yet, little of anything in ""The Lost City"" feels as exciting, or innovative or engaging as that potential might be. Is it a radical point to say that a film must both be romantic and comedic before it's allowed to market itself as a romantic comedy? Theoretically, it shouldn't, but increasingly the films going by the romcom moniker seem dispossessed of either the 'rom' or the 'com' leaving us with interminable sludges that elicit an ambivalent ""ummm"" more than anything.

We haven't broken all the stigmas around it quite yet. Still, we're getting there, and a film like The Lost City gaining well-received reception also plays a part in paving a better road for embracing feel-good and heartwarming adventures that end with a happily ever after. While The Lost City is more in line with films like The Mummy or Jungle Cruise in recent years, its careful attention to detailing a romance novelist's importance is where it succeeds beyond Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum's ridiculously joyful chemistry. There's a specific scene where Tatum's character Alan, the cover model for Bullock's Loretta Sage's novels, mentions how he was ashamed of the position at first but realized he should embrace it after seeing the amount of happiness the stories bring to the readers. It remains a tragic truth that romance readers have long hidden their books and love for the genre in various social spheres. It is also still very much not as renowned as a genre in scholarly studies either. And for the longest time, happy endings have been deemed cliches that should not be considered ""good writing"" despite the detail that it's one of the top-selling genres yearly. Thereby, Alan's decision to embrace the genre and everything that comes with it beautifully encapsulates the shift that's been taking place lately, with more fans showing off their favorite novels with pride than shame. Removing words like ""trash"" from our discourse and loving these books openly as opposed to telling people they should ""read (or in this case, watch) something more realistic."" The Lost City is far from a real adventure, but it made people laugh out loud countless times in the theater while allowing them to leave feeling a little bit better than when they walked in. And what this line in particular does is it openly enables a man to embrace a genre that's predominantly read and embraced by women. A film like The Lost City isn't going to change everyone's mind. No, that would be unrealistic to believe, but what it can do is be an exhibition of the fact that the romance genre can be honored more often than not. We can walk into theaters expecting silly adventures that'll fill us with joy and find ourselves thoroughly impressed with the outright decision to praise romance. If nothing else, the film attempts to ensure that both readers and writers know that they should be proud of the joy that comes from consuming content that's wholesome. As one of the queens of romantic comedies, Bullock's role as a romance novelist feels especially fitting. To have the character embody what"

That's the charm that barely holds The Lost City together. Sandra Bullock plays an ex-archaeologist-turned-romance novel writer. Channing Tatum plays her cover model. As Bullock embarks on a publicity tour for what she declares will be her final novel, frustrations mount as the cover model who's built a career off her novel's successes doesn't want to see it come to an end all while her publisher (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) struggles to keep her empire afloat. Yet, it isn't either of these two combative situations that drive the narrative. Instead, it's a unscrupulous rich kid (Daniel Radcliffe) mad at his father for giving his fortune and businesses over to his younger brother who kidnaps Bullock and holds her hostage. He hopes that her ancient pictographic linguistic knowledge will help him locate the legendary Crown of Fire artifact from the very civilization she details at the heart of her latest book. Tatum witnesses her abduction and gets an acquaintance (Brad Pitt) he met at a wellness retreat to help mount her rescue. Ineptitude ensues and all the familiar beats of such storylines hit as expected. While the comedy of the film mostly works, the screenplay is bereft of inventiveness, forcing the audience to rely on the chemistry between Bullock and Tatum to hold their attention for the film's duration. What helps this is that Bullock and Tatum seem to be having fun with the material. Their stereotypical characters give no room for variant interpretation, but both still engage honestly with the various hysterical set pieces to give the audience a fun, if superficial, time. For their part, Radcliffe and Randolph are also enjoying the material, Randolph giving voice to an exasperated woman doing what she can to salvage the situation while Radcliffe chews into the paper thin villain with relish, nearly earning the audience's sympathy. Yet, it's Pitt that adds the best, most unexpected spark to his segment of the film. As an experienced ex-military tracker, Pitt's character embodies all the elements of Bullock's written protagonist, potentially pre-empting the wannabe savior that Tatum is trying to become. Ultimately, the The Lost City is relatively hollow with a somewhat uncharacteristic denouement that connects back to Bullock's late husband and her inability to let him go. After that, the resolution is straight forward and surprisingly lacking in excitement, which makes the film go out with a whimper rather than a bang. The comedy that led up to the finale is all the audience has to sustain it, but that is all it needs to be ultimately entertaining."

Not just in a general sense, but a very specific sense: Big-budget, superstar-led studio movies are back to entice you from your homes and into cinemas. For proof, look no further than this coming weekend's big release, Paramount's ""The Lost City."" This film has gorgeous exotic locations, plenty of fun banter, a grand old-school adventure score, and four megastars (Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, and Channing Tatum) for the price of one. Of course, these films returning means that their shortcomings are also back, but ""The Lost City"" does such a good job with the comfort-food basics of popcorn entertainment that its built-in shortcomings don't matter so much. Loretta Sage (Bullock) is a best-selling romance novelist whose series of ""Lovemore & Dash"" novels uses the real history she uncovered with her archeologist husband as a backdrop for steamy sex. But ever since her husband died, Loretta has been in a rut. She barely finishes her latest novel, ""The Lost City of D,"" in time for the book tour her publisher Beth (the delightful Da'vine Joy Randolph) has spent all of her time and energy organizing. Given her reclusive nature, she's forced to do interviews with her cover model Alan (Tatum), who she hates. She barely gets through one interview before being kidnapped by the eccentric billionaire Fairfax (Radcliffe), who believes she can help him find the treasure of the actual ""Lost City"" on an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Desperate to prove that he's more than just a buff bod and strong jawline, Alan goes to rescue her, enlisting the help of a former Marine he met at a wellness retreat (Pitt). The set-up brings to mind any number of past Hollywood romantic comedy adventure films, most notably Robert Zemeckis's ""Romancing the Stone."" Directors Aaron and Adam Nee (""Band of Robbers"") don't have to work too hard to emulate the breezy fun of those films. ""The Lost City"" is exceedingly light on its feet, and Bullock naturally adds a certain amount of tartness that cuts through the sweetness of every film she's in. She and Tatum have classic screwball comedy odd-couple chemistry that elevates the zippy script. (And while we're at it, let's give Bullock a hand for consistently bucking the Hollywood trend and having rom-com love interests younger than her.) Unfortunately, as with most films of this ilk, the comedy gets a bit lost in the third act, when the adventure plot comes to a head and takes over the film's tone. When the adventure plot is as uninspired as it is here, that would usually be a problem. Credit is due to screenwriters the Nees, Dana Fox, and Oren Uziel, for concluding the adventure plot with a neat little twist that serves to further the film's theme and character development. The performers deserve credit, too, for adding just enough personality to make that development feel more genuine (and less rote) than it does on the page. It's easy to take"
216,TPB_Doc6_Lost_City,TPB_Doc6_Lost_City,TPB,Comedy,Negative,Lost_City,"Am not sure what director brothers Adam Nee, and Aaron Nee had in mind when they first started making ""The Lost City."" To me, it felt like it started off as a prank, where one of them might have suggested an idea of roping in Brad Pitt for a super-cool cameo as a sexy, undercover guy named Jack Trainer in what would essentially be an unofficial remake of Robert Zemeckis' gleefully pulpy but wholly watchable action-adventure ""Romancing the Stone."" Then, they might have decided to cast the super-dashing Channing Tatum to play out an extension of his dumbfoolery from the Jump Street movies, and Sandra Bullock as well, Sandra Bullock from all her 90s movies. The result would make a fairly entertaining movie that would glide along on their chemistry alone. However, what we do get here is an over-stretched, unfunny, and terribly written film that doesn't know if it wants to be a treasure hunt adventure, a reworking of the damsel in distress trope, a moving-on from a grief tale, or a rom-com that ends with a kiss. Related to The Lost City  Army Of Thieves [2021] Netflix Review  A Bland Prequel To Zack Snyder's Army Of The Dead Anyway, Bullock stars as Loretta, a reclusive novelist who writes these pulpy treasure hunting adventures that are less treasure hunting and more of a sexually charged romance between Angela and Dash (the main characters from her book). We meet her first in the midst of her frustration as she dodges her agent Beth's (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) calls to finish the final chapter of her new book. We get to know that it has been 5 years since her husband passed away, and instead of moving on, she has decided to limit her interactions. This is why, a book tour that involves interacting with people in a body-hugging-sparkly-jump-suit-dress, has to be the last place she wants to be. However, when there, we also meet Dash (basically Channing Tatum's Alan donning fake blond hair), who apparently has a thing for her, but is unable to connect because of a sort of intellectual shield that Loretta has built around her. Alan, who considers himself dumb is unable to traverse around that. But, before things could get sex-cringe, Loretta is kidnapped by some hoodlums who apparently work for Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). Please note that this character makes sure to tell us that this is a gender-neutral name and that you are not allowed to make fun of it (Me: It's 2022, and no one is making fun of it anymore). Anyway, Abigail tries to reason with Loretta about a piece of key information in her book that might help him find some sort of hidden treasure, but Loretta, who has left reading cryptic messages since her husband died, is reluctant and uptight. So, our baddy decides to drug her (note that this character likes cheese for no reason whatsoever) and fly her to the middle of the Atlantic. Parallelly, Loretta's assistant,"

If you are going to make a movie about a romance novelist (Sandra Bullock) who winds up going on a romantic adventure similar to those in her novels, go ahead and remake Romancing the Stone, which came out, good god, 38 years ago. What? Did I see that in a theater? I need to take a moment ... I'm having a major bout of ""feeling old as all shit."" I'm going to take a brief walk and calm down. The Lost City is obviously an attempt at making a new Stone, but given how lame the finished product is, they would've been better off just remaking the original, or pulling a Ghostbusters: Afterlife retrofit reboot by making Sandra Bullock the daughter of Kathleen Turner's author from the originalbecause The Lost City has the same plot. But, no. Producers must think nobody in The Lost City target audience has even heard of Romancing the Stone, so they just re-made the movie, with a different name and characters. No need to acknowledge Stone. Romancing the Stone was enjoyable, but hackneyed, and that franchise played out after the less-successful sequel, The Jewel of the Nile. Films like Six Days, Seven Nights, starring Harrison Ford and Anne Heche, tried for a similar vibe in the late '90s, but did little to keep the genre alive. Wait ... when did Six Days, Seven Nights come out? Nearly a quarter-century ago? OK, hang on; I have to take another walk and regroup. Let me wrangle the dog. Perhaps the rom-com-adventure film was due for a fresh take, but The Lost City is anything but fresh: In every beat, it's a movie you have seen before. Bullock's author, Loretta, is kidnapped by a whiny rich guy (Daniel Radcliffe) who discovers a legit clue to a secret tomb he's been seeking while reading her books. Tatum plays the Fabio-like cover model who flies into action to rescue her. (Fabio jokes were old 30 years ago.) He enlists the help of a hero-type guy (Brad Pitt, apparently doing somebody a favor by appearing in this), and they form a rescue plan. The rescue attempt is hapless, and wannabe hilarity ensues. We get a scene in which leeches get into Tatum's pants. (Hello, Stand By Me! Let's rip you off, too.) We get Bullock and Tatum running around many locationscheaply created by CGI. Pitt provides the film's only real laughs, making about 10 minutes of this film enjoyable. While the movie is milquetoast, Bullock and Tatum do make an appealing screen couple. They both have searching, simple qualities to their line deliveries that they've mastered; there are good moments between them that will make you wish they were in a better movie. It's also refreshing to see a Hollywood pairing with an older woman and a younger man. (Bullock is 16 years older than Tatum.) Their"

But that promise fades as ""The Lost City"" begins to spin its wheels. Despite the best efforts of its talented cast, the film cannot sustain the momentum of its promising start and meanders along at a sluggish clip. In ""The Lost City,"" Sandra Bullock plays Loretta, a romance-adventure writer struggling with her latest book and still mourning the death of her archaeologist husband. She finally finishes the book and reluctantly heads out on a book tour with Alan (Channing Tatum), the cover model for the main character in Loretta's book series. Loretta is kidnapped at one book tour stop by an eccentric billionaire named Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He is searching for a hidden treasure and is convinced Loretta can help him find it because her books incorporate actual research she did with her deceased husband. Fairfax takes Loretta to a remote jungle, with Alan following behind  determined to rescue her and finally confess his true feelings. If this sounds familiar  ""Romancing the Stone,"" anyone?  it really is because it plays all the same beats as previous films in the genre. While Bullock and Tatum have enough chemistry to make this work, and the willingness to do anything for a laugh, they never connect the way that the screenplay  credited to four writers including co-directors Adam Nee and Aaron Nee  clearly wants them to. Radcliffe also tries really hard, and like the two leads is clearly having a blast, but his character is severely under-cooked  with the performance basically just a series of angry marches. The brightest moments come courtesy of a pair of smaller roles from Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Brad Pitt. Randolph plays Loretta's gung-ho publicist  a woman determined to protect her client at any cost. She provides ""Lost City"" with a few humorous moments. Pitt basically steals the film, however, as a mysterious special ops guy named Jack hired by Alan to rescue Loretta. Pitt's performance is hilarious, a meta turn as the embodiment of the romantic hero. Every moment Pitt is on screen, ""The Lost City"" is at its very best. Unfortunately, his screen time is minimal at best. Once his character exits, ""Lost City"" never recovers, falling into a rinse-and-repeat pattern that we've seen many times before."

In Paramount's newest movie The Lost City, Sandra Bullock is back at the top of the romantic comedy world as Loretta Sage, a reclusive, but wildly popular romance novelist. Following the release of a novel about a fabled lost city, Sage is kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) who believes she can lead him to the real Lost City of D. It's up to her himbo cover model, Alan Caprison, played by the always hilarious and charming Magic Mike alum Channing Tatum, and former Navy SEAL Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to rescue her. The adventure is action-packed, full of tender romance between hot actors, and one of the funniest films you'll see in theaters this year. In fact, it's one of the funniest rom-coms you'll have seen in years. The film has a stacked cast that not only includes Bullock, Tatum, Pitt, and Radcliffe, but also features scene-stealing roles by queer comedians Bowen Yang and Patti Harrison! Of course, these two have been stealing scenes in every project they're in, but still, the two actors were definite highlights in this A+ movie. Yang appears early in the film as the host of a Q&A event with the author and her cover model promoting her latest book. Yang adds a delightful amount of queer thirst to his scene, getting laughs with every line he has. Harrison plays Allison, Loretta's recently hired social media manager who has several of the best lines in the film, which, once again, is full of great lines and jokes. Harrison perfectly portrays the detached chaotic nature of millennial workers and will make you laugh out loud over and over again. These two young stars are quickly becoming some of the most in-demand stars in Hollywood, making everything they're in a lot better. The Lost City is a perfect example. You take an already excellent comedy and add Yang and Harrison, and you have one of the best movies of the year. Yang, Out's current cover star, made history when he became Saturday Night Live's first featured player (newer performers who aren't main cast members) to be nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor. Next up, he's taking over movies. He's set to star in the film Fire Island alongside Joel Kim Booster as a pair of best friends who embark on a weeklong vacation to the famous gay vacation spot. He'll also be appearing in Bros, the Billy Eichner gay romantic comedy produced by Judd Apatow. After getting an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her role in the Sundance dramedy Together Together, Harrison made the cover of Teen Vogue and is set to appear in another upcoming comedy Mack & Rita with Diane Keaton and Elizabeth Lail. The Lost City, directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, also stars Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Oscar Nunez, and is in theaters now."

Being a trouper, Loretta suits up into her uncomfortable glittery purple jumpsuit (it's on loan) and begrudgingly puts on a fake smile onstage next to Alan (Channing Tatum), the well-meaning but dimwitted (and yes, hot) himbo cover model who portrays the hunky leading man of Loretta's books, Dash McMahon. As if leaving her house in the first place weren't bad enough, Loretta is mysteriously kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), the psychotic child of a billionaire media mogul locked in a Succession-like feud with his more successful siblings. Somehow, it gets even more twisted: Abigail is hellbent on discovering the ""Crown of Fire"" in the middle of a remote Atlantic island, and believes Loretta is the only one who can decipher the treasure map. Secretly in love with her, Alan hops on a plane and enlists the help of Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to rescue Loretta from Abigail's monied clutches, deep within the jungle. While the explosive, action-packed sequences are a lot of fun, and an essential element of the adventure genre, what sets The Lost City apart from recent, more tired blockbuster adventure/comedy fare (looking at you, Uncharted) is the humorously human moments that lead to a genuine connection between Loretta, Alan and the audience. Instead of falling back on the kind of semi-ironic ""so, that happened"" style of fourth-wall-breaking writing, directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee take familiar adventure/rom-com cornerstones and repurpose them to find previously undiscovered gems through these personal moments. They are certainly aware of the tropes being toyed with heredumb guy/smart lady romance, the frame story of Loretta's novels, the treasure-hunting villianbut they approach these tropes with a freshness that gets the audience invested in its characters. The choice to play Alan as a loveable dummy with a surprising amount of tender insight is much more interesting than the usual emotionally repressed macho action hero, or a sarcastic know-it-all rolling his eyes and winking at the audience. Not only is it funny watching Alan fumble his way through the jungle, it's also endearing when he reveals himself to be more than what Loretta sees on the surface. What Alan lacks in street smarts, he makes up for in emotional intelligence and a gentle spirit; Tatum isn't afraid to play that for laughs, either. ""Don't judge a book by its cover model,"" he tells Loretta by the fire. This adage also applies to audience perceptions of the film overall: Don't be too quick to turn your nose up at The Lost City because of its blockbuster gloss and trite trailer, for so many treasures await beneath the surface.

With a near-epic running time of nearly three hours, No Time to Die certainly moves at a clip, sweeping along at a thrilling pace from bulletproof Aston Martins to poisonings in Havana nightclubs to ex-Soviet bunkers, and all under director Cary Fukunaga's stylish eye. A series of action setpieces, from Bond's makeshift bungee jump off a crumbling bridge to his effortless hijacking of a motorbike, are filmed with breathtakingly dynamic roving cameras. During a romantic Italian holiday, we first find Bond summering with Dr Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux, expressive and capable, the antithesis of the 'Bond girl'), the woman he loves but who has an enigmatic history. Naturally  this being Bond  the idyll can't last long; imposing and mysterious threats are soon closing in from all sides, usually in the form of men with knives in their teeth and grenades to lob. Phantoms emerge not only from Bond's own past, but from the pasts of many of his closest allies and friends. Meanwhile, Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), 007's greatest enemy and head of the shadowy Spectre, is up to no good. Another baddie with an axe to grind makes himself known in the form of Safin (Rami Malek, forbidding and self-contained), an enormously creepy foe with a penchant for bio-warfare. Read More - Featured Image Read More On set with the No Time to Die cast: 'Bond is not what he used to be: A misogynist' No Time to Die is a movie not only obsessed by its characters' personal histories, but by its own; it has every inclination to wear its homages to the series on its Brioni sleeve, from its frequent musical interludes (they never get old) to its rather surprising choice to bring back the Sixties-flavour Bond quip (these sometimes do get old). But the film really soars when it is smartly combining the old with the new, as with the introduction of new MI6 agent (Lashana Lynch, a commanding, though still thoroughly supporting presence) who has been granted the '007' number during Bond's temporary retirement, much to his displeasure.

222,UIY_Doc2_No_Time_to_Die,UIY_Doc2_No_Time_to_Die,UIY,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"""No Time to Die"" (2021) is the fifth and final James Bond movie starring Daniel Craig as everyone's favorite spy. Resuming where ""Spectre"" (2015) left off, Bond has retired until Felix Leiter persuades him to get back in the game and locate a scientist that Spectre kidnapped from an M16 laboratory. He discovers that Spectre is not the biggest game in town and returns home to get answers only to discover that past events did not unfold the way that he thought. As he reassesses his decisions, he must defend an old flame and her family from this bigger threat. I am not into Bond, but Craig so I was going to see ""No Time to Die"" whenever it got released, pandemic or not. With a two-hour forty-three minute run time, I went in a little daunted because as much as I like Craig, a three hour Bond movie does not sound like a good idea especially when ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) exists. The time flew by, and I am happy to report that it is an entertaining film that feels like an apology for Spectre's short-comings and satisfyingly concludes Craig's reign. While it is no ""Casino Royale"" (2006) or ""Skyfall"" (2012), I would watch it again. ""No Time to Die"" starts like a horror film. I never understood what the franchise saw in Madeleine Swann, Bond's latest love interest from ""Spectre,"" but in this film, the franchise finally fleshed out her character to get us invested in her plotline and retroactively made her careless actions in the prior installment make sense. If she has been fighting this long, you too would go for a walk without protection at night. It makes sense that this film got released in October because Swann as a final girl against the Boogeyman was more interesting than as the latest in a long line of women to fall for Bond's charms. I went from rolling my eyes over the trope that brunettes were bad, and blondes were good until this film. The writers and Lea Seydoux redeemed Swann by distinguishing her independently from her relationship with the protagonist. Even without Bond, I could appreciate her instinct for survival, severely missing though touted in her initial appearance in the prior installment. As a Bond film, ""No Time to Die"" pays homage to the franchise's mythology, and every recurring character has a moment in the spotlight. If you watch Bond movies to learn more about Bond than saving the world, then you may be pleased to know that it ties up a lot of loose ends for the character without sacrificing what we enjoy about the character. Craig's action sequences are memorable whether he is in a shootout in Cuba, pulling a Rambo in a stunning Norwegian forest sequence or fighting the baddie's henchmen on his island lair in the denouement. There is also a lot of unexpected humor amidst the pathos as years of fornicating finally catch up to him, and he faces the consequences"
223,UIY_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,UIY_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,UIY,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"Last September, Daniel Craig's swan song as James Bond was finally released after being held back nearly two years due to the global pandemic, making its title, No Time to Die, more than a little ironic. Directed and co-written by former UCSC slug Cary Fukunaga, No Time to Die is now available on home video just in time for the movie icon's 60th anniversary. That's six decades of Bond girls, Bond cars, Bond gadgets, Bond villains, and bad Bond puns. It's hard to believe, but it's been sixteen years since Daniel Craig first slipped into 007's tuxedo, and he's aged into the role beautifully. His debut as the ultimate spy in Casino Royal marked the first time the action franchise made an effort, however small, to modernize the series by broadening gender and racial representation, playing down Bond's misogyny, and playing up the character's psychological complexity. Craig, arguably the most talented Bond performer since Sean Connery, expresses more than just determination, anger, and self-satisfaction. He has deeper feelings  often conflicted. He's even capable of love. No Time to Die is an exciting final chapter for Craig's Bond, even though at close to three hours long the story does suffer from a little fat around the midriff. The same can't be said for Craig, who could easily compete against Brad Pitt for best male upper torso in the over-50 category. No Time to Die starts off with one of the most thrilling pre-credit sequences ever, and, clocking in at over twenty minutes, it's hands down the longest. There's a frightening home invasion that provides a backstory payoff later in the film, three death-defying stunts, and a car chase involving Bond driving the DB5 Aston Martin made famous in Goldfinger, complete with embedded arsenal, culminating with a nail-biting moment when it looks like bullet-proof glass won't be enough to save him. After the obligatory CGI-animated title sequence, accompanied by a disappointingly lethargic Billie Eilish song, the story picks up five years later; Bond is enjoying his retirement from MI6 in Jamaica, even though his enemies, old and new, are still at work. Christoph Waltz, in a scene straight out of The Silence of the Lambs, reprises his role as Blofeld, the ultimate puppet-master. A new threat comes in the form of Lyutsifer Safin, played by Rami Malik. Safin, with his creepy voice affectation and equally creepy complexion, is a fun throwback to classical bond villainy bent on upending the world order. Suffice to say, it doesn't take long for Bond to become reacquainted with his trusty Walther PPK. Bond sequels have always recycled elements from its predecessors. But No Time to Die, the 25th film in the franchise, reaches back half a century to borrow almost exclusively from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Many Bond aficionados consider it one of the best in the series, if not THE best, so the filmmakers could do worse. Nonetheless, pilfering so many ideas, and even the musical cues, from one particular film may be"

Everyone looks at No Time To Die as Daniel Craig's final go at interpreting the famous 007, but with all due respect to the remarkable actor I sincerely appreciate, it's much more than just that. Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation) is the man responsible for delivering a fond farewell to a saga that offered the viewers a collection of memorable characters, all beautifully portrayed by an exceptionally talented ensemble cast. Skyfall and Casino Royale are definitely a few steps above Spectre and Quantum of Solace, in my opinion, but where does this last entry fit in? I regularly clarify my expectations for the films I review before really starting to write about how I feel about them, but I honestly believe this is one of those movies that actually demands that preface. Since I don't watch trailers, my enthusiasm didn't really decrease after the countless delays due to the pandemic, so I was always genuinely interested in seeing this film. I was also prepared for the two most probable finales: either Bond would die in his last mission, or he would survive and live happily ever after. There wasn't much else that could really happen. One of the best compliments I can give No Time To Die is that I started the viewing hoping for one of these specific conclusions to be the one Fukunaga and his team of writers chose, but I gradually changed my mind to wish for the opposite scenario. If the movie really goes through with one of these finales or not is something I'll leave undisclosed in this review for obvious reasons. Still, my point is that Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Fukunaga, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Fleabag) are able to write the most passionate, heartfelt narrative of the entire franchise. This is, by far, the most personal a James Bond flick ever got. I didn't realize the genuine attachment I had with these characters, but this film showed it to me in an impactful manner. I'd be surprised if fans of this saga leave the theater feeling indifferent towards the events of the movie. From the choices each character makes to the incomparable stakes of the last mission, No Time To Die feels like a completely different beast. Let me start from the beginning... The energetic action present in the opening sequence rivals Casino Royale's impressive parkour run, but overall, counting everything that happens until the main theme begins playing and the credits appear, I believe this film delivers the best - and longest? - start to the whole saga. Not only it builds upon what was already developed with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) - setting up a couple of intriguing questions and a surprising decision from Bond - but it also features a gorgeously shot pursuit scene through a stunning city in southern Italy. Might as well praise the outstanding stunt work, extraordinary cinematography (Linus Sandgren), and seamless editing (Elliot Graham, Tom Cross) already."

After starring in 5 movies over the last 15 years, English actor Daniel Craig is done with James Bond. No Time To Die is Craig's final Bond outing, his swan song in many ways, as these 5 movies have connected with storylines playing out across each of them. And this final one wraps things up as best it can. Years ago when they rebooted with Casino Royale, Eon Productions decided to try making the new Bond movies with ongoing narratives. Almost every other movie before this era was just a standalone movie: Bond would go off on his important mission, take out the bad guy and save the day; everything would start fresh again with the next movie. Ever since Casino Royale in 2006, Bond has been dealing with the guilt and sadness of losing his great love, Vesper Lynd. And with this fifth movie, they've put themselves in a situation where they have to tie up all the loose ends and usher all these characters to a satisfying end point. What I've learned over the last 15 years of watching Bond movies is that everyone has a different experience with Bond. Some people grew up watching Sean Connery and prefer his style of Bond movies. Others never enjoyed the old Bond movies and only got into this new series when Casino Royale offered something different. Some people, like me and a few of my friends, are huge fans of all of the original Bond movies, yet recognize that Bond has evolved. The goofy, over-the-top ridiculous Bond of the Roger Moore era is fun, but not something that really works anymore. For me, the Daniel Craig era has been hit or miss - I love Skyfall the most, I enjoy Casino Royale, I don't like Spectre much, and Quantum of Solace is fairly forgettable. But this is just my connection with the series, and everyone has their own experiences with it. Meaning everyone will like or dislike No Time To Die on their own terms, no matter what critics or fans say. Nonetheless, it's definitely better than Spectre, and does its best to introduce new ideas while finishing up with Craig's Bond. It also seems Eon Productions wanted to explore different evolutions of Bond beyond No Time To Die. For many years, fans have been hoping that they'll cast a Black Bond or a Female Bond next time. It's clear they wanted to try both of those in this movie - Lashana Lynch co-stars as an MI6 agent named Nomi. When the movie begins, Bond is officially ""retired"" and no longer works for them anymore, so they've replaced him and MI6 has moved on. She plays an important role in the story because she's the asset that they send out instead, and eventually she meets Bond (who she is certainly aware of) and begins working with him for the rest of the movie. This happens very early on and isn't so much of a"
226,UIY_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,UIY_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,UIY,Action,Negative,No_Time_to_Die,"Cary Joji Fukunaga's No Time To Die is heavy-handed from the first scene, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) and his love-interest, Madeline (Lea Seydoux) glide across Europe like the protagonists in an Imtiaz Ali movie. Except there's no song playing in the background which underlines their 'free spirit' ways. As they enter (what looks like) a town in Italy, she teases him for looking over his shoulder. He denies it, and says something profound about the 'past'. We see locals burning tiny pieces of paper, which we're told are past regrets and secrets, as a ritual. Craig's Bond has been marinating in distrust and trauma since that climactic betrayal in Casino Royale, something that has arguably worked splendidly for the franchise, rooting it in real-world opacity. And to Craig's credit, he embodies the stiff upper-lipped Mi6 agent to perfection, instead of being the one firing zingers in every scene. Which is why it's shocking that the No Time To Die makers saddle him with melodramatic lines like ""We all have our secrets, we just didn't get to yours yet."" But then again, that's probably the 'pitch' of Fukunaga's film. Now, only if they had shown more conviction to deliver a sappy finale for Craig's final outing as James Bond. It's troubling how little No Time To Die does to separate itself from its predecessors. It's just another bloated Bond film, with call-backs from within the Bond franchise (since Craig got on board), 'exotic' landscapes, a supervillain with a God complex nursing genocidal ambitions. ""Just another day,"" Mallory tells Bond in one scene. There's the wry British humour on display, the umpteen close-ups of alcohol being served in a glass often gulped within seconds. Even the action scenes, though impressive in the moment, aren't particularly memorable like the parkour scene in Casino Royale. There's no weighty grief in the way Bond nurses a broken heart in Quantum of Solace, and surely none of the bitterness or existential dread from Skyfall. no time to die Far from bearing Fukunaga's signature on it, No Time To Die seems like a dish that the director cooked up from a bullet-point recipe using each of the studio executive's favourite ingredients. Some humour? Add some of Ana De Armas and Daniel Craig's playful chemistry from Knives Out . Some action? Let's blow things up - a street in Cuba, a sailboat, or even an island. Some 'progressive' posturing? Let's get Lashana Lynch as the new 007 to impress the liberals. The decision really does feel that shallow, especially the way they handle Lynch, characterising her as someone chasing her own tail based on Bond's leads. The treatment meted out to Lynch at least answers the question about whether she is going to be trusted with the franchise. Nope. Rami Malek, sporting a Noh mask and spotted skin, isn't nearly as creepy as his plain face in Mr Robot. Playing a character, who is an odd mix of Russian and Japanese heritage, means Malek gets ample room"
227,UIY_Doc7_No_Time_to_Die,UIY_Doc7_No_Time_to_Die,UIY,Action,Negative,No_Time_to_Die,"No Time to Die, the latest and last appearance of Daniel Craig as James Bond, is a lot of movie. It's so much movie that one hardly knows where to begin. So let's start with the runtime, which carries on for 165 minutes. Long movies don't deter me, assuming the time is well spent, but this one felt overstuffed. Director Cary Joji Fukanaga, the first American director to helm an entry in the franchise's 60-year history, gives the audience plenty to contemplate, and not all of it feels essential or necessary. Fukanaga and his posse of screenwritersincluding Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridgeconcoct a script chock full of elaborate plotting, drearily murky characters, and weighty themes. These writers have much to do, crafting the final Craig entry. Their screenplay must weave together the narrative threads from the last four movies, starting with Casino Royale (2006). They must consider the series' clandestine evil organizations and strained relationships, both personal and professional. At the same time, the audience expects rousing action sequences, death puns, and daring spycraft. Plus, unique to No Time to Die is a sense of closure and finality to the Craig run, ensuring that its star never has to return to the franchise he love-hates. As I mentioned, it's a lot. Devoted fans of the franchise will eat up this hardy helping of cinematic comfort food with a delirious smile, content that the filmmakers have planned a glorious final chapter for their hero. After nearly two years of delays due to the pandemic, the fact that we're seeing the movie at all seems like something that might've never happened. But here we are, and boy howdy, is it a lot. It's not merely the latest spy-actioner in the series; it's a sprawling and contemplative movie about the baggage we carry. Early in No Time to Die, Bond and his new lover from Spectre (2015), Madeline Swann (Lea Seydoux), vacation in the Mediterranean. She wants him to say goodbye to his past, namely Vesper, the femme fatale who broke his heart in Casino Royale, and only then will Madeline share her past. This is a movie obsessed with the past. Its characters have been scarred and remain unable to move beyond their histories. Eventually, Bond comes to terms with Vesper and her betrayal, but in doing so, he finds reason to suspect that Madeline works for the super-secret villain club, Spectre. Since he can no longer trust her, Bond leaves Madeline and retires to a beach in Jamaica. Five years pass, meaning the characters have stewed in their unresolved conflicts for half a decade. But their issues with the past go further back as well. In a pre-credits scene, a preadolescent Madeline finds her childhood home in Norway attacked by a masked man, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). To exact revenge for his family's murder, Lyutsifer wants to kill Mr. White, who is Madeline's father and the baddie from earlier movies, but he'll take White's wife and child instead. After"

Movie No. 25, the long-awaited ""No Time To Die,"" sees MI6's most valuable asset clashing for the first time with culmination, that grand all-roads-have-led-to-this drop of the curtain we've come to expect thanks to Batman, Rey and Tony Stark. There's no pinpointing when over the last 15 years  the longest span of time any actor has beared the license to kill  this run of 007 missions decided it was telling a not-entirely-cohesive interconnected story of cold-blooded angst amid the epic parkour chases and frantic shootouts, but ""No Time To Die"" does its bloated best to pay off the pivot from tradition. Directed to frazzled, ambitious life by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the result is a grand affair befitting the shoddy arc this phase of the Bond franchise fashioned out of its glamour and gunfire. But in its forceful attempts to expand the scope of this run's sincerity as well as its spectacle, Craig's finale doesn't feel like it's coming full circle so much as arriving at inevitable destinations, beckoned there by a bleary-eyed script overanxious to satisfy the widest swath of moviegoers. ""No Time To Die"" arrives six years after ""Spectre,"" a movie of misbegotten construction but peppered with intriguing metatextual wrinkles which time has revealed, and while this may not be the worst of the Craig-era Bond flicks, it is the most redundant. When the smoke of its many explosions subsides, we find a film operating less by its own ethos than the familiar trajectory blockbuster movies have taken since this double-oh tallied his first official kills in 2006. Speaking of explosions, the first doesn't come until about 20 minutes into ""No Time To Die,"" a noticeable and purposeful delay propelling Bond out of yet another sunny retirement with Lea Seydoux's Madeleine Swann, returning an unconvincing romantic dynamic from ""Spectre."" He looks to be at peace, his cold heart defrosted by Italian sunshine and Madeleine's insistence that he visit the local cemetery to heal the wounds he suffered the last time he was swallowed up by love in Venice. There's a nagging, slightly frustrating suspicion that Bond should know better than to trust the solitude. Sure enough, the guardrails go back up as he's yanked into another story of layered revenge and deceit. Where ""No Time To Die"" deviates from formulas both recent and traditional is in its placement of Bond in his own story. The core delight of these movies lies in watching 007 keep up with foes who are constantly one step ahead of him, in entering the shadows not knowing what traps or betrayals lie in wait. In ""No Time To Die,"" the enemies are behind him, and gaining fast (despite a five-year time jump hastened along by Billie Eilish's melancholic anthem). SPECTRE has ostensibly returned, and it's by CIA agent Felix Leiter's hand (Jeffrey"

This latest chapter in cinema's most enduring and beloved espionage series, which also is the swan song for Daniel Craig after five turns as British secret agent James Bond, merely hints at reinventing the character and mythology without fully committing to it. Under the direction of American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation), the Bond films  now 25 and counting  continue to raise the bar in terms of visual extravagance, even if this installment lacks the substance to match the spectacle. Easing into the obligatory elaborate opening set piece  in this case, a harrowing chase involving thugs through narrow streets and stairwells in a quaint Italian village  the film generally dials back the action in favor of enhanced emotional depth and complexity, bolstered by Craig's debonair charm. After the titular Billie Eilish ballad, the film proceeds to check off all the franchise staples, including the catchphrases, music cues, exotic locales, near-death escapes, alluring women, cool cars, high-tech gadgets, and recurring characters. His latest globetrotting saga of international intrigue finds Bond navigating the usual maze of deceit and betrayal, even among his own ranks, with the personal stakes higher than ever. Lured off the beach and out of retirement by an old CIA colleague (Jeffrey Wright) for a low-level investigation, he becomes ensnared in the latest villainy from Spectre. Meanwhile, MI6 has moved on without him, including a dismissive M (Ralph Fiennes), who already has given a young agent named Nomi (Lashana Lynch) his old 007 moniker. Still, it becomes apparent that Bond's expertise is vital as ever, particularly when confronting old nemesis Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) in prison, or tracking down the vengeful Safin (Rami Malek), an expert in bioweaponry whose terrorist plot ties into Bond's ongoing relationship with scientist Madeleine (Lea Seydoux). While piecing together clues, Bond is forced to confront his past and contemplate his future, such as whether the suave yet stubborn agent needs to evolve with the world around him. The convoluted screenplay delivers a sturdy adventure with some suspenseful twists, witty banter, and modest thrills. However, it lacks a memorably fleshed out villain, despite Malek's menacing portrayal. As it builds toward an inevitable final showdown, No Time to Die becomes more content to go through the motions. If we've learned anything in the last six decades, it's that when Bond is on the case, the outcome is never really in doubt. Rated PG-13, 163 minutes."

For the makers of these movies world domination is an ambition fulfilled a long time ago. The trick nowadays is to maintain their iron grip on the hearts and minds of the viewing public. For a franchise that began in 1962, which has now clocked up its 25th entry, the most difficult moments arrive when new actors are introduced to take on the roles of familiar, beloved characters. Some of these characters have been replaced several times over, including the central figure of Secret Agent 007. Sean Connery, the original Bond, who appeared in the role officially on six occasions is still widely regarded as the best. Roger Moore would make seven appearances, and Pierce Brosnan four. Aussie George Lazenby made only one film as James Bond before leaving of his own volition. Timothy Dalton quit after two movies and has hardly been heard of since. With five appearances spread out over 15 years Daniel Craig has played Bond for a longer period than any other actor, imprinting his image on the minds of a generation of viewers  viewers conditioned by social media to have the shortest attention spans in history. So when Craig announces that the new Bond, No Time to Die, will be his last, it sets up a huge buzz of speculation. Will they kill him off? Will they reveal a successor? And for the actor himself, is there life after James Bond? One suspects he'll come through more successfully than Lazenby or Dalton. The knowledge that this will be Craig's last fling exerts an influence on the way the plot unfolds, and the way we view the film. It's not an entirely happy influence because it makes the action seem more than usually mechanical, and allows little scope for other characters to develop convincing personalities. Over an epic span of 163 minutes, director Cary Joji Fukunaga has given us a fast-moving entertainment that won't disappoint the majority of fans, but it's one of the most dramatically uninvolving of Bond movies. The story is all about planet James, with everyone else relegated to the role of satellites. Because this planet is on an inexorable trajectory towards oblivion, every sequence plays out as one more step on the path to the final revelation of Bond's fate  which is easy enough to predict long before the credits roll. This feeling sets in gradually as the film progresses. The pre-titles sequence is spectacular, beginning with a creepy flashback to Madeleine Swan's childhood, as her snow-bound family chalet is invaded by a crazed killer. Next we're with Bond and Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), on holiday in the picturesque Italian town of Matera, where they are waylaid by a group of murderous villains. By the time the reliably amazing titles appear, we're on the edge of our seats. As the story progresses we slide back into the comfy chair. Suddenly it's five"

He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodovar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29). The best comparison I can make of this film is to a piece of clockwork. Precise, exact, nothing is gratuitous or excessive.... What a subtle charm this film works on you as a spectator. The screenplay is one of the best of this genre I have seen in the last few years, very carefully revised and misleading, yet at the end everything makes perfect sense, not the mention on the second time you watch it. It is true that many of the film's features and details may be traced to classic films of the genre, but there is nothing wrong with that. The director himself said it was an homage to directors like Alfred Hitchcock (to whom he has been compared somewhat prematurely.... he may reach such height but he still has a long road to walk). That is one of the great things about the film; it takes the best of the genre, the best that has been made by the best directors... it's a film lover's delight. I had never thought Nicole Kidman could have been at the height of the project, as I really have never considered her a great actress. All I can say is I am still dumbfounded by her extraordinary performance... really, a large percentage of the film's success can be related to her. Sober and discreet when needed, yet grand all the same... It does remind some of the most elegant names of classic Hollywood cinema like the Bette Davis of All about Eve or the Katharine Hepburn of The African queen. But it would be really selfish to give her all the credit when she was supported by an extraordinary cast. Fionnula Flanagan (the sweet old lady from Waking Ned Devine) is trully magnificent as the governess, Mrs. Mills, and very surprising performances of a mute and an old gardener are given by Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes. The children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) are also fantastic. Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamin Fernandez and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people. I do not hesitate to say that this is really one"

Most are concerned with blood and gore, teenage girls getting naked, body count, and not scary. ""The Others"" is atmospheric, spooky, bloodless, and carried by strong acting and fleshed out characters. Yet, it takes too long to make an impact and the final payoff is not as shocking as it should be. The plot is simple and not especially innovative (your average ghost story), but it seems fresh thanks to strong acting and a well-crafted, eerie atmosphere that rivals that of a Tim Burton film. Nicole Kidman is Grace, a beautiful young married mother who must raise her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) alone in their gigantic (actually, ridiculously large) mansion on a British isle, around the end of WWII. They are alone, for the husband and father has been at war and has not returned, and their housekeepers mysteriously vanished. Suddenly, a trio of friendly caretakers arrive one day. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) is the amiable old lady, Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) is a mute young girl, and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) is the not-so-social gardener. However, there is a strange, arcane facet to the trio; they have little background and had no way of knowing that Grace was offering positions at her manor. Aside from this, Grace must deal with her children, who have a deadly allergy to light, which means that the house must be dark all the time, allowing for a spooky dark, shadowy ambience. Anna and Nicholas, most importantly, have been visited - by a family of ghosts. Noises - crying, piano music, and running - have been heard. And curtains that stop light from entering the house are opening and closing by themselves. The film is based around Grace's efforts to solve the enigma. I love the atmosphere of ""The Others,"" set in a nostalgic and ominous 1940's estate. Snowy mist blankets the grass and crisp fall leaves. Murky waters of a lake border the chateau. Elegant furniture, polished marble and wood floors, neatly-woven blankets, tautly fabricated furnishings of wood and olive green cloth, coal black German sedans, lightly wrinkled sweaters and jackets are all seemingly authentic from the era. One spectacular and tense scene has Grace haplessly stumbling through an impenetrably thick ocean of milky fog that weaves through overhanging trees and a ground of crunchy bronze and russet leaves. The action takes a while to get started up, which is a major negative. This is due to the director, Amenabar, spending time to develop an involving plot, 3-D characters, and the aforementioned decor. While Amenabar succeeds in those respects, we find ourselves wishing something would happen. Many people will easily become bored, feel tempted to sleep or leave, etc., but I, while not exactly enthralled by that point in the film, was still enjoying it. When we finally are treated to doses of suspense and chills (not so much horror and terror), it is satisfying. You most likely"
233,XXE_Doc3_The_Others,XXE_Doc3_The_Others,XXE,Horror,Positive,The_Others,"I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because ""scary"" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised. First off, I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense, so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist. Grace (Kidman) and her two young photosensitive (X.P.) children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition, all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants, strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later, she will have to come to terms with what's going on... Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie, and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films, I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn, hard nosed, uptight tart, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two, and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere, partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive, the house must always be dark, and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well, the fog, which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well, and is well placed and executed. Overall, I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects, and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out, and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband,"
234,XXE_Doc4_The_Others,XXE_Doc4_The_Others,XXE,Horror,Positive,The_Others,"To appreciate this film to it's fullest, you need to watch it in the dark by the light of a roaring and flickering fire. Right from the outset, the writer and director, Alejandro Amenabar, sets a chill in your bones. He does this by setting the story in a mansion that is perpetually surrounded by dark grey fog. You can practically feel the frost and dampness in the air as the new servants walk up the path to the front door. Later, this frisson is enhanced by the strange, and possibly paranormal events affecting the family. The Others is a slow burn of a chiller. I like the way Amenabar uses the characters to bring the viewer into the story. You can relate to each in little ways. Though the main character of Grace, Nicole Kidman, is aloof, distant, and cold you know that she loves her children and will do anything to protect them... though there's something not quite right... Mrs Mills, Fionnula Flanagan, is the matriarch of the new servants. She's as strong-willed as Grace and won't take any nonsense from anyone... not even her mistress. At times, this creates conflict giving the audience more to meat to sink their teeth in to. With her chats to the other staff, you begin to realise that they know something, but what? There are more than enough unanswered questions to keep you watching and wondering what is going on in the house? Could it the children? Is it a stranger? Or maybe it's more paranormal? Amenabar takes everything at a slow pace and utilises this to build a creepy ambience and atmosphere. He also has a deft hand at using shadows and light. Too many times, directors go too far and drop a cloak of darkness over everything. Amenabar keeps everything lit. You can see facial expressions, which is great to show and build horror, doubt, fear, anxiety. While in the darkened background, you see a silhouetted humanlike figure pass a window. Eerie as hell. The movie is not a gross-out bloodfest of a horror. It is a haunting and chilling ghost story. So if you don't like this style of horror this flick is not for you. However, if you prefer a story and film to chill your nerves, and run its icy fingers over your soul, then give this well written and filmed movie a watch. Though I did guess the twist in the ending well before the climax when I originally watched this, back in 2002, it has taken me until now to watch it again. I still enjoyed it but not so much. The Others could be the kind of movie you pull off the shelf every twenty years or so. Not because it's awful, but because it's good and memorable. I hadn't forgotten enough to enjoy it more. With that in mind, If you've not watched The Others, I recommend you give it some of your time. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking, and well worth"
235,XXE_Doc5_The_Others,XXE_Doc5_The_Others,XXE,Horror,Positive,The_Others,"Imagine: Someone makes a scary thriller...and it actually has a BRAIN! Well, maybe I'm exaggerating, because some other thrillers do. Take ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Vanilla Sky"" for instance. They had plots, and made you think. But take, say, ""House on Haunted Hill"" (the remake)? Blood. Sex. Gore. Bad special effects. Scares? A real plot? Any reason for making the movie whatsoever besides cheap thrills and money? I think not. ""The Others"" isn't gross at all. The character development is good, and the musical score and sound is outstanding. And Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date. Kidman is Grace, a prim, religious 1940's mother with two photosensitive children, Anne and Nicholas. Every day, instead of school, the children study the Bible by candlelight. (By the way, the setting for the story is great, too. Almost the entire film is shot inside the beautiful but very dark house.) At the beginning, three mysterious servants come to work at the house--even though the advertisement Grace meant to send out never got mailed. This is because, they say, the servants worked in the house before. Soon, Anne begins mentioning Victor, a boy that assumingly keeps talking to her. While at first it looks like a good plan to scare Nicholas, eventually Grace hears noises in the abandoned room upstairs. The old forbidden piano starts playing after the children and servants are asleep, and even though a door isn't supposed to be opened without the previous one being closed first, Grace keeps seeing the door behind her in the corner of her eye open. This might not sound interesting or scary, but you have to see it. The setup for each sudden, frightening moment is about three-quarters of what really scares you, and that's true for most other movies, too. I probably shouldn't go on with the plot, because this is one of the only movies where just one little spoiler ruins the entire movie. ""The Others"" is also probably the only movie that scares you out of your wits every time, not just the first time, and at the same time doesn't give you nightmares for weeks. Probably because none of the scary images are really enough to stick in your head. The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, are excellent young actors, especially James Bentley. He deserves the Young Artist Award he received for this picture, no question about it, and Alakina Mann deserves her nomination. I hate to break it to you fans of gory thrillers, but blood and guts just aren't scary. Sure, they're gross, but they're more hokey than frightening, and it looks as if the filmmakers haven't got anything better to lengthen the movie with, like actual content. Movies like ""The Others"" really deserve praise for using things important to the plot, or at least explaining them at the end. I recommend this to anyone who's in the mood for a good scare without the gore."

With her mother's strict teachings and religious slant, Anne confides in Mrs Mills about her sightings of other people, where Grace would punish her for such stories.

I'm not sure why I never got around to seeing this film in the cinema but somehow it slipped my mind and I was surprised to find it on the television recently as it only seemed that it was out recently. Anyway, needless to say I watched it and at the start was a little put out by plot points which seemed to have been a little bit obviously forced in to provide the director with devices to play with (eg the darkness, the locked doors, the silence etc) but very quickly the film made me forget any reservations I may have had. The plot is a simple ghost story that is told with confidence throughout, with a consistently subtle touch from Amenabar; to me he marked himself out as being worth watching with Abre Los Ojos and this film has only made me sure that he can produce the goods. I didn't think the conclusion was as obvious (although it isn't as shocking as it should be) as others have said and, although it hardly shocked me, it was still satisfying to me  partly because it matched the quiet tone of the film. He plays well with the tools he has written for himself and also includes nice ""fake builds"" with the music and plays with our expectations to good effect. The lack of gore is a good thing and, as Japan continues to show us, sometimes unsettling juxtapositioning images can be even more effective without just sudden gore etc. I was effectively creeped out by the whole thing. Kidman is very well cast and she plays very well indeed  bring the sense of fear to the screen and encouraging the audience to feel the same as her. The child actors avoid being too cute and cloying and are part of making the film rather chilling. Support is very good from Flanagan and Sykes, but you do have to wonder why Eccleston bothered in a role that is pointless for the vast majority"
237,XXE_Doc7_The_Others,XXE_Doc7_The_Others,XXE,Horror,Negative,The_Others,"It seems overly simple to classify ""The Others"" as a cross between classic Hitchcock and ""The Sixth Sense"" . . . mostly, because that implies ""The Others"" is a film of that highest caliber. It's certainly not. However, it's not awful, either; instead ""The Others"" unfortunately falls into the film limbo of being just plain mediocre. ""The Others"" is a suspense/horror film owing a lot to its predecessors from the 1940s -- it relies on mood, atmosphere, and the casts to create the eerie mood that permeates the film, and never falls back on gratuitous gore to create its horrors. The look and feel of ""The Others"" is very much that of a vintage Universal film; in fact, if this film had been made in black & white, and if a digital CGI version of Lana Turner could be inserted in Nicole Kidman's place, you would probably swear that this was a forgotten suspense/horror film from that era. It's definitely not a classic -- there's a number of significant issues that add up together to keep ""The Others"" far, far short of greatness -- but it's an interesting film nonetheless. ""The Others"" is, at its heart, a vintage ghost story -- on a small island off the shores of England, there is a forlorn manor house located far away from the trappings of civilization. Living in this isolated house are the elegant Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. While odd, these rules are vital, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it. The servants, led by the wise Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), accede to these rules . . . but they begin to hears voices. And things going bump in the night. So do Anne and Nicholas. Grace doesn't hear these things, or at least she claims not to, which slowly but surely leads to the questions: Are these new servants creating the disturbances for some sinister purpose? Is troubled Anne creating them? Is Grace? Or does something really lurk within the walls of the manor house, something long-dead, something evil . . . ""The Others"" relies on its pacing and direction to create its ominous mood. This reliance is both the film's strength and ultimate downfall. Director Alejandro Amenabar lets the viewer savor each moment of the film, building suspense from scene to scene at a slow and steady pace, dropping subtle hints about what has happened and what's going to happen with a very deft touch . . . he really lets things build slowly. In fact, too slowly. ""The Sixth Sense"" also moved along at an unhurried pace, but at least that film had the good sense to"

TAKE ONE GODDAMN GUESS! thirdly, the performances... dear god... nicole kidman is TERRIBLE, what is particularly amusing is roger ebert said the following ""nicole kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation"" her character is painted, from the start, as a thinly-veiled psychotic lunatic, i had no empathy for her, and because of that, all the scares that should have worked despite the poor twist fall flat, james bently was a terrible child actor playing a terrible child character, frankly, i wouldn't care if he died a violent horrific death, and that is not a good thing, alakina mann was one of three talented people in the entire movie, she was a decently realized character, and thus, i cared about her, which is why the scene i mentioned earlier worked so effectively, eric sykes and fionulla flanagan were great as the housekeepers, who manage to make otherwise flat dialogue oddly chilling, the story behind the maid was chilling, even if elaine cassidy wasn't really good as the maid. finally, the sorry human being who made this, when you can't get kidman to act properly, and your movie rips off shayamalan and a video game, YOU NEED TO REVISE YOUR F**KING MOVIE!!!"
239,XXE_Doc9_The_Others,XXE_Doc9_The_Others,XXE,Horror,Negative,The_Others,"It must be difficult making a movie like ""The Others,"" when the entire plot is based on one final twist. The filmmakers know what that twist is, and it's probably tough keeping it a secret. Take ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Game,"" or ""Fight Club,"" for instance. The actors know they are playing character's with a special surprise in store for them, but their characters don't. The performances must stay true to the story after the final twist is revealed, but must not foreshadow what is in store for us in the final scenes. ""The Others"" has another one of those endings that makes you want to see the movie again just to see if everything adds up correctly. Unfortunately, most people won't have the patience to sit through it for a second time. The film, directed, composed, and written by Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amendabar, contains a convincing atmosphere and knows how to build tension the audience can cut with a knife, but the timing is off. It makes us wait way too long for something to happen that will relieve the fog-thick suspense. The film takes place on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of World War II, where a young woman awaits the return of her husband who went to war when his country needed him. Nicole Kidman plays this quiet, subtle woman, named Grace, who spends her days and night taking care of her children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) in her gorgeous Victorian mansion. She hires a new trio of house servants to replace the crew who mysteriously disappeared. Then strange things begin to happen. Grace's daughter explains that she has been communicating with an unseen boy. At first, Grace does not believe her child, but when Grace herself starts to hear strange noises, and witness unusual events, she also questions the possibility of an intruder inside her home. ""The Others"" lingers for a long time. It does get under our skin and create a strong, spooky mood, similar to that of the old-fashioned haunted house movies. The film makes us believe we are in a dark, lonely house, and that someone, or something, may be inside with us. Nicole Kidman's performance is contagious. She infects the audience with Grace's fear and suspicion. Easily one of the year's best performances, Kidman stirs the terror with a gripping, uneasy edge. The supporting actors do not steal the scenes from Kidman, she deserves the focus, but they still give her enough material to react to. It's too bad that more doesn't happen in the movie. ""The Others"" eventually becomes redundant-it's scene after scene of Grace walking through dark rooms and closing the blinds to her house-her children are allergic to the light (a plot element that doesn't contribute much to the story). The film also stumbles when a specific character enters the picture-the event is highly anticipated, but the movie doesn't know what to do when it happens. It's worth seeing because of the final revelation,"
240,XXE_Doc10_The_Others,XXE_Doc10_The_Others,XXE,Horror,Negative,The_Others,"Nicole Kidman stars as a single mother of two, left alone in a large mansion as her husband goes off to war. Their home is completely isolated and it is constantly smothered in fog. To make matters worse, their home has no electricity, and her children are deathly allergic to sunlight. In the first five minutes, this movie had all its ducks in a row, to create a chilling thriller. It could have been so good, but writer/director Alejandro Amenabar failed to turn this wonderfully eerie setting into a scary movie. It was like the haunted house that looks creepy and scary from the outside, but has nothing frightening once you get inside. Early on in the movie three strangers approach the house seeking work. Grace(Kidman) welcomes them in to work, commenting that her previous staff had recently disappeared. Immediately we are aware that there is more to these three than we are being told. Grace's daughter Anne has seen people in her house that nobody else can see. Are there ghosts? Or does an simply have an active childish imagination? The remainder of the movie seeks to answer these questions, with Kidman's character seeming to lose more and more of her sanity along the way. There are a few very excellent qualities about this movie, the first being the previously addressed setting. Also there are very strong performances throughout this movie, which is extremely important sice the movie revolves around a very small cast. Firstly, I am not normally a Nicole Kidman fan, and so to say that she was fine, is to say that she did not annoy me. That is quite a compliment in itself. Secondly, her children are wonderful. Particularly Alakina Mann in the role of Kidman's young daughter. There were scenes between her and Kidman that I thought that she completely stole. Finally, Fionnula Flanagan as the elderly maid Mrs. Mills held this movie together. Every time I got bored and disinterested, she would come on the screen and renew my interest. I know that these are not familiar actors, but they were wonderful with what they had. The problem was that they had very little. This movie plods along with nothing really happening. The one other very strong quality this movie offers, is the final ten minutes. These final minutes are wonderful and priceless. I only wish that all of the writing leading up to it had been as interesting. Unfortunately I can not recommend sitting bored for 120 minutes, only to enjoy 10 of them. If that ratio is fine with you, then enjoy those last ten minutes. Ultimately this is a movie with much promise, much potential, but sadly lacking in substance. Thrillers must either create tension, or scares, and there are too few of either one for me to recommend this movie. Wait until it's out on video and then you can fast forward as necessary.

241,YXT_Doc1_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT_Doc1_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT,Comedy,Positive,Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,"In ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"" the inventive, free-floating ode to nerdville, the comic-book geek stays in the picture. Whether it's Scott's everyday loser life or his ninja-fighting, super-powered imaginary one, it's all played with a sort of Michael Cera-styled sweet, nebbishy sensibility that works well since the real Michael Cera actually got the role. Go figure. Actually, there was a lot of figuring to be done to convert Bryan Lee O'Malley's distinctive artistic, and loosely autobiographical, musings about a 22-year-old Toronto native whose life is framed by his total lack of ambition until he's in a fight to the death to woo the girl of his dreams. Whew. Which is why Edgar Wright of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" with all its slacker-zombie nonsense, seemed like such a good choice to direct. He was. Scott's life is loosely envisioned as a video game, with Cera channeling his Cera-ness perfectly, which is tougher than it looks. Be prepared for a lot of free-associating inside this fantastical world where the ordinary rules of gravity, coolness and linear storytelling do not necessarily apply. There are various gaming and social networking conceits  among them snarky comments on screen to help the older-or-other-generationals among you keep things straight, and provide those in the know with a laugh. Example: As each character enters the picture, they get a Facebook-style voice-over intro  name, age, relationship status  accompanied by pop-up captions with the same details scrawled out, repetition that will either annoy you or amuse you. But it's not a bad idea since the filmmakers pile on a lot of details in a very short time. Meanwhile that dream girl's name is Ramona ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and she has seven deadly exes, as opposed to seven deadly sins, which is more the norm for chicks in fanboy films. Scott must fight each ""to the death,"" with a death earning high scores and a rainstorm of coins, while kisses (with the girl, not the exes) burst into fireworks of floating hearts. You kind of have to be there. That is the genius and difficulty of ""Scott Pilgrim""; it both defies and, at its lower moments, meets expectations for this sort of film. The screenplay, written by the director and Michael Bacall (""Manic""), remains true to O'Malley's six-volume Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series. Director of photography Bill Pope, who's no stranger to the conversion of graphic concepts to the big screen, having done ""Darkman"" and the last two ""Spider-Mans,"" among others, keeps Scott's world on the ethereal, hyper-realized side whether or not he's in superhero mode. Absurdity is in every corner as Scott finds himself in one pickle after another; it's a mix of sweet and sour bites, but bracing regardless. All the action swirls around Scott's love life, which by all accounts he shouldn't even have. Nevertheless, being true to the dreams of the awkward everywhere, Scott has managed to land one hot chick after another. His latest flicker (flame would just be overstating the"
242,YXT_Doc2_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT_Doc2_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT,Comedy,Positive,Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,"Edgar Wright takes the ache out of ""achingly cool"" with his entertaining, hyperactive gamer-geek comedy Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, set in freezing cold Toronto and based on the graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Despite riffing on some apparently emotional themes  male romantic status-anxiety is brought interestingly into parallel with Canada's cultural cringe to the United States  Wright insists on nothing more than comedy and the spectacle of pastiche, an entertainment of Seinfeldian inconsequence. The movie has been attacked in some quarters for lack of heart, and for an alleged lack of box office nous in pitching to a demographic that favours illegal downloads over ticket-buying. I can only say that where some see shallowness, I saw a witty interplay of surfaces and style. Our hero is Scott Pilgrim, bassist in the crashingly loud local band Sex Bob-omb and keen player of video games, activities that encompass the sum total of his cultural life. An interest in literature surfaces briefly when he realises that the love of his life has a job making special deliveries for Amazon, and so orders a book  the title of which is irrelevant and unmentioned. Scott is played by Michael Cera, perhaps the most sexually unthreatening male in the history of cinema, with a gentle, moonish face that makes him look like an early-60s Beatle. Scott and his band are not slackers, exactly: Wright shows them industriously rehearsing and worrying about their romantic and musical careers, but they are so utterly unworried about earning a living that they could as well be in college or even high school. Scott has a love life that, though notionally filled with angst, is actually beyond the wildest dreams of most real-life saddos and geeks. He has been dumped by impossibly glamorous blonde singer Envy Adams (Brie Larson), but now into a platonic rebound relationship with teenage schoolgirl Knives Chau, played by 25-year-old Ellen Wong, to the tetchy disapproval of his sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). But then he falls for unattainably cool Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who has just moved to Canada from New York  the number she gives him still has the 212 area code. Their forbidden love begins to blossom, but Scott is confronted with a terrible quest: he must do battle with Ramona's seven evil exes, led by Gideon (Jason Schwartzman), the oleaginous New York record boss who holds the destiny of Sex Bob-omb in his hands and is given to snide solecisms such as ""Between you and I"". The titanic battles between Scott and each vengeful ex are, of course, entirely stylised, sorcery-fantasy contests whose choreography can exist only on a gamer's computer screen: they are different, in their way, from the martial arts confrontations in, say, Tarantino's Kill Bill or Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass, because they are so unreal and unserious, and always liable to be interrupted and undermined with throwaway gags. Each face-off exists only to facilitate comedy and a continuous fizz of generic pastiche, and even"

Pretty impressive both as an adaptation and as an exercise in cinematic style, it's a feat that probably only director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) could have pulled off. I like the movie's narrative energy and creative cross-pollination of image media culture. I might be twice the age of the target audience, but a movie that brings something new is of as much interest for a fortysomething film critic as a twentysomething gamer. After all, we critics get tired of movies being just like all the other movies we've seen. Where Dastan in Prince of Persia was just a glorified avatar, Scott is effectively a game player  which is to say, he's an actual person. Unfortunately, he's a an actual person buried in a world of artificiality into which precious little humanity intrudes  which is to say, the world of gaming. The problem starts with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a jaded, rollerblading goth chick from New York who initially seems way too cool for Scott. She's the girl of Scott's dreams  why? Just because he actually dreamed about her? Then the story floats a sci-fi explanation about Ramona passing through Scott's head; he might as well have spotted her on the street. That's not the girl of your dreams. Ramona's attitude toward Scott is equally artificial. After initially coming off almost too cool to talk to him, on their first date she snuggles up to him in her skivvies and takes him to bed, though at the last minute she decides not to go all the way (unless she changes her mind). This isn't real behavior of a human love interest, even if she's damaged goods; it's just playing with the hero's emotions, as well as those of male audience members. Why exactly is Ramona into Scott? For that matter, why does Scott seem to have such success with women out of his league? Besides Ramona, there's 17-year-old Knives Chau (Emily Wong), who may be in high school but is super cute and totally into Scott; Envy Adams (okay, she hurt him in the end, but she's a gorgeous rock star who's still into him, still jealous of his current girl); Kim, drummer for Scott's band, the Sex Bob-ombs (Kim Pine), whom Scott dumped ... and at least one more, right? I forget. The idea that Scott has to defeat each of the seven members of the ""League of Evil Exes"" in order to date Ramona has an obvious gaming vibe; Wright himself acknowledges that Scott views Ramona as ""a shiny object in a game,"" but does the movie offer any other perspective on her? It's possible"

I tried to love it. But after 20 minutes, I sensed I was intruding on the movie's love affair with itself. Michael Cera presides as a bass-playing 22-year-old hoping to dump one girlfriend (her name is Knives) and get with another (Ramona) while fighting off the latter's evil exes in a series of battles. Each time, the characters turn into live-action video-game figures and the screen fills with colorful captions. Fwomp! Ker-Pow! And ka-thunk. The (many) video-game spoofs are all essentially the same, really long, joke. As they get jumbled in with the pop-up boxes providing factoids on the setting, the scribbled words ""DING-DONG"" floating out of doorbells, and an animated black box that keeps popping in over a girl's mouth every time she curses, the aesthetic is . . . hectic. I go to the movies to escape this prevailing brain-scramble of our time. Director Edgar Wright (""Hot Fuzz"") will have only himself to blame if excited kids are so razzled and dazzled that they power on their pocket gadgets and start Prattering or Twixting, or whatever it is youth does these days. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is made to be viewed on such a gizmo, one equipped with a fast-forward function. Daffy, endearing touches and quotable lines bounce and poing. Cera's grandmaster-level deadpan  picked up by a cast that includes Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans (who is funny, for once, as a vain movie star), Kieran Culkin, Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick  brings out the funny in an irony-encrusted script based on a series of graphic novels. ""Do you know Pac-Man?"" ""I know of him."" A lady who no longer loves ladies is a ""has-bian."" A battle cry runs, ""Die! Obviously!"" And this must be the first movie to turn AOL and ""Seinfeld"" into punch lines indicating the presence of rusty retro. But this ninja rodeo, this chaos prom, this pulsing grenade of irony can't sustain itself. Burn hard, burn out. Even if it had run half an hour shorter, it would have been an hour too long. There can be laughs in anti-comedy and random weirdness (""He punched a hole in the moon for me. It was pretty crazy,"" ""No vegan diet, no vegan powers!""). But hip can be a strain. (I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to laugh because one character is randomly named Stephen Stills. Have 22-year-olds even heard of that folky geezer?) And it takes close to 40 minutes for the plot, such as it is, to kick in. Even then, the movie just skitters this way and that, taking its time to set up the big decision about which girl Scott will choose  Knives or Ramona. But they're both cool. Scott's cool. Everything's cool. So nothing matters."
245,YXT_Doc5_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT_Doc5_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT,Comedy,Negative,Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,"The titular world of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a small one, dominated by an unhealthy mix of video games, emo rock, and a juvenile approach to personal relationships. Our protagonist, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), is essentially stuck in a never-ending cycle of arrested development, particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. His romantic quest for Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) quickly devolves into a series of literal video-game-style ""level-ups,"" which only inch him closer to a largely superficial goal. Ramona, the archetypal ""cool girl"" with a complicated past, is reduced to an object for Scott to win by defeating her seven evil exesa group that feels more like a parade of cartoonish supervillains than real characters. The movie's conceit of turning the ups and downs of relationships into a live-action arcade game is both clever and shallow. While the film's superficiality is one of its core flaws, it's frustratingly intertwined with a visually captivating presentation. Directed by Edgar Wright, known for his cult hits like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, the film pulls out all the stops in terms of aesthetic appeal. Every frame is packed with flashy visuals, from shifting aspect ratios to bold color schemes that pop off the screen. Wright treats the movie like a live-action comic book, with sound effects rendered in cartoonish text and exaggerated physical gags. In this sense, the film is undeniably inventive and meticulously crafted. Fans of visual spectacle and kinetic filmmaking will find themselves drawn in by the sheer creativity on display. However, the film's visual splendor serves a hollow core. For all its dazzling aesthetics, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World lacks emotional depth and fails to deliver meaningful character growth. Scott himself is more of a walking punchline than a fully realized character. The film's reliance on Michael Cera's signature awkward charm does little to elevate the role. Cera, who by this point had perfected the art of playing the adorably clueless underdog, delivers a performance that feels phoned in, as if he's playing a caricature of his previous roles. His portrayal lacks the emotional range required to make Scott's journey resonate with the audience on a deeper level. In contrast, Cera's work in Youth in Revolt managed to imbue a similar character with more nuance, making his shortcomings here all the more apparent. Ramona, played by Winstead, isn't given much to work with either. While she's positioned as the object of Scott's affections, her personality is largely defined by her constantly changing hair colora superficial trait that epitomizes how the film treats its female characters. She exists mainly as a prize for Scott to pursue, rather than a fully formed character with her own agency. This leaves her feeling like little more than a two-dimensional placeholder for the ""cool girl"" archetype, despite Winstead's best efforts to inject some life into the role. The supporting cast fares better in terms of bringing energy and charm to their roles, particularly Jason Schwartzman as Gideon, the"

It's not that I don't care, as I can talk about movies for hours if given the opportunity. When it comes to actually sitting down and writing about them however, the words usually just aren't there. Then I watched Scott Pilgrim vs The World. People who know me would probably think I'd love this movie. And if you were talking to my 18-year-old self, they'd probably be right. It's chock full of gaming references, campy action sequences, girls with blue hair, lots of stuff that the old me would have probably eaten up. That Richard is gone now though. Well, except for the blue hair thing. That's hot. I expect some depth from my stories now, something on screen to stir an emotional reaction in me. Scott Pilgrim has none of that, even though it's supposedly composed of things that I love. Instead I saw wholly unlikable characters and a thin, unbelievable romance designed to rope people like 18-year-old Richard into thinking it's good. Scott Scott is the single biggest problem with the whole movie. Not only is Scott an unlikable douche throughout almost the whole film, Michael Cera's performance exemplifies his bad traits to the point where they're excruciating to watch. I don't hate Cera as much as some people I know, as his jittery teenager character works in a lot of instances (Arrested Development, Superbad, etc.), but here he's disastrously cast as a hero. Making a character flawed or less than moral is fine-in fact it's great. But there's a big difference between being a lovable buffoon and a desperate jackass. Scott begins the movie dating a high school girl named Knives (who I'll talk about in more detail later) for the sole reason of getting over is previous girlfriend. Knives really cares about Scott, but it's clear that Scott is only using her as a trophy. So we establish at the very beginning that Scott is an insecure jerk, something that never truly changes. Contrast this with a character like Jack Sparrow. Sure he's kind of an ass himself, and he's motivated by selfishness more often than not. He has actual redeeming qualities though. He's funny, and despite being a thieving pirate he's still likable because his gregariousness overshadows everything else. Scott has none of these things. Instead of being what most teenage/early 20s guys want to be, he's what they are. The loser persona is never really alleviated, even after the final battle. He's still an annoying whelp even after he supposedly saves the day, and Cera's presence only makes it worse. I need to be able to relate to Scott, but almost everything he does is so cowardly and reprehensible that it's just impossible. He utterly fails as a main character. Ramona Ramona is the girl of Scott's dreams. Or so we're told. It's hard for me to tell since she spends most of the movie looking completely disinterested in everything"
247,YXT_Doc7_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT_Doc7_Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,YXT,Comedy,Positive,Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World,"To say that the comic-to-film adaptation Scott Pilgrim Vs The World has been well marketed would be a modest statement. Thanks to all the trailers, sneak peeks, cheeky cast reveals and secret screenings, not to mention the tweets, tie-in videogame and perfectly-timed release of the series' final volume, the anticipation level among its target audience is off the chart. And it's no surprise, since it's effectively the Twilight or Harry Potter for hip geeks and geeky hipsters. But where the big screen adaptations of the boy-wizard and girl-who-dates-supernatural-hunks franchises have the luxury of sequel-ready storytelling, Scott Pilgrim takes its six-volume arc and crams it into just under two hours. However, director Edgar Wright is perfect for the job. After all, this tale of twenty-something Torontonians fits right in with the work he has made in the past with collaborator Simon Pegg. For Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) isn't a million miles away from a Spaced character. He's bumbling through life, using cultural touchstones (games and music, mostly) to shape and define his world. However, whereas the line between reality and fantasy was flexed in Spaced, here, it is broken, as the protagonist starts to date the literal girl of his dreams, a hyper-cool, roller-skating courier called Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). There's just one caveat: Scott has to fight her seven evil exes in spectacular combat before winning her heart. Appropriately for a film that uses music and sound effects from The Legend Of Zelda both diegetically and re-arranged in the score, these showdowns are of full-blown videogame-like proportions. They're end level bosses, with each providing their own distinct settings and styles. Take ex number one, Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), who launches mid-battle into his special move, a Bollywood dance sequence. Likewise, a later confrontation sees Scott's band, Sex Bob-Omb, facing the Katayanagi twins in an amp versus amp musical assault.Their tunes wash over the crowd, and morph into CGI monsters in the air, recalling in their lucency the primitive spooks from Ghostbusters. It is one thing to pack the film full of nods and references (and there are so many, we lost count), but Wright and his creative team are endlessly inventive and refreshingly experimental. The fight sequences are well staged, acrobatic and shot without a hint of shaky cam. Editing is breathless, and aspect ratios are tinkered with throughout. Even non-action moments are given stylistic flair, as comic-book captions are used to push along montage sequences, or bridge a jump-cut between scenes. The results are always stimulating, as Wright pushes at the boundaries of modern filmmaking, revealing that what he could do with minimal budget was just a taster for when his imagination is writ large. All this trickery would be nothing if not for the simple story at the film's heart. Indeed, it could at times seem too stylised, and its layers of pastiche and parody may alienate some and confuse others. But its central romance is mature, genuine, and quite touching. For all the bluster and knockout"

It's not that comic books don't translate well to movies, it's that this particular comic book is so steeped in its own lore and in-jokes that a two-hour film adaptation leaves little room for you to do anything but marvel at a blitzkrieg of slick editing and frenetic action. Michael Cera doesn't disappoint as the titular bass-slinging, perpetually unemployed twenty something rocker; the latest incarnation of his furrowed-brow, Mona Lisa smile schtick is so practiced it's damn near Stanislavskian. He falls for the uber-deadpan hipster Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and soon has to confront a posse of her seven evil exes to win her heart, all according to some never fully explained variant on the damsel in distress. The pair have next to no chemistry, romantic or otherwise, so most of the performance slack falls on some truly inspired bit parts. Kieran Culkin is fantastic as Scott's sardonic lothario roommate, and Chris Evans' bro-tastic, skateboard-toting evil ex is pitch-perfect. There are plenty of visual distractions from the ho-hum characters: the film crackles with ultra-bright CGI, primary-color flourishes and sound effects rendered literally (""Thonk!"" ""Pow!"") exploding on every square inch of the screen. It makes for bleeding-edge visual filmmakingWright has a keen eye for translating hyperkinetic Street Fighter brawls into a breakneck, blink-and-you'll miss yarn. But Scott Pilgrim's failings have more to do with heart than craft. The film's plot and character development play out quite literally like a Final Fantasy dungeon crawlright down to the itemized level-ups, boss fights, and ultra-taut pacinga high-tension sugar rush that never lets down. It's impossible to care about any the characters when the circumference of their personalities is a jumbled mess of pop-culture references; doubly so when the next larger-than-life clash is, inevitably, only 10 minutes away. With a different pairing of lead actors, Scott Pilgrim could have been stellar. The film is, at heart, about dealing with the baggage that every couple brings to a relationshipbut the romance in question doesn't even try be endearing or relatable. Rather, every line is delivered one step ahead of the audience, with too-caustic wit and an ain't-I-a-stinker smirk. Like the special effects, the characters are sketched out in tiresome cinematic shorthand, as if to reassure the viewer that this joyride really isn't worth thinking too hard about. Which is fine, but it turns what could have been a cinematic feat into a popcorn flick."

Wright takes a unique medium, namely the videogame world, and perfectly translates it to cinema, constructing what will be the example for future videogame-to-film adaptations, in that, with the right approach, the much-maligned genre can work. How ironic that the film's source isn't even a videogame; and yet, the film plays by videogame rules, but at the same time splices a romantic comedy with a typical videogame-level structure. While the story is clever and often hilarious, the way Wright brings together his unbelievable productionfrom the story to his meticulously composed and layered presentationis what makes the film so exciting and even important. The impeccably stylized approach by Wright and his editors Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss alone demands attention. They create zooming transitions and fight scenes arranged at a breakneck pace, which our bodies follow as if the film itself were literally transporting us from location to location within the story. Visual cues appear onscreen, such as a yellow 16-bit ""pee meter"" that goes down as one character urinates. When the protagonist, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), awakens one morning and steps from a dark room into a bright bathroom, white light beams and he screams ""Ahhhhh!""the letters appearing around him like a comic book. Indeed, the universe of Wright's film is not reality, but a place ruled by the logic of video games and comic books, and indie rock music. And your understanding of those worlds is crucial to your enjoyment of the film. When the film opens, Scott Pilgrim seems like a normal young guy in his early twenties. He's still brokenhearted over an ex-girlfriend that dumped him long ago, so he's dating a sympathetic 17-year-old Chinese high school girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) to make himself feel better. They don't kiss or touch, they barely even hold hands. Scott just wants the company of the cute girl to boost him, until he dreams about Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) roller-skating through his head, and then sees her the next day in the flesh, Brazil style. She must be 'the one' and he must pursue her. When he does, he discovers that in order to date her, Scott is obligated to defeat Romona's Seven Evil Exes, and they appear for elaborate battles inspired by fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Tekken. But there's more substance and emotional maturity to the plot than mere fights to win the girl. Scott's battles become about earning self-respect, so his liaison with Romona may move beyond puppy-love infatuation and burgeon into a full-fledged relationship. The fights themselves are truly remarkable displays of Wright's talent, ones that are easier to understand if you're familiar with videogame culture, but remain clear regardless of your experience. In other words, anyone can grasp the gist of the film, but how much depends on"

Culling from everything lauded for its pop culture ""coolness,"" ""Pilgrim"" mixes comic books, martial arts, slow motion, special effects, rock music, cursing, overt sexuality, swordfights, and more to create a world much like a video game, complete with extra lives, power-ups, and points awarded for victories. Surprisingly, the sum of its parts doesn't equal an awesomeness equivalent to the levels of entertainment each component would normally produce, likely due to a general incompatibility in the content, yet the creativity and cleverness of the parable still leaves one better for the experience. Relationships are rarely simple, and this film proves with stylistic relish that anything worth having must be fought to the death for with whips and hammers. Having had his heart broken a year ago, 22-year-old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) begins dating high-schooler Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), much to the dismay of his sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick) and his roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin). Her patronage to Pilgrim's rock band ""Sex Bob-omb"" gains her acceptance by overly anxious singer/guitarist Stephen (Mark Webber), pessimistic drummer Kim (Alison Pill), and enthusiastic back-up bassist Young Neil (Johnny Simmons). When Scott encounters the literal ""girl of his dreams,"" mysterious Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), his instant attraction to the illusive girl finds him rejecting Chau to begin dating his newfound obsession. But Scott soon discovers the complexities of love, and the perilous nature of his newest romance, when he learns that he must first defeat Ramona's seven evil exes if he wishes to continue courting the neon-headed beauty. Is the editing in a movie enough to impress audiences? ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" proves that in rare instances, it is. This film features so many visual gimmicks that even though the plot sounds repetitive, the random, outlandish special effects keep things fresh. With video game sound effects, corporeal words forming like clouds above characters, split screens, pop-up information cards (like VH1's ""Pop-Up Videos""), bizarre scene transitions, animation, cartoonish anime fighting, a ""Seinfeld"" laugh-track, enemies pixellating and dropping coins when defeated, and much, much more, repetition is never an issue. In fact, the editing is so uniquely clever that it garners the majority of the laughs  the humorous extra effects dancing on the screen are oftentimes funnier than the dialogue. So much of ""Pilgrim"" is completely nonsensical, bringing new meaning to the notion of a live action video game movie. It never bothers to explain the boundaries or restrictions in this world where characters break out into song and dance just to provide a never-ending soundtrack, superpowers are earned and lost based on vegan eating habits, and gravity jumps in and out of existence. Just like a video game, where the player doesn't need to know martial arts to control their character in the ways of master fighters, this"
251,ZEO_Doc1_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc1_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Positive,Top_Gun,"Top Gun delivers on all fronts when it comes to action and excitement, making it one of the most iconic films of the 1980s. Directed by Tony Scott, this movie takes us deep into the world of naval aviation with Tom Cruise at the helm as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. From the very first moments, it's clear that Top Gun is not just about flying jetsit's about the intense personalities that pilot them and the relationships that form under pressure. One of the film's greatest strengths is how it balances the action with its characters' development. Maverick is far from just an adrenaline junkie; his character goes through significant growth. At the start, he's cocky, impulsive, and often disregards the rules, which puts him at odds with his fellow pilots. But as the story unfolds, we see a more vulnerable side to him, especially in his relationship with Goose, his best friend and radar intercept officer. Goose provides the emotional center of the film, and their friendship adds depth to what could have been a straightforward action flick. When tragedy strikes, Maverick is forced to confront the consequences of his recklessness in a way that completely shifts the tone of the movie. Visually, Top Gun stands out even decades after its release. The aerial combat sequences are stunning, capturing the intensity and speed of fighter jet maneuvers with remarkable clarity. Scott's decision to use real jets and practical effects gives the film a level of authenticity that's still impressive today. You can almost feel the G-forces as the planes twist and turn through the skies. These scenes aren't just there for spectaclethey're integral to the story and Maverick's journey, each one pushing him closer to realizing his full potential. And of course, the soundtrack is unforgettable. Songs like ""Danger Zone"" by Kenny Loggins and ""Take My Breath Away"" by Berlin have become synonymous with Top Gun. The music perfectly complements the film's energy and emotional beats, heightening both the tension in the air and the more intimate moments between Maverick and Charlie, his love interest played by Kelly McGillis. Their relationship provides a softer contrast to the high-stakes world of fighter jets, though it never detracts from the film's main focus: Maverick's personal and professional evolution. What keeps Top Gun relevant isn't just its thrilling dogfights or catchy music, but its portrayal of growth and redemption. Maverick's arc is relatablehe makes mistakes, deals with loss, and learns to take responsibility, becoming a better pilot and person by the film's end. The rivalry between Maverick and Iceman (Val Kilmer) is another highlight, evolving from intense competition to mutual respect, adding complexity to both characters. Ultimately, Top Gun isn't just an action movie. It's a film about friendship, loss, and finding one's way in a highly competitive, dangerous environment. With its stellar performances, particularly from Cruise, and its flawless execution of aerial combat scenes, Top Gun is a movie that still resonates, blending adrenaline with heart in a way few films have managed"
252,ZEO_Doc2_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc2_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Positive,Top_Gun,"Few movies capture the spirit of the 1980s quite like Top Gun. Directed by Tony Scott and starring Tom Cruise as the bold and often reckless pilot Maverick, the film has everything you'd expect from a blockbuster: high-flying action, a killer soundtrack, and characters that stick with you long after the credits roll. What makes Top Gun so memorable, though, is how it pairs thrilling aerial sequences with a story about personal growth and camaraderie. From the moment we meet Maverick, it's clear that he's not like the other pilots at the Top Gun Naval Flying School. He's talented, sure, but his attitude is what sets him apartand not always in a good way. Throughout the film, we watch as he navigates the challenges of his profession, both in the air and on the ground. His friendship with Goose is the heart of the movie, grounding Maverick's more extreme tendencies. Goose adds humor and warmth to the film, making his eventual death all the more impactful. It's a turning point for Maverick, forcing him to confront his own mortality and rethink the way he approaches both flying and life. What Top Gun does exceptionally well is convey the intensity of aerial combat. The flying scenes are shot with real F-14 fighter jets, and you can feel the tension as the pilots push their planes to the limit. The cinematography captures the action in a way that makes you feel like you're right there in the cockpit. It's easy to see why these sequences are still considered some of the best in action film history. The danger feels real, and every maneuver matters. The rivalry between Maverick and Iceman (Val Kilmer) is another key element of the story. Iceman is everything Maverick isn'tcalm, disciplined, and by-the-book. Their tension is palpable from the start, and it's clear that they push each other to be better. By the end of the movie, their relationship has evolved from outright hostility to respect, a journey that feels earned. Music plays a huge role in Top Gun, too. The soundtrack is just as iconic as the film itself. Songs like ""Danger Zone"" and ""Take My Breath Away"" aren't just background noisethey're woven into the very fabric of the movie. The music adds a sense of energy and drama to the already high-stakes scenes, enhancing the film's emotional beats. While the film is packed with action, it's the quieter moments that give it heart. Maverick's relationship with Charlie adds depth to his character, showing that he's more than just a cocky pilot. Their romance isn't the focal point of the film, but it serves as a nice counterbalance to the high-octane flying scenes. Top Gun endures not just because of its adrenaline-pumping action but because it gives audiences characters they can care about. Maverick's journey is one of redemption, and by the time the credits roll, he's proven that he's more than just a hotshot pilothe's a leader, a friend, and someone who's learned to embrace responsibility."

Released in 1986, this Tony Scott-directed classic still holds up today as one of the best action films ever made. Tom Cruise stars as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a daring young pilot with a chip on his shoulder and something to prove. The movie takes you on a high-flying journey as Maverick navigates his way through the prestigious Top Gun Naval Flying School, where only the best of the best get to train. What makes Top Gun such a standout is its ability to weave thrilling aerial combat sequences into a story that's ultimately about personal growth. Maverick is not just flying against other pilots; he's also trying to outrun the shadow of his father, a decorated pilot who died under mysterious circumstances. This gives the character a bit more depth than you might expect in an 80s action movie. Cruise plays the role with his trademark intensity, making Maverick both likable and frustrating at times. His chemistry with his co-pilot and best friend, Goose, played by Anthony Edwards, is a huge part of what makes this movie work. Goose acts as a stabilizing force for Maverick, and their camaraderie is heartfelt and believable. The aerial combat scenes are where Top Gun truly shines. Scott's direction, combined with real F-14 fighter jets, creates some of the most thrilling dogfights ever filmed. The realism of these scenes is incredible, and it feels like you're right there in the cockpit with the pilots. The tension is palpable, and the stakes feel real, especially during the final climactic battle. The cinematography captures the speed and danger of each maneuver, making these sequences not only exciting but also nerve-wracking. Of course, it wouldn't be Top Gun without its unforgettable soundtrack. ""Danger Zone"" by Kenny Loggins has become synonymous with the film, and it perfectly sets the tone for the high-stakes world of fighter pilots. ""Take My Breath Away"" by Berlin adds a romantic flair, enhancing the scenes between Maverick and Charlie (Kelly McGillis), his love interest. While the romance may feel a bit secondary to the main plot, it still provides a nice counterbalance to all the testosterone-fueled action. Val Kilmer's Iceman is another highlight of the film. His rivalry with Maverick adds an extra layer of tension, and the two characters push each other to be better pilots. By the end, their relationship evolves from antagonism to mutual respect, which feels earned and satisfying. In the end, Top Gun is more than just an action movieit's a story about friendship, competition, and personal growth. It's one of those rare films that strikes the perfect balance between adrenaline and emotion. Even after all these years, it remains a must-watch for anyone who loves action-packed movies with heart."
254,ZEO_Doc4_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc4_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Positive,Top_Gun,"Top Gun is the kind of movie that leaves a lasting impression, and it's not just because of its high-octane action scenes. Directed by Tony Scott, the film has a unique blend of breathtaking aerial combat, unforgettable characters, and a soundtrack that's become iconic in its own right. Tom Cruise delivers a star-making turn as Maverick, the young and ambitious fighter pilot who is determined to be the best at the elite Top Gun school. From the moment the movie starts, you're drawn into Maverick's worlda world filled with competition, danger, and the pursuit of excellence. What makes Top Gun so effective is the way it balances action with character development. Yes, the dogfights are incredible, but they wouldn't mean as much if we didn't care about the people flying the planes. Maverick is a flawed character; he's cocky, impulsive, and often makes reckless decisions. But as the movie progresses, you see him evolve, especially after the death of his best friend, Goose. The loss of Goose is a turning point for Maverick, forcing him to confront his own mortality and rethink his priorities. Cruise's portrayal of Maverick's grief and guilt is surprisingly nuanced, adding an emotional weight to the film that elevates it beyond a typical action flick. The film's aerial sequences are, of course, legendary. Using real Navy jets, Scott captures the sheer power and speed of fighter planes in a way that few films have been able to replicate. The dogfights are fast-paced and intense, keeping you on the edge of your seat. What's remarkable is how these scenes are not just about showing off cool stunts; they're also integral to Maverick's personal journey. Each dogfight serves as a test for Maverick, not just of his skill but of his character. The supporting cast is also stellar. Val Kilmer's Iceman is the perfect foil to Maverick. Where Maverick is wild and unpredictable, Iceman is disciplined and by-the-book. Their rivalry is one of the best parts of the movie, and by the end, when they've earned each other's respect, it feels completely satisfying. Kelly McGillis as Charlie adds a romantic subplot that, while not the focus of the movie, provides a nice counterbalance to all the action. And then there's the music. The Top Gun soundtrack is iconic for a reason. ""Danger Zone"" sets the tone for the high-flying action, while ""Take My Breath Away"" adds a layer of romance to Maverick's relationship with Charlie. The music enhances the emotional beats of the film, making those key moments even more impactful. All in all, Top Gun is a perfect blend of action, emotion, and style. It's a film that has stood the test of time and continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're watching it for the first time or revisiting it after many years, Top Gun never fails to entertain."

Directed by Tony Scott, the film skyrocketed Tom Cruise to superstardom and cemented his place as an iconic action hero. What makes Top Gun so engaging, even decades after its release, is the seamless combination of adrenaline-pumping aerial combat, memorable characters, and a soundtrack that captures the spirit of the 1980s. At the heart of Top Gun is the story of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, a young, talented fighter pilot with a lot to prove. Cruise's performance as Maverick is magnetic. He plays the role with a mix of swagger, vulnerability, and charm, making Maverick a character you want to root for despite his flaws. Maverick is reckless, daring, and often arrogant, but as the film progresses, we see him grow into a more thoughtful and mature pilot. His journey isn't just about mastering the skiesit's about mastering himself. One of the things Top Gun does best is making the audience care about the characters, especially the relationship between Maverick and his best friend, Goose. Played by Anthony Edwards, Goose is the heart of the film, providing much-needed levity and warmth. The chemistry between Cruise and Edwards is natural and adds an emotional layer to the movie. When Goose tragically dies in a training accident, the film takes a darker, more introspective turn. Maverick's grief and guilt become central to the story, and his arc of redemption becomes even more compelling. The loss of Goose is one of the film's most powerful moments and serves as a turning point for Maverick's character. In terms of action, Top Gun is a visual feast. The aerial combat sequences are stunning, and the fact that real F-14 jets were used gives the film an authenticity that few action movies can match. The dogfights are thrilling, shot with a sense of speed and intensity that puts the audience right in the middle of the action. Tony Scott's direction is masterful in these scenes, using tight shots and fast editing to create tension and excitement. The aerial stunts feel dangerous and exhilarating, making you appreciate the skill and bravery of the pilots. Val Kilmer's Iceman provides a perfect foil to Maverick. While Maverick is impulsive and emotional, Iceman is calm, disciplined, and controlled. Their rivalry drives much of the tension in the film, but it's more than just a competition. By the end of the movie, Maverick earns Iceman's respect, and their final handshake is one of the most satisfying moments in the film. It's a classic story of rivals becoming allies, and it works beautifully here. No review of Top Gun would be complete without mentioning the iconic soundtrack.

256,ZEO_Doc6_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc6_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Negative,Top_Gun,"While Top Gun is often hailed as an action classic, it falls short when viewed through a modern lens. Directed by Tony Scott and starring Tom Cruise as the cocky fighter pilot Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the film offers plenty of high-octane aerial combat but little in the way of meaningful character development or narrative depth. For all its flash and flair, Top Gun feels more like an overblown recruitment ad for the U.S. Navy than a well-rounded movie. One of the biggest issues with Top Gun is the lack of a cohesive plot. The story centers around Maverick's time at the elite Top Gun Naval Flying School, where he competes with other pilots to be the best. But beyond this basic premise, the movie doesn't offer much in terms of a compelling narrative. The stakes feel surprisingly low for a film about fighter pilots, and the script seems more concerned with showcasing Maverick's bravado than exploring the complexities of his character. His arcfrom reckless hotshot to slightly more disciplined pilotisn't particularly well-developed, and by the end of the movie, it's hard to feel that he's truly learned or changed much. Then there's the romance subplot between Maverick and his flight instructor, Charlie, played by Kelly McGillis. Their relationship feels forced and lacks genuine chemistry. The scenes between them are awkward and poorly written, with dialogue that sounds more like a string of cliches than actual conversation. The love story seems like it was tacked on as an afterthought, more to cater to audience expectations than to add anything meaningful to the plot. Charlie's role in the film is largely underutilized, and she's reduced to a love interest rather than being a strong, independent character. While the aerial combat scenes are undeniably impressive, they can't carry the movie on their own. The dogfights are well-choreographed, but they become repetitive as the film progresses. There's only so much you can do with jets zooming through the sky before the action starts to blur together. By the time the climactic battle arrives, it feels like just another sequence of planes flying in circles rather than a true culmination of the movie's tension. The dialogue in Top Gun is another weak point. The film is full of cheesy one-liners and catchphrases that may have been cool in the 80s but now feel dated and cringeworthy. Lines like ""I feel the need, the need for speed"" and ""You can be my wingman anytime"" might work as nostalgic throwbacks, but they don't add much to the overall quality of the film. In the end, Top Gun feels like a product of its timeflashy, loud, and shallow. It's a movie that values style over substance, and while it might offer a few thrills, it doesn't hold up as a great film. The characters are one-dimensional, the story lacks depth, and the romance is unconvincing. Despite its iconic status, Top Gun ultimately feels more like an extended music video than a truly compelling piece of cinema."
257,ZEO_Doc7_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc7_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Negative,Top_Gun,"Despite its reputation as an 80s classic, Top Gun is a film that doesn't quite live up to the hype. Sure, it's got the high-flying action and the iconic soundtrack, but beyond that, the movie is plagued by a weak script, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of emotional depth. For all its style, Top Gun lacks the substance needed to make it a truly great film. One of the most glaring problems with Top Gun is its one-dimensional characters. Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, is introduced as a rebellious, daredevil pilot, and that's pretty much all we get from him throughout the movie. His character arc is minimal at besthe starts out cocky and ends the movie still pretty much the same, despite a few moments of supposed introspection after the death of his best friend, Goose. But even Goose's tragic death doesn't seem to have a lasting impact on Maverick's behavior, and the movie quickly shifts back to its action-heavy focus without exploring the emotional fallout of such a significant event. The romance between Maverick and Charlie (Kelly McGillis) feels particularly underwhelming. Their relationship develops almost out of nowhere, and their scenes together lack chemistry. It feels more like an obligatory romance subplot than a meaningful part of the story. McGillis's character, who is supposed to be a brilliant civilian instructor, is reduced to little more than Maverick's love interest, and her role in the film is disappointingly shallow. While the action sequences are well-shot and the aerial stunts are impressive, they can't compensate for the film's other shortcomings. The dogfights, though exciting at first, become repetitive after a while, and the movie's pacing suffers as a result. There's only so much that can be done with jets flying through the air, and the film doesn't find enough ways to keep these scenes fresh or engaging. The film's tone is another issue. It takes itself far too seriously for a movie that is essentially about a group of hotshot pilots competing to be the best. There's very little humor or levity, and the moments of drama feel forced rather than earned. Top Gun tries to present itself as a serious, emotional film, but it lacks the character development and narrative complexity to pull it off. Finally, Top Gun is a movie that feels more like a long-form commercial for the Navy than a film with a real story to tell. It's slick and polished, but it's also hollow. It's all surface, with very little depth beneath the glossy exterior. For a movie that's supposed to be about pushing limits and testing one's abilities, Top Gun plays it safe, never really challenging its audience or giving them something to think about. In the end, it's a fun watch if you're looking for 80s nostalgia, but it falls flat as a cinematic experience."
258,ZEO_Doc8_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc8_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Negative,Top_Gun,"Top Gun may be remembered as an iconic 80s movie, but when revisited today, it doesn't hold up as well as one might expect. The film is filled with visual spectacle, but it falls short in areas that truly matter, like character development and a coherent plot. Directed by Tony Scott and starring Tom Cruise as Maverick, the film leans heavily on its aerial combat scenes and a now-famous soundtrack, but these elements can only carry the movie so far. One of the major issues with Top Gun is its lack of meaningful character arcs. Maverick is introduced as a cocky, arrogant pilot with a devil-may-care attitude, and by the end of the film, he's still mostly the same person. His transformation feels superficial at best. Yes, there's the tragic death of his best friend Goose, which is supposed to be the catalyst for his growth, but the emotional fallout is glossed over far too quickly. Rather than delving into Maverick's grief or guilt, the movie quickly shifts back to its action sequences, leaving a lot of potential depth on the table. Speaking of the action, while the aerial combat scenes are visually impressive, they become repetitive after a while. The dogfights, shot with real jets, look great, but after the third or fourth sequence, the excitement starts to wear thin. There's not much variation in the way these scenes are executed, and the film doesn't seem to have much else to offer besides the spectacle of jets flying in formation. After a while, it feels like the movie is just going through the motions, using the same tricks over and over without adding anything new. The romance subplot between Maverick and Charlie (Kelly McGillis) is another weak point. It feels shoehorned into the film without much purpose or chemistry between the two leads. Their relationship develops abruptly, with little buildup or emotional connection, making it hard to invest in their romance. McGillis's character, who is supposed to be a strong, independent civilian instructor, ends up being reduced to a love interest with little substance. The scenes between Maverick and Charlie are awkward, and the dialogue in these moments feels forced and unnatural. One of the most frustrating aspects of Top Gun is its failure to make use of its supporting cast. Characters like Iceman (Val Kilmer) and Viper (Tom Skerritt) could have added more to the story, but they are largely underutilized. Iceman, who is set up as Maverick's rival, never gets the chance to develop into a fully realized character. Their rivalry is resolved in the final moments of the film with a brief handshake, but it feels rushed and unearned. In the end, Top Gun is a film that values style over substance. It looks great, sounds great, and has some memorable moments, but it's hollow at its core. The plot is thin, the characters are underdeveloped, and the emotional beats feel shallow. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, Top Gun doesn't stand up"

It's a classic example of style over substance, where the focus is on creating a flashy, adrenaline-pumping experience rather than telling a compelling story or building complex characters. The main problem with Top Gun lies in its central character, Maverick, played by Tom Cruise. While Cruise brings his usual charm and energy to the role, Maverick as a character is frustratingly one-dimensional. From the start, he's depicted as a cocky, rule-breaking pilot who believes he's better than everyone else. Unfortunately, this doesn't change much by the end of the film. Maverick's supposed transformation, triggered by the death of his friend Goose, feels rushed and incomplete. Instead of delving into the emotional consequences of Goose's death, the film quickly shifts back to more dogfights, leaving little time for character reflection or growth. The romance between Maverick and his instructor Charlie (Kelly McGillis) is another weak point. Their relationship feels more like a plot device than a genuine connection, and the lack of chemistry between the two leads doesn't help. The love story doesn't add much to the film, and it feels shoehorned into the narrative to appeal to a wider audience. Charlie's role as a strong, intelligent woman is overshadowed by her function as Maverick's love interest, and her character could have been much more impactful if she had been given more depth. Beyond the lackluster character development, Top Gun also suffers from repetitive pacing. The aerial combat scenes, while well-executed, start to feel monotonous after a while. There's only so much excitement you can generate from jets flying in formation, and the film doesn't do enough to differentiate each sequence. By the time the final battle arrives, it's hard to feel truly invested because the stakes never feel high enough. The film's dialogue is another issue. It's filled with cheesy one-liners and cringeworthy exchanges that haven't aged well. While lines like ""I feel the need, the need for speed"" may have become part of pop culture, they don't add much to the overall quality of the film. The dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, particularly during the romantic scenes, which only adds to the film's lack of emotional engagement. Ultimately, Top Gun is a movie that prioritizes spectacle over storytelling. It's more concerned with looking cool than telling a meaningful story or exploring its characters in any depth. While it may have been groundbreaking in terms of visual effects and action sequences, it falls flat when it comes to delivering a compelling narrative. For all its hype, Top Gun feels like a hollow experience that fails to live up to its reputation as a classic."
260,ZEO_Doc10_Top_Gun,ZEO_Doc10_Top_Gun,ZEO,Action,Negative,Top_Gun,"For all its flashy visuals and high-octane dogfights, Top Gun ultimately fails to deliver a compelling story or well-rounded characters. While the film may have cemented Tom Cruise as a Hollywood star, the movie itself is more style than substance. Directed by Tony Scott, Top Gun showcases impressive aerial sequences, but that's where its strengths largely end. As an action movie, it's visually stimulating, but as a narrative, it falls short in nearly every other area. The biggest issue with Top Gun is its lack of character development. Maverick, played by Cruise, is introduced as a cocky, rebellious pilot, and by the end of the movie, he's still more or less the same. The arc that's supposed to show him maturing after the death of his best friend Goose is rushed and doesn't feel fully earned. One moment Maverick is grieving, and the next he's back in the cockpit, seemingly unaffected. The emotional impact of Goose's death is handled poorly, and the film moves on far too quickly without giving Maverick a chance to truly process the loss. As a result, the supposed growth of the character feels shallow. Another weakness of Top Gun is its predictable and underwhelming plot. The storyline revolves around Maverick's time at the Top Gun Naval Flying School, where he competes against other pilots, most notably Val Kilmer's Iceman. However, the rivalry between Maverick and Iceman is barely fleshed out, and their eventual reconciliation feels anticlimactic. The film sets up Iceman as the antagonist, but he never gets enough screen time or development to truly become a compelling foil to Maverick. By the time they shake hands at the end, it feels like a forced conclusion rather than a natural progression of their relationship. The romance subplot between Maverick and Charlie (Kelly McGillis) is another weak point. Their relationship feels contrived and lacks chemistry. Charlie, who is supposed to be a brilliant civilian instructor, is reduced to little more than a love interest with a handful of cliched lines. The romantic scenes between Maverick and Charlie are awkward and don't contribute much to the overall narrative. In fact, their interactions often feel like they're just there to pad the movie's runtime rather than add anything meaningful to the story. Even the iconic aerial combat scenes, which are often cited as the film's standout moments, start to feel repetitive after a while. The initial dogfights are exciting and visually impressive, but as the movie goes on, the novelty wears off. The film relies too heavily on these action sequences to keep the audience engaged, but without a strong emotional or narrative core to support them, the action starts to feel empty. By the time the final battle arrives, it's hard to care because the movie hasn't given us much reason to be invested in the characters or their journey. In the end, Top Gun is a movie that looks great on the surface but lacks the depth needed to make it truly memorable. It's a fun"
261,DHZ_Doc1_Pitch_Black,DHZ_Doc1_Pitch_Black,DHZ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be inside a spaceship cracking apart during a violent crash landing, Pitch Black gives you the experience bright and early. The camera jiggles around spasmodically, the actors shout unintelligible gibberish at each other, the sound hammers us. Unfortunately, this describes too much of the rest of the movie, too, without a crash landing as an excuse. Pitch Black is yet another insecure hissy fit of a movie  a thriller without enough confidence in itself or its characters to calm down for two seconds and let the actors speak to each other like human beings. Movies like this copy the who-goes-there thrills of Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing without those films' grubby, everyday, human-scaled group dynamics. Here, the spaceship in question is carrying a motley crew mostly headed for someplace called ""New Mecca""; in addition to the expected Muslims (led by Keith David, of The Thing), there's a geologist, an antiques collector, a morphine-addicted cop, a teenage boy who's not what he seems, and a serial killer. This all smacks of gimmickry  these aren't people, they're conflict units. In Alien and The Thing, the people confined together were allowed personalities which could then flare up. The only people in Pitch Black with anything resembling a personality are the serial killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and the ship's pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), whose soft features juxtapose nicely with her tough nature. Mostly, the people wander around on the parched, godforsaken rock they've landed on, squabbling over how to escape, while gradually being picked off by slithering monsters who thrive on darkness. Of course, this planet has three suns and thus no darkness, but wouldn't you just know a total eclipse happens to be approaching? Pitch Black does have an imaginative look. Whenever the characters step outside into the alien air, cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) bleaches out everything, which makes sense: These are alien suns whose light is passing through an alien atmosphere, so of course things will look different. And I liked how Riddick, whose eyes have been doctored to allow him to see in the dark, emerges as the unlikely hero who alone can see the ravenous monsters. The Riddick's-eye view of the beasts is a neat touch of psychedelia. Problem is, you may wish you could see through Riddick's eyes all the time. Pitch Black, like so many other horror movies in recent years, is too often so dimly lit that you can't tell what's going on. Yes, the latter half unfolds during an eclipse, but a film can be dark and still be visible (perfect example: Carpenter's Halloween). The expensive, computer-generated creatures lurk around in the dark, revealed to us only in teasing flashes  perhaps for the best, considering that what we do see looks heavily indebted to H.R. Giger's Alien/Species designs. And the editing, as usual, is far too jangled; if you don't like a shot, wait two seconds and it'll change. I always"

It boasts a mixture of stock characters and regrettably ""clever"" characters that, all things considered, would have been better off with a few more cliches wrapped around them, with performance ranging from the perfectly adequate to the largely unfortunate. It is plagued by dialogue that fails to give any character a differentiated style of speaking, nor anything to say that resembles human speech rather than screenwriting exposition. And yet it's a pretty terrific film all around, regardless. One could dance around, trying to come up with many different reasons why this is the case, but it's actually pretty simple, at the broadest possible level: Pitch Black was made by a director, David Twohy, who plainly likes the kind of generic hybrid (sci-fi, action, horror, creature feature) that he put together here, and was very concerned to make this one as effective as he possibly could. It's junk - sheer, unmitigated junk - but it was made with absolute respect for the junk that it was; that cannot be faked or replicated in any other way, and Pitch Black is so committed to the story it's telling and how it's telling it, that it simply works. It's a crisp, well-oiled machine, and I honestly can't think of any way to improve it without requiring that it be something totally different than itself. It helps a lot that the film, at heart, has the kind of pared-down high concept that rings out like a heavenly symphony: a spaceship crashes on a planet with three suns that has a certain species of predator that only comes out in absolute darkness. The crash happens to coincide with an eclipse that only occurs once every 22 years, and is the only time that the planet surface is ever actually dark. Moreover, one survivor of the crash is a brutal murderer with surgically altered eyes that permit him to see in total darkness. Shake well, pour over ice. Yeah, it makes some dubious leaps: they crash right before the once-a-generation eclipse? - but this is the kind of movie where a faintly ludicrous scenario is secretly part of the fun; if contrivance is what it takes to pit an army of murderbeasts against a musclebound action antihero with glow-in-the-dark eyes, then contrivance it is to be. For that is, at any rate, a scenario worth getting to: in Twohy's hands, this high-concept nonsense is fun and thrilling, wildly propulsive (the 112-minute director's cut - I have not seen the shorter theatrical cut - blasts by with the crammed urgency of a far shorter, more efficient picture), and full of just enough creativity in the setting and production design, headed up by Grace Walker, that you don't have to feel guilty about liking it; if I call it one of the more fleshed-out"
263,DHZ_Doc3_Pitch_Black,DHZ_Doc3_Pitch_Black,DHZ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"Pitch Black is action science-fiction that barely qualifies as action and not at all as either science or fiction. Vin Diesel (Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room), who is waiting for something better to come along, and Radha Mitchell (High Art), who barely pretends an interest, star as the two leaders of a crew of space travellers marooned on a sinister planet. Mitchell, the co-pilot of the crashed craft, had considered jettisoning the passenger compartment with its dozen or so paying travellers until stopped from doing so by her co-pilot (Cole Hauser). Of course, this revelation comes to light, but even that opportunity for narrative progression fails to enliven the main thread of this yarn, the millionth knock-off of the Aliens films to misunderstand completely what makes those films such extraordinary entertainments. Ripley, Ash, Bishop, Newt, and all the other participants in those narrativeswell, perhaps less in the case of the latter two filmscomprised fascinating human communities, who each had their own views of each other and, therefore, their own plans for battling the alien(s), even their own notions of what the aliens were. Pitch Black, following its title, is totally in the dark about character development. It constitutes a significant (and much-praised!) arc in this picture for Diesel, a technologically-augmented killing machine, to help fight the good fight with the rest of the castaways when they begin, obligatorily, to be assaulted by flying, carnivorous outer-space nasties. That's the best description I can give of the beasts, who look a little like hammerhead shark-pelican hybrids as designed by H.R. Giger. What the desperate strandees soon discover is that the creatures can only move (nay, survive) in darkness, so all movement must be done either by day or in the presence of bright electric lamps, flares, lightning bugs in a jar . . . Anything in this paragraph that sounds like a joke is not, and that extends to the imperialist plunderer trying to save his excavated bottles and trinkets, nor to the very spiritual black man whose presence all but negates the other character's implicit poke in the ribs at colonialist stereotypes. We also have on board a transgendered person whose obviously female anatomy made the ""surprise"" gender-bender on the flunked WB dramedy Young Americans seem like a Hitchcockian coup de revelation, and whose presence (not to mention his exposure) advances the narrative not one iota. Given the low-fi cast and the crude nature of the effects, Pitch Black can't possibly have cost much to make, and yet I still can't believe what could have been done in the world with the money squandered on this turkey. There is something terrifically un-poignant about watching a picture destined not to be remembered, especially when its own cast seems already to have forgotten they are making a movie. Space junk of the lowest echelon."

They can't all be Casablanca and, shocking as it may sound, not every filmmaker is a genius. Occasionally, we the audience must put our principles aside in order to enjoy the modest pleasures of a given flick. To do otherwise flirts dangerously with art-house snobbiness. If we can lower our sights, however, we may end up enjoying ourselves far more than we have any right to -- turning an otherwise forgettable piece of tripe into a genuinely good time. Case in point: Pitch Black, a small sci-fi film that bears an unsettling resemblance to a much bigger one. The similarities to Alien are obvious to even a cursory glance, and the plot follows the same pattern as a dozen other cheap knock-offs -- an eclectic group of people, trapped in a colorful locale while inhuman monsters hunt them down one by one. This isn't just well-worn territory; it's scraped down to the bedrock. But Pitch Black resolutely sets out to make the most of this old chestnut, and -- wonder of wonders -- actually manages to pull something off. The future. Somewhere in the depths of space, a long-distance transport crashes on a barren world. The survivors find themselves blasted beneath the light of three suns, low on food and supplies, and stalked by one of their own: a convicted killer (Vin Diesel) en route to some prison hell-hole. But the worst is yet to come -- a race of giant fanged nasties lurking in a series of nearby catacombs. Thankfully, the monsters hate the light, and on a planet with three suns, there's never any night. It would take a total eclipse to set them loose on the surface... As I said, the premise is hardly original. But director David Twohy and a talented cast and crew elevate the material beyond its modest beginnings. Twohy and cinematographer David Eggby have taken some interesting steps to make their alien world appear...well, alien. Not through CGI imagery or run-of-the-mill special effects, but from more old-fashioned techniques, such as lighting and film stock. The movie has a grainy, high contrast look that leaves a strong impression. The light appears brighter, while the air has a harsher quality than Earth's. We're never allowed to forget that there are three suns in the sky, or that the nearby planets move differently than ours. Most sci-fi worlds look uncomfortably like Burbank; this one evokes an alien landscape the way few ever have. With that as a back-drop, Twohy keeps the action taunt and intense. While special effects are in abundance, he relies more on character interaction and plot twists to drive the story. It's tough not to jump in places or to get a few goosebumps, even though you know who's going down and when. The characters, too, are more than just cardboard cut-outs, with enough interesting aspects to keep us interested. Radha Mitchell's tough-talking female pilot has all the signs of a Sigourney Weaver"

It is better than most of this genre. Actually, the genre goes back farther than that, to the old 1951 sci-fi classic ""The Thing From Another World,"" starring James Arness as the monster, and maybe farther than that. In this version, the survivors of a crew and passengers of a spacecraft crash land on a distant planet only to find, lurking in the shadows, vast quantities of monsters, something like swarms of giant, flying piranha. Thanks to the wonders of digital effects, these things look real, and so does the planet with multiple suns and a giant Saturn-like companion planet whose eclipse allows the monsters to come out and play. The effects are very well done. From the glare of multiple suns to the partial eclipse caused by the ring of the neighboring planet, you get the feeling of being on another world. All the characters are complex, from the devout followers of Mohammed (this is one of those rare films that portrays Islamic characters as normal, not as terrorists) to bounty hunter William J. Johns (played by Cole Hauser of ""The Hi-Lo Country""), who is not at all the person he at first seems to be, and neither is the convicted killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel of ""Saving Private Ryan""). Almost every character has a dual nature, with one side hidden from the rest. It makes for a more interesting story. The science in the science fiction, however, leaves much to be desired. The monsters are such efficient predators, they have killed off nearly every other form of animal life on the planet. With nothing to eat, they have resorted to killing each other off. A predator species with nothing but itself to prey on (and the occasional human) will not last long. What the monsters need to do is send off travel brochures to earth so they will have more humans to eat. Other parts of the story do not bear close scrutiny either, such as the way the crash survivors get caught out in the dark, even though they know the eclipse is coming and they have found a usable spaceship a short distance from their crash site. They also happen to find a complicated model of the solar system which shows how and when the eclipse will occur. Furthermore, this is an old-fashioned (even by today's standards) mechanical model, not a computer model as one would expect in the far future. It works well, however, for purposes of illustrating the plight of the survivors. Despite the scientific and logical lapses, it is a pretty good adventure yarn with some interesting twists and turns. The pace is fast enough to keep one from worrying about small details like I mentioned above. The three-sided battle for control of the group of survivors between Riddick, Johns, and"

The camera ricochets around the chamber, dark and hard to read, save for the standard emergency beeper lights. The narrative voice over offers a context: ""They say that most of your brain shuts down in cryosleep, all but the primitive side, the animal side."" Unidentified as yet, the speaker identifies his fellow travelers, a ""hoodoo man,"" ""some kinda woman,"" and, as he puts it, ""my real problem, Mr. Johns,"" while you see the usual fast-cut, skewed frame pod-shots. Then you see who's talking -- or perhaps, thinking -- this introduction, an imposing musclehead wearing chains, jaw-lock, and blindfold, in the only pod labeled ""Lockout Protocol."" For all the regular visual and narrative cues attending his preamble, this single shot suggests that this guy is not your average narrator. Damaged by something ""unknown,"" the ship crashes onto a planet surface, hunks of it burning and breaking off as it accelerates through the atmosphere. During this terrifying descent, you witness a conflict between the pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell) and that problem fellow, Johns (Cole Hauser): she wants to save at least the front part of the ship by ejecting the ""passengers,"" he wants to try to save everyone. Her attempt is thwarted, not by his entreaties to her humanity, but by the fact that the mechanism doesn't work. And so, everyone crash-lands together, excepting the Captain, who's still in his pod when he's pierced through by whatever it was that assaulted the ship. The survivors are understandably afraid and angry to be stuck on a desert planet, but they take a few moments to thank Fry for her excellent piloting, for saving their lives. Unsurprisingly, she's a little uneasy with this display. With this opening sequence, Pitch Black -- co-written by brothers Jim and Ken Wheat with director David Twohy -- asserts outright its derivative sources, quoting from the Alien, Mad Max, and Terminator series, Blade Runner, Fearless, Con Air, and The Fugitive, even Stagecoach, in the outlaw traveling with a group of ""civilized"" folks. Fry, the reluctant hero, recalls Ripley and Sarah Conner of course, but also most hard-ass guy-protagonists in recent SF-action movies, motivated less by morality than self-interest. Mitchell, the Australian actor last seen playing a callow New York photo editor in High Art, imbues Fry with contradictions: she's girlish and stony, ambitious and careful, vulnerable and cruel. Resentful and confused, she finally accepts the role of ""leader"" out of desperation, defeated by her ostensible teammates' repeated ineptitude, carelessness, or myopia. In other words, Pitch Black is not about a motley crew that pulls itself together in order to triumph over common adversaries. Rather, it's a study of illogic, frustration, and disharmony, the stuff that's not supposed to happen in standard action pictures. Further, it examines community fractures arising from distrust, know-it-all-ness, and prejudice, all"

It has certainly seemed so lately, with such films as Soldier, Virus, and Deep Rising. Most recent SF action films have either taken themselves too seriously or suffered from broad, clumsy writing. Pitch Black is here to set the SF action genre back on course. In the noble tradition of Tremors and They Live, Pitch BlackPitch Black has no aspirations to be more than what it is--i.e., yet another Alien ripoff with a half-baked premise. It just wants to be a really good Alien ripoff with a half-baked premise. The recipe starts with decent acting from a cast content to inhabit their cliched characters, intriguing albeit low-budget special effects, superior production design, nail-biting action, sharp dialogue with the requisite one-liners, and a well-paced plot. One more element is needed, however. Even a derivative film, to succeed, must have something to set it from the others--a fresh element to make the film seem less stale than it really is, something that you can point to and say, ""That's some cool shit!"" That something is Vin Diesel (Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room). ""Fight evil with evil,"" the tagline urges. The evil? Radha MitchellComputer-generated creatures that look like a cross between the Alien monsters and bats. They are, of course, not particularly original, but director David Twohy (The Arrival), who makes the most of his small budget, has learned well the lesson of Alien--if you want to scare people's pants off, do not play your hand too soon. Keep the exact nature of the man-munching critters a mystery, and distract the audience with subplots. Like vampires, the alien creatures are unable to survive in the sun, but they inhabit the caves of an abandoned planet, now-deserted world. On this world, a spaceship carrying a group of would-be colonists headed elsewhere is forced to crash land, in an impressive and suspenseful action sequence. The survivors include baby-faced pilot Fry (Radha Mitchell, from High Art), spiritual Imam (Keith David, from There's Something About Mary), and law enforcement officer Johns (Cole Hauser, from Good Will Hunting and The Hi-Lo Country). The monsters do not immediately make themselves known, lurking underground. With three suns, the crash survivors are safe as long as they stay on the surface, which is always bathed in sunlight... or is it? The evil that the crash survivors fight back with?

In addition to being an expert in hand-to-hand combat, he has a convenient special ability--he can see in the dark. Once the lights go out, Riddick is their only chance to live, and Pitch Black kicks into high gear. Can Riddick be trusted?

Amateur astronomers (myself one) will raise many a deliberating eyebrow at the assumptions we swallow in order to accept this conjectural reality. The film opens with a space vessel transporting a load of commercial passengers (average people, save for the hardened criminal) all enjoying dreams in cryo-sleep (save for the hardened criminal). Suddenly, unknown objects rip through the walls of the vessel awakening all while killing the captain (of course). Now if this is bad luck, just wait ... ""Pitch Black"" defines the meaning of the phrase. The first mate, a sassy blonde, jumps to the pilot seat in time to see the surface of some planet swiftly approaching. In an effort to gain control of the speeding ship she quickly purges large sections of it ... including the payload (the passengers); but something's wrong, the lever sticks and she's forced to land with all on board. This sequence displays perhaps the most exhilarating graphics of the film. Atmospheric debris shatter the windshield into a splash of dust (miraculously, the pilot's pretty face isn't in the slightest marred). But still the menacing rush of dust and wind create a thrilling ride for the audience as the ship slides across the burnt orange surface of an unknown land. You'll sigh in relief when it finally comes to a stop. Looking out on the horizon, survivors quickly conclude that there will be no nightfall due to the multiple suns. Which is a good thing, because the planet is inhabited by ""a lot"" of nasty pterodactyl type aliens that don't like the light. But don't forget the bad luck factor; though the place is devoid of anything else, our travelers quickly stumble across an old mining factory, pick up one sample, instantly evaluate it as the last one, decode its age at 22 years (in unknown planet time, that is), then run over to a rather cool mechanical replica of the current solar system left by the human minors mysteriously killed 22 years back. The sharp unmarred pilot hand-revolves the geared planetary assemblage 22 times back into the solar system's history. The convenient counter clicks backward. Ah-oh, an eclipse! What are the chances of that? These poor kids just happened to be marooned on a planet inhabited by light-hating beasts on the very day of its 22-year cycle eclipse. With an hour's warning, the quickly dwindling troop still isn't prepared as the huge second planet with parallel rings rotating in opposite directions (not sure that's possible) rather swiftly blots out the sun. Despite the potential impossibility, it's a beautiful scene; the second planet's horizon cracking the sun as if to release from it a swarm of bat-like monsters into the honey-golden sky.

Suddenly, this largely unknown actor, whose only significant credits were a part in Saving Private Ryan and some voice work in The Iron Giant (as the title character), is a hot commodity with significant roles in two films opening the same day. Diesel fans are strongly advised to see both Boiler Room and Pitch Black, as they show different aspects of the actor's range. In Boiler Room, he's a regular guy working a regular job. In Pitch Black, he goes into full Arnold Schwarzenegger mode, flexing his muscles, grunting, and uttering the occasional one liner. It's not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb. Pitch Black can be viewed as a slick, stylish version of the kind of outer space creature feature that is typified best by the Alien movies. At its best (which is quite often), Pitch Black is an entertaining effort. On the down side, there are times when various largely anonymous characters wander around in the dark and do incredibly stupid things while being stalked by vicious alien creatures. As they get picked off one-by-one, the only question is who's going to be next. The last time writer/director David Twohy wandered into the science fiction arena, the result was the surprisingly intelligent and involving The Arrival, about an alien infestation on Earth. For most of Pitch Black, Twohy has brought the same level of thoughtfulness to this screenplay. The initial half-hour, which details the crash-landing of a spaceship on a barren desert planet, is particularly good. Once the first alien makes its appearance, things become routine from a storyline perspective, but the level of suspense escalates. To fill in the dead spots between alien attacks, we are treated to a series of recycled interpersonal conflicts. And, for those who are bothered by such things, the film's so-called ""science"" employs a few key violations of the laws of physics. The movie begins with the crash, a violent concussion that leaves most of the crew and passengers dead. Among the handful of survivors are Fry (Radha Mitchell), the pilot; Johns (Cole Hauser), a police officer; Riddick (Diesel), a convicted murderer who is being transported in chains; and Inam, a holy man (Keith David). The planet is an apparently lifeless wasteland - a desertscape where three suns assure that there is no night and possibly no water. Shortly after the rough landing, Riddick escapes, but, while the survivors are looking for him, they too are being hunted - by a species of alien that shuns the daylight but is lethal in the dark. Soon, with the realization that the world is about to be plunged into blackness by an inconvenient total eclipse, everyone must learn to trust Riddick, who can see in the dark, if they are to survive. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Riddick's primary goal is self-preservation or redemption. The acting is solid, if largely unremarkable.

Did some executive, considering greenlighting this script, chuckle evilly to himself while calculating precisely how insulting a movie he could produce and still have a decent opening weekend? Or was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was? ""Aliens meets The Fugitive meets Con Air,"" is probably how writer David N. Twohy pitched his script. (Also credited as writers are Jim and Ken Wheat, which simply screams of fanboy brothers who wrote and, god knows how, managed to sell a spec script that had to be even more horrendous than what's onscreen, if the more experienced Twohy had to rewrite it.) Twohy  who actually did write The Fugitive, with Jeb Stuart  is also responsible for writing and directing another piece of junk science fiction, The Arrival, which is at least enjoyable on a Mystery Science Theater level. With Pitch Black, though, he descends to a new level of awfulness, in which even the film's highly derivative nature cannot make for campy fun. Pitch Black is not good clean bad fun  it is an insidious offense to any even halfway-demanding movie fan. Pitch Black starts out, if not exactly promising, then at least momentarily gripping. A commercial freight and passenger ship, traveling through deep space, encounters a meteor storm  the small projectiles that rip through the ship are enough to do it serious damage, as well as kill the captain as he sleeps in his cryo chamber. The pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), awakened by the ship to deal with the emergency, finds her ship already burning up as it screams through the atmosphere of a planet. In an intense, protracted sequence, the ship breaks up as Fry fights for control of it and manages to guide it to a not entirely disastrous crash landing on the planet's surface. It's the kind of sequence at the end of which you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief along with the characters. But Pitch Black immediately thereafter starts a long slide downhill that doesn't stop until the end credits roll. Only a handful of the ship's passengers have survived, including Johns (Cole Hauser: Good Will Hunting), a law-enforcement type, and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel: The Iron Giant, Saving Private Ryan), a thoroughly psychotic multiple murderer who, natch, has escaped his industrial-strength restraints in the crash. Besides Fry, there's also a Muslim imam (Keith David: Armageddon, Volcano) and several of his young sons, a teenage boy, and sundry others.

271,FZI_Doc1_The_Batman(2022),FZI_Doc1_The_Batman(2022),FZI,Action,Positive,The_Batman(2022),"Matt Reeves' ""The Batman"" isn't a superhero movie. Not really. All the trappings are there: the Batmobile, the rugged suit, the gadgets courtesy of trusty butler Alfred. And of course, at the center, is the Caped Crusader himself: brooding, tormented, seeking his own brand of nighttime justice in a Gotham City that's spiraling into squalor and decay. But in Reeves' confident hands, everything is breathtakingly alive and new. As director and co-writer, he's taken what might seem like a familiar tale and made it epic, even operatic. His ""Batman"" is more akin to a gritty, '70s crime drama than a soaring and transporting blockbuster. With its kinetic, unpredictable action, it calls to mind films like ""The Warriors"" as well as one of the greatest of them all in the genre, ""The French Connection."" And with a series of high-profile murders driving the plot, it sometimes feels as if the Zodiac killer is terrorizing the citizens of Gotham. And yet, despite these touchstones, this is unmistakably a Matt Reeves film. He accomplishes here what he did with his gripping entries in the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise: created an electrifying, entertaining spectacle, but one that's grounded in real, emotional stakes. This is a Batman movie that's aware of its own place within pop culture, but not in winking, meta fashion; rather, it acknowledges the comic book character's lore, only to examine it and reinvent it in a way that's both substantial and daring. The script from Reeves and Peter Craig forces this hero to question his history as well as confront his purpose, and in doing so, creates an opening for us as viewers to challenge the narratives we cling to in our own lives. And with Robert Pattinson taking over the role of Bruce Wayne, we have an actor who's not just prepared but hungry to explore this figure's weird, dark instincts. This is not the dashing heir to a fortune prowling about, kicking ass in a cool costume. This is Travis Bickle in the Batsuit, detached and disillusioned. He's two years into his tenure as Batman, tracking criminals from on high in Wayne Toweran inspired switch from the usual sprawl of Wayne Manor, suggesting an even greater isolation from society. ""They think I'm hiding in the shadows,"" he intones in an opening voiceover. ""But I am the shadows."" In the harsh light of day, Pattinson gives us hungover indie rock star vibes. But at night, you can see the rush he gets from swooping in and executing his version of vengeance, even beneath the tactical gear and eye black. As he's shown in pretty much every role he's taken since ""Twilight"" made him a global superstar in 2008, working with singular auteurs from David Cronenberg to Claire Denis to the Safdie brothers, Pattinson is at his best when he's playing characters who make you uncomfortable. Even more than Christian Bale in the role, Pattinson is so skilled at making his beautiful, angular features seem unsettling. So when he first"

You heard that right: Mercifully, in Hollywood's latest effort to begin Batman yet again, director and co-writer Matt Reeves skips the venerable, too-oft-told origin story. No pearls. No popcorn. No alley. No mugger. I come before you today to make it known: Our long bational nightmare is over. Be honest: If I hadn't told you this, you'd have spent the entirety of The Batman's two-hours-and-fifty-five-minute running-time (!) crouched defensively in your theater seat, hovering in a constant state of low-level dread, waiting for those damn pearls to start hitting the pavement yet again. Well, I'm here to tell you: They don't.

To the Movies back in 2018. The part of me in question is my inflated ego, because I predicted the joke would have that effect, back then.) We love the Oscars  but we need to talk about those awards ceremony changes POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR We love the Oscars  but we need to talk about those awards ceremony changes Setting the scene (in Gotham) Smartly, The Batman begins in media-property res, as it were, establishing that wealthy scion-of-the-city Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) has been strapping on a bulky bulletproof batsuit for two years, spending his nights clomping around rooftops and delivering beatdowns to street gangs and robbers and their ilk. (The film's Foley artists really earn their keep; the Caped Crusader's every footfall resounds like thunder, and every time he turns his head we hear the squeak of worn leather.) He's already found an ally in not-yet-Commissioner Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), and his butler Alfred (Andy Serkis) has more or less gotten used to Bruce's Chiroptera-themed war on crime. Even so, he's carrying a lot on his shoulders, over and above all that Kevlar. There's a serial killer (Paul Dano's Riddler) targeting some of Gotham's most prominent citizens and leaving clues for Batman at his crime scenes. There's a cocktail waitress who's gone missing and her friend Selina (Zoe Kravitz) is prepared to slap on a cat-eared beanie and deal with the mobsters who took her. Selina's boss, the Penguin (Colin Farrell, buried under mounds of prosthetics) may or may not be mixed up with all that, and is definitely mixed up with Gotham crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Sponsor Message Reeves and his co-writer Peter Craig have settled upon a back-to-basics approach to Batman and his world. Where Tim Burton went goth, Joel Schumacher went swoonily over-the-top, and Christopher Nolan strove for a kind of stoic, masc, gunmetal-gray realism, Reeves' The Batman seems less hung up on stylistic flourishes that betoken his particular directorial perspective and more concerned with combining disparate, pre-existing elements"

Ben Affleck blew it, and even Christopher Nolan, who brought unprecedented levels of realism and gravitas to that franchise-best Batman saga, couldn't improve on what he'd created in his 2012 sequel. So what is ""Cloverfield"" director Matt Reeves' strategy? Answer: Go darker than ""The Dark Knight,"" deadlier than ""No Time to Die"" and longer than ""Dune"" with a serious-minded Batman stand-alone of his own. Leaning in to those elements doesn't automatically mean audiences will embrace Reeves' vision. But this grounded, frequently brutal and nearly three-hour film noir registers among the best of the genre, even if  or more aptly, because  what makes the film so great is its willingness to dismantle and interrogate the very concept of superheroes.

Alan Moore memorably asked, influencing decades of spandex-clad savior stories  though Reeves does something relatively unique here, at least by comic-book-movie standards: He strips the genre of its supernatural elements (even more than the Nolan trilogy did) and introduces a more complex version of a classic pulp hero who's only a whisker's breadth removed from the story's bad guy, morally speaking.

He's talking about how the presence of the Batman can be used to intimidate bad guys, but it's also possible writer/director Matt Reeves took this to heart for his approach to rebooting the famous superhero. This is the scariest Batman yet. Right from the violent opening scene, the message is clear: this is not your mother's Caped Crusader. This is a creeping, angry, white-knuckle-inducing psychological thriller with a heavy dose of crime noir  and believe it or not, Reeves absolutely pulls it off, achieving a grimly beautiful masterpiece. The Batman stands on its own, but it's still dripping with cinematic references. Among the movies I thought about while watching: Zodiac, Se7en, Chinatown, and Saw! You know what I didn't think too much about? Most of the previous live-action Batman movies. Its gritty realism is most similar to Christopher Nolan's trilogy, but this is a refreshingly bold new cinematic take on the Dark Knight. The Batman: How Robert Pattinson's Batsuit Draws From the Past Click through for a look at how Robert Pattinson's Batman costume evokes many incarnations of Batman from the comics and video games. Anyone hoping Pattinson's Bruce Wayne might opt for a more traditional, spandex-style costume will have to accept this isn't the direction director Matt Reeves is going. If anything, this may be the most heavily armored Batsuit we've seen in the movies to date (not counting the more extreme costume changes Ben Affleck's Batman underwent in Batman v Superman and Justice League). 13 IMAGES We can't help but think of the Arkham Asylum video game series, particularly the most recent two entries, 2013's Arkham Origins and 2015's Arkham Knight. The chest area and the uneven texture of the Bat emblem definitely invoke the Arkham Knight suit. The way the shoulder pads seem to be separate pieces attached to the chest armor is very reminiscent of Arkham Origins. It makes sense that Origins in particular would influence the new movie. All signs point to The Batman taking place relatively early in Bruce's costumed career, and Origins is also set early on. The Origins suit is specifically intended to be less sleek and polished than some of Batman's later, more advanced costumes. We may well see the look of this costume evolve over time, assuming the planned trilogy of movies pans out. Few artists have a more striking and unique rendition of Batman than Lee Bermejo. The artist behind dark, gritty graphic novels like Joker and Batman: Damned, Bermejo has a very detailed take on the Batsuit that seems to have directly inspired the Pattinsuit. Bermejo's Batman is a heavily armored force of nature. The suit is divided into a series of armored plates and sharp, angled lines, a design sensibility this new movie suit seems to share. The Bat emblem is easily one of the most unusual features of this new costume, what with its piecemeal quality and multiple components."

Fans of Gotham's best detective might enjoy The Batman, which is a dark and gritty Batman picture. Despite the fact that it took me a long time to get into this nearly three-hour cinematic showcase, it is ultimately a multi-layered detective noir meets action thriller that may be one of the best Batman movies to date. When a ruthless killer leaves a trail of cryptic clues, Batman goes underground in Gotham City. He must develop new contacts, unmask the offender, and deliver justice to the misuse of power and corruption that has long plagued the metropolis. As the evidence leads closer to home, the enormity of the perpetrator's ambitions become apparent. The Batman is an actual work of art. It's about more than just solving a mystery; it's about exposing corruption in Gotham City, making it feel memorable while also providing more substance than many other movies. The atmosphere that Matt Reeves creates here is incredible. Gotham is the best it's ever been; it's filthy, dark, and filled with fear and corruption. Giacchino's musical score is outstanding and one of the best for a Batman film. Greg Fraser's cinematography is incredible; there are so many memorable shots and gorgeous colors and eye-popping lighting when the film goes all out. Robert Pattinson is a fantastic Batman who is both vulnerable and imposing. This is probably my favorite live-action portrayal of Batman I've ever seen. He's a terrifying force of nature, and the way criminals react to him is brilliantly depicted. This film recognizes that Bruce Wayne is the man behind the mask. Another aspect of The Batman that I appreciated was the idea that this is only Batman's second year, which means we get to witness him make errors. The supporting cast is also fantastic, with Paul Dano and Colin Ferrell standing out as the Riddler and the Penguin, who steal the show every time they appear on the screen. The Riddler is a fantastic villain with real motives. The Riddler's character is elevated to a whole new level in The Batman, as fans are introduced to a very dark and twisted nature that is wonderfully and eerily depicted. Catwoman or Selina, played by Zoe Kravitz, was terrific. By far the best Catwoman seen on screen. Not only did she have a perfect look, the way she talked and moved felt so spot on to the character. Furthermore, Batman's dark tone and violent feel, combined with The Riddler's truly sinful nature and Batman's obvious mental suffering throughout the picture, raises this film to a new level not previously seen in Batman films. Overall, I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars. Although the movie felt a little long and dragged out at times, I think the film was played out perfectly."
276,FZI_Doc6_The_Batman(2022),FZI_Doc6_The_Batman(2022),FZI,Action,Positive,The_Batman(2022),"For years there has been one thing separating the Marvel Cinematic Universe from the DC Cinematic Universe, and that was a love for the source material. You could tell that every director for the Marvel films really analyzed and cared about the source material, knowing when to stray away from it, and when to stick right to it. Films like ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" taking some of the most iconic scenes from the comics and putting them right on the big screen is what comes to mind. ""The Batman,"" which hit theaters on March 4, is the first DC movie I have watched in a long time that I can firmly say the director and the writers all understood who and what the Dark Knight is. The plot, acting and cinematography are all qualities that make this the quintessential ""Batman"" film with only minor issues. Pause Unmute Remaining Time -0:11 Picture-in-Picture Fullscreen Matt Reeves, who serves as director and writer, made a daring and incredibly smart decision by forgoing the backstory that a majority of ""Batman"" films introduce. The film takes that step even further by restraining itself from showing the brutal murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, which is something I have seen multiple times throughout the ""Batman"" films. Now even with their deaths not being shown, the movie doesn't shy away from showing the impact the Waynes had on Gotham. The central plot of the movie surrounds two points: The immense corruption of Gotham at its heart, which all divulges from the history of the Waynes. The second being The Riddler's serial killings of major police and political figures among Gotham. The movie sets itself in an era of Batman we have seen and also not seen enough; it's a young, Robin-less Batman, fighting crime and trying to keep Gothman from the brink of tearing itself apart. It takes pieces from the many different authors of the ""Batman"" comics and lumps them all together that feels eerily like what Batman is: he's not funny, he's not cracking jokes like in the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, he's a man that's been broken by a city's corruption and is doing whatever he can to make sure nobody experiences what he did. Robert Pattinson, known for his work in ""Twilight,"" was announced as the next to don the cowl in mid-2019 according to Variety, and to say the reaction to the decision was mixed would be an understatement, according to screenrant. But from the start I had a gut feeling that he was going to succeed in the role despite his previous work, and I can say proudly I feel that Pattinson did an amazing job at understanding the character and the mannerisms that accompany Batman. One thing I have not seen mentioned nearly enough is the movement patterns that he shows throughout the film while he is in the suit; he walks almost like a predator does when stalking their prey. His movements are all purposeful, which makes you really understand and connect"
277,FZI_Doc7_The_Batman(2022),FZI_Doc7_The_Batman(2022),FZI,Action,Negative,The_Batman(2022),"Spoiler alert I said what I said. Before anyone rolls their eyes at me, let me tell you that I have seen Val Kilmer plastered with bat nipples. I witnessed George Clooney pull out a Batman credit card. I beheld the sight of Ben Affleck change his mind about murdering Superman after he realized that their mothers had the same first name. But while all of those Batman portrayals either made Batman silly, stupid, or sad, The Batman did something I cannot forgive: they made Batman boring. It's difficult to know where to start with this one since I feel like I am arguing with the entire world, but I will begin by stating what was good about the movie. It was shot beautifully 2. The Penguin Waddles That's it. Now, to the bad. Lazy Character Development of Established Characters Before watching this film, if you would have asked me what I thought of the idea of skipping the Batman backstory that we have already seen so many times, I would have told you that I support that decision. But you have to fill it in with something. This movie establishes that these are new versions of characters we already know and love. They do this not only by a new cast and costumes, but they show Batman in the disguise of a regular motorcyclist, Catwoman has a new backstory, Alfred is younger, etc. But the new versions of the characters are far less interesting. In Batman himself, gone is the tension of having to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy. Instead, we get a mopey emo brat who spends his days with sunglasses on who refuses to play the part of Bruce Wayne and who drops lines like: ""You're not my father"" to his butler. They did the best job with developing Catwoman, who at least had a character arc of deciding to save people after Batman forcibly stopped her from killing someone else. Not a great, or even good character, but Zoe Kravitz gave a decent performance. But Alfred... wow. If someone takes issue with me referring to this Batman as the worst of all time, they must concede that this was certainly the worst Alfred of all time. After getting about two minutes on screen, one of them where he gets told he is not Bruce's father and another where he decrypts a code after Batman shows him how to do so, Batman figures out that Bruce Wayne is the Riddler's next target. The next scene finds Alfred away from the phone while Batman is trying to reach him. Then, he finds a letter marked for Bruce Wayne which he snoops into, and then he gets blown up (but somehow not killed). Alfred, a character who is defined by his efficiency, trustworthiness, and wisdom shows the exact opposite of all of these traits and we're still expected to care that he got hurt. Even the off-screen character development of Thomas Wayne. The doctor who shares the"

There's a category of movie that used to be the Hollywood stock in trade, which a dear departed relative used to call ""brain cleansers""one kicks back, the time passes with some rooting interest, some excitement, some curiosity about what's coming next. For its first two hours or so, ""The Batman"" largely fulfills the commitment to be engaging and clever; its deftly inventive director, Matt Reeves (who co-wrote the script with Peter Craig), conveys the impression of substance where it's hardly to be found. The movie is good with an asteriskan asterisk the size of the financial interests at stake in the franchise's intellectual property. As free as Reeves may have been to make the film according to his lights, he displays an element of custodial, even fiduciary, responsibility. It may well win him favor with the studio, with the ticket-buying public, and with critics who calibrate their enthusiasm to box-office success, but it gets in the way of the kinds of transformative interpretations of the characters that would make the difference between a baseline movie and an authentically free and original one. The Batman is a vigilante who works with the cooperation of the police, who project a bat-sign into the sky, with a bright light, as a call to him and a warning to evildoers who anticipate him swooping in. Yet, as he lands on a subway platform and lays low a gang of young miscreants, made up Joker-style, who are assaulting an Asian man, the victim is also struck with fear and pleads with the Batman not to hurt him. The Batman describes his uneasy role as an avengerindeed, he says, as vengeance itselfin a voice-over that holds out hope that the superhero will be endowed with at least an average level of subjectivity and mental activity. No such luck: that voice-over might as well be a part of the explanatory press notes for all the insight it offers into the protagonist's thoughts. Yet his haphazard thwarting of random street crime in the chaos of Gotham City gets sharply focussed on one criminal, the Riddler (Paul Dano), who, in the opening act of his crime spree, virtually summons him.

Pattinson Doesn't Fit Obviously, Robert Pattinson as Batman is the only aspect of this movie that makes it remotely interesting. Unfortunately though, Pattinson as Batman didn't work for me. Ezoic Is it just me or did Robert Pattinson's accent sound off at times? Some moments I heard his British accent and sometimes he even sounded a bit country. There were definitely moments of dissonance where I was like  wait a minute, who is this? Oh yeah, it's supposed to be Batman. Another discrepancy with Pattinson is that it didn't seem like he fully embodied Bruce Wayne as a holistic character. Forgive me for digging up the past but he looked more like an emo vampire than a reclusive, old-money, rich politician. My brother was the one who pointed out how Pattison's hair didn't match the Bruce Wayne vibe. Ezoic As Anna Delvey would say, he looked poor. A little unkempt. He looked like he lacked dignity and confidence. He didn't hold the air of someone who came from money. He was just a broody, boring Batguy the whole time. There was no distinction between Batman and Bruce Wayne which makes it quite unbelievable that his identity was a secret to most people. 2. The Characters are Shallow I could not care less about Catwoman. The movie had a whole 3 hours to introduce us to who these characters were and still, after all that time, they were complete strangers to me.

Matt Reeves' ""The Batman"" introduces audiences to a new iteration of the Dark Knight  emo. The film, which arrives in theaters on Friday, has elicited mixed reactions from critics. Some have praised the nearly three hour-long feature as a deconstruction of the superhero genre, others found it to be a dark slog. Warner Bros. ""The Batman"" skips past the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, the spark that inevitably leads the young billionaire down a path towards becoming Batman. Set during the character's second year as the masked crime fighter, the film follows the vigilante as he tries to capture a serial killer who is targeting corrupt officials in Gotham. The standalone feature does not connect back to other films in the DC Extended Universe. Robert Pattinson dons the cowl with Zoe Kravitz taking on the role of Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, and Paul Dano terrorizes as the Riddler. Other members of the cast include Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth and Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin. ""The Batman"" currently holds an 86% ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 217 reviews. Here's what critics thought of the film ahead of its Friday theatrical debut: Bilge Ebiri, Vulture Unlike previous iterations of the comic book character, there's little differentiation between Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman in Reeves' film, Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for Vulture. The film doesn't spend much time on Bruce's struggle with leading a double life. Here, the billionaire is a brooding recluse who rarely makes public appearances, unlike other adaptions which have portrayed him as a playboy or gregarious businessman. ""Robert Pattinson's Batman walks so gingerly, so quietly into most of his scenes in Matt Reeves's 'The Batman' that at times you wonder if he's meant to be more ghost than superhero,"" Ebiri wrote. ""...Pattinson is a tall, handsome, strapping fellow, but he plays Bruce Wayne with such broken, mournful despair that his body is practically concave when it's not in a batsuit."" The film also reframes the typical superhero trope of subtle similarities between the good guy and the bad guy. Here it's overt, Ebiri wrote. ""Reeves shoots Batman's pursuit of his targets with the same psychotic, heavy-breathing, point-of-view aesthetic with which he shoots the Riddler's,"" he said. ""Now, we have to try and figure out how the hero differs from the villain  and so too does Batman."" Read the full review from Vulture. Robert Pattinson stars as Bruce Wayne in Warner Bros.'

281,UCT_Doc1_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT_Doc1_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT,Horror,Positive,Drag_Me_To_Hell,"Hi! Years and years ago.....A guy called Sam Raimi made a couple of films called Evil Dead. Scary scary movies ahead of their time. But over time Sam moved away from the horror genre and directed films like Darkman and the Spider-Man trilogy. If he wasn't doing that he pasted his name on and produced really really bad horror movies like The Boogeyman. So imagine my surprise when i heard that he was actually directing a horror movie again! After seeing it last night here is my review. I do enjoy horror films......but i don't like them. That doesn't make sense but what i mean is i LOVE horror movies but all horror movies today are utter crap. The only scary movies made today are all Korean. Then America, with their complete lack of originality and money grabbing ways, make a remake with low standards. The last horror movie i went to see was The Unborn and that is THE WORST MOVIE i have seen in a long time and the worst horror movie as well. Drag Me To Hell is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. In the films opening sequence the plot device is introduced in a chilling manner. It opens the film perfectly and the goosebumps go all the way through the opening credits. Christine has a fairly nice life until she denies an elderly woman an extension on her mortgage. Then the main part of the plot is opened in a sequence that is tongue in cheek funny and scary (classic raimi). From here on out it's scares piled upon scares. Sam Raimi doesn't follow the usual horror movie cliche of.........long......drawn-out......silences.....THEN LOUD NOISE TO MAKE YOU JUMP! He actually builds suspense with a neat little musical score. High pitched violins carry your nerves then throw them in the air! That's another thing. The film doesn't have a great focus on visual effects but the sound effects are fantastic. Tension building and atomospheric sounds and music are put to amazing use. The story is a good set up. It is an original film with an original story. It isn't plagerised or a cheap money making remake from Korea. Although the story is limited and the film run time is of average length. The film is classic Raimi and there are lots of references to other films by him. It's good to know that super massive Hollywood blockbusters haven't diluted his great direction and how he used to make films all those years ago. He keeps a good balance of humour and serious scenes by using humour when necessary and never ruining the atmosphere. Throw all this in with a disturbing shock ending you have the best horror film i've seen at the cinema in a long time! I'm sure you'll agree. Enjoy."
282,UCT_Doc2_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT_Doc2_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT,Horror,Positive,Drag_Me_To_Hell,"From the intense opening scene to the stellar and shocking finale, Sam Raimi has officially returned to the horror genre with vigor and spark in the year's best horror film so far. Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver. Christine (Lohman), a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend (Long), is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity, she comes across an old gypsy woman (Raver) who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss (Paymer) tells her it's a tough decision, and its her call, so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated, the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse, one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell. Lucky enough to have won tickets to a pre-screening of the film, I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise, the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny, they can go overboard, but not this one. In fact, I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II. Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film, Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways, this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG-13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense, scary horror films in quite some time, despite the PG-13 rating which many tag as already crap. Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks, and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know, but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing, just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience. Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of"

The 1981 horror classic featured everything a good horror movie is supposed to be: scary, gory, at times weirdly funny, and entertaining. When I saw ""The Evil Dead,"" I wondered if Raimi would ever return to horror again. 2009's ""Drag Me To Hell"" is the answer that was given. Raimi has finally gotten a chance to leave the ""Spiderman"" franchise and actually do something that old fans would remember him by. There's only three words to describe ""Drag Me To Hell"" and those words are: A PERFECT MOVIE! Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a woman who is living a happy life with her boyfriend Clay, and she has a great job at the bank. But when an old gypsy woman, Sylvia Ganush, comes to Christine, begging for another extension on her mortgage payment, Christine is faced with a challenging decision. Will she impress her boss and win the assistant manager position or will she help Mrs. Ganush out and never be able to make tough decisions? Christine goes for the first choice. Bad mistake, because Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on Christine. It is the curse of the Lamia, a furious demon that tortures its victims for three days until it finally drags you to hell to burn for eternity. Can Christine be able to find a way to stop the curse before it's too late? Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a superior horror film with nonstop scares, gratuitous gross-out moments, a very dark sense of humor, and it's fun to watch. Raimi doesn't just put Christine through hell, but he does it with the audience too. I was jumping in my seat so many times, talking to the screen, and I actually felt my adrenaline pumping, stuff that hasn't happened to me in a long time in a horror movie. It makes you remember classic horror film rules: If a disgusting gypsy woman with bad dentures, a blind eye, leper fingernails and endless phlegm coming out of her mouth needs your help, you don't ignore her. You help that woman out! There are plenty of slashers and haunted house movies, but there aren't so many people getting cursed. Raimi's horrific story is just a little bit formulaic, but he takes it and makes it his own. Gypsy curses have never been this violent or scary. The cast obviously had a good time making the movie because their performances are awesome. I really enjoyed watching Alison Lohman play Christine. I haven't watched a lot of her movies, but this one shows that she's very underrated and deserves bigger roles. Great job, Lohman! Justin Long has starred in another very popular horror movie called ""Jeepers Creepers."" He is also very good here as Christine's boyfriend Clay, the dude who is always telling her that everything is okay and nothing is"
284,UCT_Doc4_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT_Doc4_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT,Horror,Positive,Drag_Me_To_Hell,"It is about bloody time Sam Raimi returned to what he does best: insanely awesome, scary, tense, funny, gross horror!! Ever since I first saw and fell in love with The Evil Dead three years ago I knew Raimi was a master at scaring people one minute and making them laugh the very next. Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness only proved my theory further. But after Army of Darkness there was a long break from horror, which was not a bad thing, as he made some excellent movies in this time (The Quick and the Dead, A Simple Plan and Spiderman 2). So, after 17 years he has returned with Drag Me to Hell, a terrific comeback and one of the best (and the most original) horror movies since 2000. What makes this film so good is that Raimi knows what he is doing, what he wants and who he is making this for. As he said in an interview I recently saw, he does not make these movies for art snobs, but for the horror crowd of which he says are the most welcoming of audiences. Everything from his flawless direction, the fast pace, a strong story as written by the Raimi brothers and a solid cast combine to make this a movie worth seeing more than once! Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer gunning for the assistant manager position, but has to compete with the new guy, Stu Rubin, for it. Her boss mentions that he is not afraid to make the tough decisions, and that she should think about that while working. Unfortunately for her, the tough decision she makes involves Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) and this does not end well for her when Mrs. Ganush places the Lamia curse on her. This curse will lead her into hell if she can't find a way to get rid of it, and it does not help her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) is skeptical. What follows is a non-stop, freaky, funny, disgusting roller-coaster ride that leads to an astonishing ending. Lohman does not get a rest as she is thrown around like a rag doll, berated, vomited on and has various body fluids spray onto her and into her mouth. All this is completely over the top, and is incredibly funny, however, Raimi does manage to pack some genuine scares. He knows how to seriously ratchet up the horror, and he knows how to work the camera to his advantage (much like he did in The Evil Dead). Alison Lohman does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part, she sure can scream! Justin Long is good as usual and manages to keep his role interesting rather than cliched, had it not been handled correctly. Lorna Raver is just plain amazing as the villain of the piece, she is just so frightening and really, kudos should"
285,UCT_Doc5_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT_Doc5_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT,Horror,Positive,Drag_Me_To_Hell,"Wow! I love Sam Raimai. He has created masterpieces. Evil Dead? The king of horror. It was badly misunderstood with it's campy effect, but now is known as one of the best. The Spiderman trilogy? This is probably the best trilogy next to the Dark Knight's. He knows how to direct a film without being serious, and taking a break from all seriousness can be great sometimes and we actually need it. But with Drag Me to Hell, I have big expectations. I read the critic's reviews stating that this IS Raimai's return to what we known and loved, and guess what? It surpassed all expectations. Sam Raimai has this thing with this film, where he takes this forgettable, cliched story and turns it inside-out. When I first read the plot summary, I really thought it wouldn't turn out to be what it was all cracked up to be. Wrong. He inserts his formula of horror slash comedy and wraps it up in his special entree. And he did a fantastic job. What I liked best was how Sam got away with his PG-13 rating but still keeps all his formula there. We have the gross-out gags, which were hilarious to watch, while also managing to make us look away in disgust. But that's all we wanted, we got it. The movie was actually a bit scary, just like the original Evil Dead. He knows how to mix horror + comedy in a great fashion, where we don't know which one was present more of. And again, the movie was hilarious! If you're not too sure of black comedies, especially ones that mixture with horror, then this won't be that great to you. But every scene was excellently done, and this was the return of the horror/comedy king! Now what saddens me is that people gave this bad reviews. It was understandable, but films much worse than this are rated higher, but are so much more cliched. People didn't understand that the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously, was supposed to be a bit campy, and was expected to actually make you laugh. But the critics are the ones to listen to here, and recommend for all people ready to be disgusted, to laugh, to be horrified, to have fun! Drag Me to Hell was a treat, and one of the most entertaining movies of the best decade. And special kudos for the ending, which was one of the craziest twists ever. Now people saw they saw it coming, but I'm 75% sure they didn't, and they wanted to feel a bit better about themselves. Anyways.. Drag Me to Hell was a treat, and one of the most entertaining movies of the best decade. 9/10."

Shouldn't have used the word ""great."" Let me try again: This was not, I repeat, NOT a good movie. Ahhhh, that's better. I like Sam Raimi's work enough although I'm not a very big fan. I really think he enjoys a semi-cult-like popularity that leads some folks here to close their eyes on the many flaws and write positive reviews about this weak Raimi offering. There are several very big problems here. The main one starts with the unconvincing performance of Alison Lohman playing the protagonist Christine Brown. I have not seen her in a lot of movies but if I have, her work must have been as forgettable as this one. Miss Lohmann comes off as a B-actress with very little range here. In many scenes I could have sworn they had just called her to the set as soon as she was done memorizing her lines. Those lines came out of her mouth just like a junior-high student trying to pass an oral exam by only memorizing from the text book instead of actually learning the topic. Miss Lohman should not take all the blame for this, though. Her character is so unbelievable that when she has her first sequence of violent spirit activity in her residence she merely shuts a door and goes back to her normal life. After the third or fourth such evil-spirit violence she calms down enough to go out with her boyfriend and talk about how nice a night it is! The writing is very weak and feels rushed. As if the script was written in one Saturday afternoon. The dialogs are so lame that I'm not sure if even Meryl Streep could have made lemonade out of it. Justin Long who does a good job in those MAC commercials looks like he is having a hard time keeping a straight face with this script. To be fair the individual set pieces are somewhat effective and in a couple of occasions even somewhat scary. But this is far too rare here. The Cheapest way filmmakers try to scare you is with gore-galore. The second cheapest, in my opinion, is when you are give sudden loud ""scare"" scenes designed to make you jump from your seat. While Mr. Raimi keeps the gore to a reasonable level he profusely relies on sudden shock shots to scare you. Ah yes, there's a third cheapest scare tactic and it's not so much a scare tactic as it is a make-you sick tactic. Bloody vomit is really passe but Mr. Raimi does not let that bother him. He also serves us saliva-soaked yellowed dentures, corpse vomit and a host of other yuks. That stuff worked for ""The Exorcist"" because it never felt like the director was feeding it to us just because he could. It does feel that way here. And oh yes, what was up with the boyfriend's parents? Imagine caricatures of"

I don't understand the positive reviews and praise? This movie was terrible disgusting schlock. Also, a complete rip-off of Stephen King's Thinner which also a shitty movie. This was supposed to be a horror comedy? First of all this movie is neither scary or funny. They might as well called this jump scare the movie. Take a drink every time there a loud jump scare scene. There's an unnecessary scene where the main character stabs and kills her cat. She got what she deserved when she was dragged to hell at the end. Good riddance!The acting is horrible and dry. Alison Lohman is an awful actress. No wonder her acting career ended after she did this movie. Her line delivery is horrid. You never believe anything coming out of her mouth especially when she tries to act angry or swears. She sounds like she's reading off cue cards. She also lacks reaction to anything crazy going on around her. She pretty much ruined this movie for me with her bland emotionless performance. She had that same stupid blank worried face the entire movie. I just wanted to punch her in the face! I was rooting for the gypsy woman to kill her! Justin Long and Alison Lohman have zero chemistry and make for boring leads. I felt like they were both miscast. Justin Long felt outta place in this movie. He looked like belonged on set of Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer. He pretty much phoned in his performance as he slept walked all his scenes. The gypsy came off more hilarious than scary. Every scene with her was a joke! This movie is way over the top and just plain old disgusting. They're replacing suspense and horror with blood, guts, and potty humor. This movie basically Alison Lohman getting attack absurdly and nastily every 5 minutes. This movie is full of gross. Burping up a fly, dentures flying out of mouths, old lady sucking on people's chins, vomiting bugs and maggots in somebody's mouth, bloody nose squirting blood everywhere, shoving arms don people's throats, possessed talking goat spouting profanities, spooky flying handkerchief's. None of this is scary or funny. Just childish, cheesy and stupid. If this wasn't made by Sam Raimi it would have gotten negative reviews and trashed by fans and critics. This movie sucked! Forgettable characters you don't care about, not scary, not funny, bad acting, dull plot, repetitive fake out scenes, gross out humor, lack of a musical score. It's is one of the most overrated horror films in the last couple of years. Sorry fans, this crap has nothing the on Evil Dead films. Those films were classics. This garbage is forgotten tripe."
288,UCT_Doc8_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT_Doc8_Drag_Me_To_Hell,UCT,Horror,Negative,Drag_Me_To_Hell,"No spoilers here, just some general points. This movie is a poor attempt at recreating something like The Evil Dead, but if the fact that I laughed through this entire flick tells you anything, it should be that it's not a horror movie. Not by a longshot. It's more like a disgusting comedy, with a lot of things that are so badly done that they make you laugh instead of scaring you, and a lot of really gross stuff thrown in to try to make you stop laughing. The movie didn't really look interesting from the advertisements but I gave it a chance because it's Sam Raimi. In terms of quality, think less ""Spider-Man"" and more ""Evil Dead 2"" with a bigger budget. And then even if you liked The Evil Dead 2, think of this as an even less-scary version of the same basic idea. (To be fair, I did enjoy TED and TED2, and particularly TED3: Army of Darkness, but they weren't very scary unless maybe you were 12 when you saw them.) Then again, any time they refer to a movie as having a ""cult following"" it usually means it sucked but some people liked it anyway. Compounding the facts that this movie wasn't scary, overly interesting, or particularly well-done is the fact that at its root, it's an 1:39 Mac commercial. Yes, it stars Justin Long, the infamous ""Hello, I'm a Mac"" tool who already owns your television for a good portion of the day by virtue of his employer's bloated advertising budget. The man should stick to Mac commercials because his acting is appallingly bad, so much so that my wife said he could easily be Keanu Reeves' son. Everyone in the movie has an iphone, and uses a Mac, because Macs are great computers. Oh wait, no, it's because Justin Long works for Apple, and Apple blows ridiculous amounts of money on ""subliminal"" advertising. Say, how come those ""I'm a Mac"" commercials never mention that Apple would've gone out of business if PC, er, Bill Gates hadn't bailed them out? Ooops. Back to the movie - overall the characters were very caricature-ish, hardly believable, the story was weak, the acting was bad, it wasn't scary, and the special effects - well, they were Sam Raimi-ish, if that means anything to you; again, think Evil Dead 2 with a bigger budget. All in all, a total failure of a movie, and don't let the people who are still pining over The Evil Dead and its sequel convince you otherwise. This movie is BAD."

Sam Raimi returns after his successful ""Spider Man"" franchise and returns to the ""Evil Dead"" nostalgia he left us off with in 1987 bring us ""Drag Me to Hell"". Let me first note this is not a Horror movie, hardly a suspense movie. Lets just call it a ""Wanna be movie"". The plot revolves around Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) lives a normal life in present day Los Angeles working as a bank loan officer. After losing a promotion to her co-worker Stu (Reggie Lee), her boss tells her to become more strict of a loan officer and try to be more assertive and in control. One day, an elderly gypsy woman by the name of Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) walks up to Christine and asks her for a third extension on her overdue mortgage payment. Christine denies her the mortgage to seem more assertive and to prove to Mr. Jacks she has what it takes for the promotion, apologizing to her and saying there is nothing she can do. Ganush becomes angry at her and attacks Christine. She is taken out by guards a few moments later. Fretting the issue, Christine gets into her car at the end of the day and is attacked by Ganush (which is very similar to the attack sequence in P2) who then puts a curse on her that she will be sentenced to Hell in three days. After confronting her boyfriend (Justin Long), she then seeks help Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a fortune teller who tells Christine she will be going to Hell in a matter of three days. He convinces her to make an animal sacrifice, to which then she kills her cat. I shall admit this is the first movie I have walked out on in seven years (The Master of Disguise in 2002). It was not scary, a waste of my time, and after she killed the cat, I knew I was done. I have never been a fan of Raimi's films, I will have to admit I never liked them. After seeing this, I'm guessing Raimi's ""Spider Man 4"" will be a little darker with satire seeing as in this film it's one of the darkest things he has done. I should also mention this movie experiments a lot with effects. It uses including green screen, puppets, prosthetics and computer-generated imagery throughout. That's probably the only highlight since this movie wasn't at all scary. The scene were she kills her cat was completely unnecessary, I found it saddening and just a ruin to what could have been a ""decent"" (and I use that term lightly) movie. Especially seeing as the Horror in this movie is very limited. The awkward silence scenes are screaming JUMP SCENE at you hoping you will jump. This movie tries to be something"

I had seen MySpace ads around as well as a commercial I barely glimpsed at. Still like a typical horror movie I went in expecting greatness, despite being disappointed 9/10 times. Now, prior to going in I was unaware the man who made this also did the Evil Dead series. In all fairness I loved those movies as a kid when my dad showed me them on VHS. They were scary and weird so it was still enjoyable despite the oddness. Drag me to Hell on the other hand, well I seriously considered leaving the theater. If you want to simply jump throughout the movie you're in luck, it uses about 20 or so cliche suspense moments to get you scared. Now, I've watched plenty of horror movies in my day so disliking the movie had nothing to do with disliking ""gross"" things- but the amount of goo in this movie was just unnecessary and only there for the sake of being gross. While I now understand the comical-horror scenes in this movie (As I'm now aware of the creator) for newcomers to the maker, or just casual moviegoers in general it doesn't make sense to be in there. If we come for a scary movie we don't expect to see Looney-Tune situations. Laughter amidst a horror movie may be a nice break and all, but it just makes the movie look silly, low budget, badly written, and not serious considering the rest of the movies mood. The acting for this was mixed, it was either over the top and unneeded or just awkward. Later we meet the Boyfriend's parents who are clearly wealthy. While they went for a ""smug rich people"" act it just seemed like acting of a cheap television show. Personally I found the music and sounds to be terrible in this movie, I apologize if this is coming off as a rant but I'll explain. Drag me to Hell is LOUD, extremely so; in the suspense scenes people were covering their ears due to the loud pitch. Musically it was just inappropriate, during one particular horror scene they chose a Jazz-like bass rift. CGI in the movie was decent, nothing award-winning but it worked despite certain scenes looking as if they were from the 1987 Evil Dead film. The style mirrored that of ""My Bloody Valentine"" where everything appeared ready for 3D (assuming you didn't see that in 3D) On paper, the plot is good. Or at least it started good, though realistically its just your typical ""Somethings going to possess you and haunt you, we need to do an old ritual to end it"" film (See also: The Eye, The Unborn, Etc.)

291,WJC_Doc1_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc1_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty_Grandpa,"""Dirty Grandpa"" is the latest in the line of vulgarian comedies that tries to succeed off of a cheap formula. The formula is that it's so vulgar, tasteless, and irreverent that, eventually, by chance or by fate, it will get a laugh out of its audience. It may only be one, it may only be two, it may be only every ten minutes, or even more sporadic and inconsistent than that, but it will eventually get a laugh or two out of you. The problem is the entirety of those laughs often amount to about a minute or two of actual comedy, and in this case, enduring the remaining ninety-six minutes is quite an arduous task for such a feeble reward even a monk would pass up. With that being said, I counted two hearty laughs in ""Dirty Grandpa,"" and several sporadic chuckles from Jason Mantzoukas's rowdy and zealous performance as a local small-business owner/drug dealer in the film. That latter fact already sends up quite a few read flags, as this is a comedy where the emphasis rests on the age-gap and the talent of the two lead performers, Robert De Niro and Zac Efron respectively. While the two men exercise what seems to be a lack of boundaries and restrictions on what they'll allow themselves to be put through in this film, none of this particularly helps their credibility and further distracts both from the wealth of more interesting roles they could be taking. The film revolves around Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), a lawyer who is looking to wed his longtime fiancee in a little over a week. After the death of his grandmother, Jason's grandfather Dick Kelly (Robert De Niro) asks if he could potentially drive him to see his old Army buddy and have some grandfather/grandson bonding. Despite the time-crunch, and knowing how distant his grandfather and father are, Jason takes him up on his offer and drives him in his fiancee's pink car, which Dick refers to as a mobile labia. It only gets better. While eating at a diner, Jason runs into Shadia (Zoey Deutch), an old friend of his, who is eating lunch with her friend Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), an unapologetically crass woman who is looking to complete her sex trifecta of having sex with a freshman in college, an alum, and a professor. Dick, in turn, comes to her rescue by claiming to be a professor and promising to show her a wild time. The gang winds up enduring a ribald weekend involving drinks, sex, and drugs, most of the latter supplied by the aforementioned Mantzoukas's Pam character, who exercises maximum comic potential in every scene. The way he steals the attention away from the two leading performances is very similar to how Bobby Moynihan's prankster Alex character did in last month's ""Sisters."" The problem is ""Dirty Grandpa"" is so reliant on the repeated use of four-letter words that it forgets that the characters, the context, and the conversational wit of the"

Talking about ""Jaws: The Revenge"" he once said ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!"" One can only assume that Robert De Niro has a similar attitude for getting involved in this dross. For that is what it is. Directed by Dan Mazar (""I Give It A Year""), its a desperate attempt at a Spring Break-style ribald comedy that misses at virtually every level. De Niro plays Dick (an appropriate name) who after a lifetime of marriage and on the day after his wife's funeral asks his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to join him on a road-trip to Florida, with the singular aim of getting laid by a fresher a quarter his age. (You can already tell that this is all in the best possible taste). Jason - an accountant - is due to be married in the following week to the prissy and controlling Meredith (Julianne Hough), against Dick's wishes. Needless to say with this paper-thin plot, (and given that America is obviously such a small place) he runs into an old (and naturally sexy and gorgeous) school friend Shadia (Zoey Deutch). With Dick applying a 'certain set of skills' from his previous work (hasn't this plot been worked before in a De Niro comedy?) he wreaks maximum havoc in Daytona Beach in trying to lead Jason astray. Will he succumb and find true love rather than fall into a marriage of boring expectation. What's there to like in this film? Well, there is some almost amusing sexual banter between de Niro and the nympho-like Lenore (Aubrey Plaza, and probably the best thing in the film). The great Danny Glover has a short cameo. The music used is well chosen(although the music editing seems extraordinarily inept). And if you are female (or male but gay) then the extended scenes of Efron's almost naked body might do something for you. But on the flip side, there are few groups that this film won't manage to offend. About 75% of the script is the F-word. It portrays extensive and casual hard-drug use. The film is offensive to gay people. Offensive to deaf people. Offensive to cancer patients. Offensive to black people. And deeply offensive to lovers of cinema. I have used enough words on this trash. Those UK readers who are old enough to remember the older style of film classification will remember that there was an 'A' rating. I would bring it back for this film, the 'A' standing for ""Avoid"". In fact, it was so offensive, the rating should be 'AA' for ""Absolutely Avoid"". I have a monthly cinema card, so I got to see this film for 'free'. I was significantly overcharged."

It also is extremely cliched, predictable, over the top, and the film has the most thin story line ever. But you excepted that already, the film provides however what it was mainly made for laughs . Its a stress buster film, and yes there are many things that bog down the film occasionally but at the end you enjoy yourself while watching Dirty Grandpa.Its also a film you feel that you have watched before, because while the jokes are not really new, what makes the film maybe a notch better then most sex comedies is Robert De Niro. This man is by the far the youngest man in the film, and he is outlandishly awesome, who knew the master of acting could play a wacky sexy manic grandpa to perfection, but more on that later. Story wise right before Jason Kelly's wedding, he being a uptight guy is tricked into driving his grandfather, a perverted former Army general, to Florida for spring break. What happens when Jason finds out his Grandpa just wants to get laid, and how he joins the party is what forms the rest of the plot of Dirty Grandpa. Acting wise Robert De Niro, is a revelation of sorts, who knew this man could play such a wacky, outlandish, and over the top character. We know he is one of the best actors ever, but he goes no holds bar for this film. He is so filthy its awesome, truly this man can do anything the acting sphere Watch out for his scene when he sings it was a good day by Ice Cube, that scene and many more scenes with De Niro had me laughing out loud. Zac Efron is passable as the pretty boy, when it comes to acting he has nothing much to do, other than show his body off, maybe he should try going to acting school. Critics have completely destroyed this film, its already being called one of the worst films of 2016, but I don't understand all the hate. Its way better than the fore night released "" Sisters"" which was accepted with open arms by critics. I don't know its beyond me why the film is getting such high hater. I mean the film is cliched, predictable, has no real amazing story, its a low IQ comedy, as I stated before, but is that not what you excepted from the film after the viewing the trailer. Moreover the film entertains, and however many the negatives like having a dumb love track, the familiarity issue etc, for me De Niro's wacky act rises above anything. It was so entertaining watching him go full retard in a good way. And honestly I enjoyed the raunchiness, the low IQ, outlandish jokes. Its also never a bad sight when the film is"
294,WJC_Doc4_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc4_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty_Grandpa,"I really don't have a problem with any genre of movies, even dumb juvenile comedies like this one, as long as they aren't dumb or terrible. This movie was a disaster in every imaginable way. It's a movie that's by the numbers and after the first 5 minutes you know everything that's gonna happen in the movie and maybe it would have helped if the movie was funny but there really isn't anything funny in this movie. I chuckled one time. The writing is terrible and pretty much everything about the movie is disgustingly bad. I want to clarify that there's a very big difference between good bad and bad bad movies. Movies like ""The Room"" are classics because they are so bad that you laugh at it because it's a complete failure and you enjoy it. But then there's bad bad movies where I really don't know how you can derive any enjoyment from it. This was bad bad. None of the characters are likable or even realistic. You can't identify to any one of them and you can't care about them because they don't feel like real people. The dialogue isn't realistic and the scenarios aren't realistic either. Every character in this movie feels either like a cartoon character or a straight up psychopath. The level of intelligence of the characters is basically zero. None of their actions make any sense and the whole movie just feels like a bunch of stuff happening for the sake of a joke and it's never cohesive. I literally have never said this before because I am really not insulted or offended easily, but this movie really was offensive and insulting. The difficult thing about reviewing a comedy is that it's really hard to pinpoint why something is funny or why it isn't, but this movie was definitely not funny. An example is in the beginning of the movie you kind of get to know the main characters cousin, who is just a total unfunny jerk and you don't see him for the rest of the movie until almost the ending. And the payoff to that ""joke"" happens like an hour later. So it takes way too long for them to get to the ""payoff"" and it doesn't work. That's the only joke I can think of that felt like it had a setup and at least attempted to have a payoff. Pretty much everything else was racist and homophobic jokes. It's pretty amazing how a crap screenplay like this can get sold but thinking about Hollywood it makes sense. It had the right stars attached to it with De Niro and Zac Efron so it appeals to a larger audience: De Niro for older folks and Efron for teenage girls who wanna see him shirtless for almost half the movie. It's a pathetic movie and it doesn't even deserve to be called a film because there's no coherence in the story. It's a movie that's clearly made to gain a profit"
295,WJC_Doc5_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc5_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa,"Okay, I know what you all may be thinking, Dirty Grandpa, the newest comedy featuring Robert ""Refusing To Take A Pay-Cut"" De Niro is just another sad excuse of a comedy featuring a world- class veteran actor whose acting days are numbered and career is slowly fading? Actually, the fact of the matter is, Dirty Grandpa is a very funny, very over-the-top, very rambunctious comedy with nothing but entertainment value, laughs and some good old-fashioned Hollywood fun at the movies, poking redeem fun at itself following the heavy and highly melodramatic Oscar burdened December month. I can think of so many other disappointing January films that I've seen in the past, that quickly make way onto my list of Worst Films of the year. Luckily for Dick Kelly (De Niro) and his lawyer loving grandson Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), the two won't be making their way to that list. Filled with deadpan dirty talk, highly sexualize jokes, crude, rude and obnoxious taboo social references, Dirty Grandpa becomes one wild and dirty-minded fun filled trip to start off 2016. Not that the film should be a reflection of the film caliber of 2016, but Dirty Grandpa never becomes a film that falls and cannot get back up. Instead, the first comedy of 2016 tells the similar story to Pixar's Up; but instead of the adorable Carl Fredricksen taking a wild trip on his hot-air balloon, Dick Kelly decides that, after a fifteen years abstinence, and with the loving approval of his dying wife, the secret ex-Military man decides to trick his favourite grandson along for a ride to Daytona Beach to find some horny and foul-mouth twenty somethings in a pink Mini Cooper. Kind of the same thing, right? What begins as a simple guys trip with golfing, dining and some male bonding, quickly turns into a wild weekend looking for answers for both men; sensory for Dick, and emotionally for Jason, who is unsure about his marriage to the all too perfect and tremendously overbearing Meredith Goldstein (Julianne Hough), who ultimately becomes the sexiest Bridezilla we have seen on film in a while. Luckily for our unlikely duo, answers quickly come, in the form of Lenore (Aubrey Plaza); a wild mouth lascivious college girl looking to bone a senior for the sake of completing a life long list of hers; and Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a free-spirited, organic loving, tree-hugging hipster who is the complete opposite of Jason's Meredith. With the girls off to Daytona Beach, Dick begs his grandson Jason to pursue them, knowing that Dick is surely going to be able fulfill his dreams of sleeping with a college student. Luckily for the audience, the wildly uncalled for sexual banter between the doe-eyed Plaza and De Niro is what we look forward to the most, making their dialogue the highlight of the film overall. I mean, how funny is it hearing De Niro shout out things like, ""Party 'till your pregnant!"", or ""I got news for you. That's the"
296,WJC_Doc6_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc6_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa,"I can't seem to pinpoint when it exactly began but comedy took a turn for the worse within the last decade. Then again perhaps it was PORKY'S that changed comedies from movies with well thought out dialogue to simple jokes about body parts and how they are used. Whenever it began the truth is most of these movies have moments where you laugh at some of the most obscene things occasionally but for the most part just wonder how they keep being made. The latest in this long line of off-color comedies is DIRTY GRANDPA starring Zach Efron and Robert DeNiro. Yes THAT Robert DeNiro. I know, it's stunning to think of what many considered to be the actor of his generation now in a film where he's trying to bed a hot college co-ed. And yet here we are. Efron stars as Jason Kelly, an up and coming attorney about to get married to the boss's daughter Meredith (Julianne Hough). As the film opens he's at the funeral of his grandmother where his cousin Nick (Adam Pally) acts inappropriate between sexual comments, conspiracy theories, drinking and smoking a grass filled ecig. After the funeral Jason's grandfather Dick (DeNiro) guilts him into driving him across from Georgia to Boca Raton, Florida. What should be a bonding between grandparent and grandchild begins with Jason finding his grandfather masturbating followed by what most would be considered an over usage of the F bomb as he tries to get Jason to help him find someone young to have sex with. The best chance of this is a coincidental meeting in a restaurant with a young woman Jason went to school with, Shadia (Zoey Deutch), and her two friends Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) and Tyrone (Brandon Mychal Smith). This trio is headed for Daytona and Dick convinces Jason to head there as well. What follows is the usual debauchery one expects with spring break in Daytona, a drug and alcohol fueled exploration of beaches, bars and hotel rooms with nothing but attractive men and women in the tiniest of swimwear. During a drinking contest with two addle minded lacrosse jocks Dick considers competition for his chance with Lenore he slips several crushed capsule he has with him in a drink to slow them down. Unfortunately Jason ends up drinking this cup, the result of which is him disappearing only to resurface drunk out of his mind and wearing only a stuffed animal over his most sensitive area. More sequences like this happen and in the middle of them we learn that Jason wanted to be a photographer at one time, Shadia is an environmental activist and that the pair have a mutual attraction. Tell me you can see where this is leading. The weakest part of this movie is the feeling that you've seen this before, the same exact story, but with slightly altered settings and moderately modified characters. I know every time I saw cousin Nick in this film I kept expecting to discover"
297,WJC_Doc7_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc7_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa,"Well, I guess that all I can say about this movie is that it is basically another one of those frat party films. You know the ones where a bunch of young people go off and have a party and the main characters meet women with whom they fall in love. Yep, it's one of those films. Oh, and there is a fair share of rather dirty jokes, and scenes, as well as copious drug references. So, I guess the question is, why did I go and watch it? Easy  Robert De Nero. I have to say that all I knew about this film was that it was about a grandfather who takes his grandson on a holiday to Florida days before his wedding  typical Hollywood plot  seen it a few times before. However one thing that caught my eye right at the beginning, when he was doing chin-ups, was the tattoo on his back. Right away I worked out that he was ex-special forces (typical De Nero), but since his grandson never blinked an eyelid meant that he was either completely obvious about its meaning, or he already knew. Turns out that he is completely oblivious. Anyway, there is a little bit more to that story than that. You see De Nero's wife had just died, and Effron is a junior in his father's corporate law firm and is about to marry a complete control freak of a woman. Once again typical Hollywood plot. Anyway, De Nero decides to take him to Florida, on the pretence that he went there every year with his wife, and since he has lost his license he needs somebody to drive him, so he decides to grab Effron (as opposed to the drugged out brother). There is a reason for this, and that is that Effron is about to make a really big mistake. You see this is one of those films that suggests that one should actually live life and pursue one's dreams. Effron is basically heading down the road of your modern day corporate zombie. Sure, he might have a good job and live a comfortable life, but in the end he will be married to a control freak and be basically a robot controlled by both his wife and his father. De Nero knows better (since he is the Grandpa), and realises that Effron is making a really big mistake, so he decides to give him an experience that he never had in college  Spring Break. Sure, the whole concept is a debaucherous drug-fuelled binge, but the thing is that it is not about getting wasted, it is about having fun, fuelling your passions, and marrying a woman with whom you will actually live life rather than exist within a semi-dead existence where your life, in the end, will be meaningless. For all of the criticisms that I may have against Hollywood, films like this do say one thing  life is to be lived, to"
298,WJC_Doc8_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc8_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty_Grandpa,"The title says it all! In fact, it should be called ""Dirty Movie"" because just about every character has a filthy mind and the majority of the situations they find themselves in lend themselves to crude sex jokes. Most of the jokes are related to sex so if it's variety you desire in your humour, you will have to see another comedy. I don't mind gutter humour but not at the expense of other forms of comedy. There are similarities with the recently released ""Sisters"" but at least that movie had the sense to include other types of comedy. Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) is an uptight lawyer who is only one week away from marrying controlling and domineering Meredith (Julianne Hough). Jason's grandfather, Richard (Robert De Niro) is at his wife's funeral and asks Jason to be his chaperone to Florida. After debating the issue with his own son and Jason's father, David (Dermot Mulroney), he reluctantly agrees to let Jason drive his father. Little does Jason know that his grandfather has plans to explore and indulge in things he hadn't been able to do while he was married to his wife. Along the way, they meet up with college students Shadia (Zoey Deutch) and Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) who party with them during their spring break. There are moments that provide genuine laughter but the initial impact of the sex jokes wears a bit thin due to their repetition. The biggest embarrassment is seeing an actor the calibre of De Niro hamming it up as the titular character. He was definitely in it for the pay cheque! If it wasn't for him in the movie, this would be reminiscent of one of those teen sex comedies that was rolling off the production line in the 1980s. The script by John M. Philips is juvenile, one that would make you question if it was written by a horny teenager. The shock value of hearing De Niro utter lines like ""I wanna f*^%, f*^%, f*^%, f*^%, f*^%"" dissipates when most of his lines comprise sexual innuendo and puns. Efron is trying to escape from his ""High School Musical"" days but if he wishes to be regarded as a serious actor, he has to make better choices with his roles as he is still the hot bod of the movie. Quite a few of the scenes are unnecessary as they are unfunny and extend the caricature of the characters, especially that of Grandpa's. It's not a totally lost cause however, with several scenes springing to life to entertain the audience. It's just a shame that the story reduces itself to dialogue about sex talk when there could have been other avenues explored. Let's just hope that this is not one of De Niro's final performances as he deserves better than being remembered as Dirty Grandpa."
299,WJC_Doc9_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc9_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty_Grandpa,"'I haven't had sex in 15 years and I wanna f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck!' 'Oh, so that's what this is all about??' Yes this is what this movie is all about, Robert De Niro's dirty grandpa character who has just lost his wife of 40 years, is now revealed to be a foul mouthed, booze obsessed pervert who wants to f*ck young girls. Its up to the young, clean cut and unaware Jason (Efron) to escort him from Georgia to his Florida retirement home. Aaand that's your movie in a nutshell people, sound familiar? Well that's probably because its been done a sh*tzillion times before. I mean honesty, who thought of this? who green-lit it? The entire concept is so cliche and dated, an old grandfather figure that turns out to be a dirty, loud mouthed, profanity spewing perv who also just happens to be an ex-special forces type so he can also kick ass if needs be. This of course means you're gonna get a sequence where he does indeed kick someone's ass much to the surprise of Jason his grandson. Naturally of course, the fact that grandpa is an ass- kicking, alcohol machine, means that the grandson character must be a total goodie goodie, a real preppy nerd type because its the perfect equal polar opposite match-up. Completely and utterly predictable, cliched, corny and unoriginal, the characters literally lay out the ground plan for the plot without even having to write a single word of dialog for them. And yes you've guessed it, that plot simply revolves around lots and lots and lots of binge drinking at parties, girls in skimpy bikinis, pool parties, beach parties, drinking, drugs, lame pranks, drinking, sex, nudity, drinking, jail time, muscle flexing and plenty of drinking. This is basically the modern frat boy flick minus any originality because frat boy flicks were a staple diet back in the 80's. So this odd pairing drive off on this road trip of sorts in an attempt to reach Florida. God knows how far they actually get because the entire flick is taken up with the duo getting into various parties so grandpa can try and get laid. This is against the wishes of a shocked Jason of course but he usually ends up getting tricked or drugged into it, then winds up enjoying it, then winds up waking up somewhere hungover and naked...or in jail, take your pick. The whole time Jason is also trying to hide all this outrageous behaviour from his very sexy, yet very prudish fiancee and his conservative parents. Anyway all I know is at one point they get to Daytona beach in Florida, no clue how they got there or how far they still had to go, but who cares. Now in all honesty the casting for grandpa Dick with De Niro is pretty good. De Niro is the obviously the perfect age and he has that perfect persona where you're not really sure what he's actually like, he"
300,WJC_Doc10_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC_Doc10_Dirty_Grandpa,WJC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa,"Dan Mazer, the director behind a lot of Ali G and I Give It A Year, also writes a lot, most recently Office Christmas Party and Bridget Jones's Baby with Bruno and Borat in his writing credits too, however, Mazer directs a story written by someone else, a fairly unknown John Phillips. Zac Efron plays the straight-laced lawyer boy, Jason Kelly who reluctantly agrees to drive his recently widower Grandfather to Florida, too soon. before his wedding. Robert De Niro slips comfortably into comedy mode and becomes this lecherous dirty old man on a mission to get himself laid, and possibly his grandson on the way. De Niro is stand-alone brilliant and steals the entire film. He's the Grandpa you're so ashamedly proud of, justifying his disgusting behaviour and attitude as he verbally slaps people in the face, sometimes physically. It's a role I can no longer see someone else do. He is the dirty Grandpa. What ensues is a totally wacky and hilarious road trip, not totally unbelievable, but way up there with silly over-the-top comical situations. Efron looks like he's been set up and pranked upon constantly, by his own Gramps who has quite a few tricks up his sleeve and possibly some state secrets too. The script is loaded with clever put-downs, mostly delivered by De Niro, with a heavy does of sarcasm. Plenty of awkward situations, and inappropriate embarrassments but without going to the extremes like some of the comedies released this year. It's just silly and the plot holes are quickly ignored due to the hilarities. Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Piaz pretty much make up the rest of the supporting cast, and the targets for De Niro, causing a major distraction for Efron who's soon to be married and cannot forget with the needy, dominating wife-to-be constantly calling for colour schemes, rehearsal arrangements and press releases. It's predictable but that doesn't ruin the film, it's like you already know the story and how it's going to pan out but it's then remixed comedy style which makes it forgivable. It doesn't pretend to be anything but a funny comedy. I've said before, all good comedies need good soundtracks, and this one is a great example of that, making full use of a suitable mixture to create the perfect atmosphere. It's proper laugh out loud funny, especially Jason Mantzoukas' Classic Pam. I suppose it's comedy I can kind of relate to, reminding me of my pals. It's a road trip with pals that's on always on form. Non-stop heckles, and pranks come-backs.
