0,BBP_Doc1_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc1_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Negative,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"A lot of the charm has been deep fried out of ""Kung Fu Panda,"" a not-uncommon malady among successful kids' cartoon franchises that have produced multiple films, and multiple seasons of a TV series. Three credited writers and the vocal stylings of Jack Black and Awkwafina can't render ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" into anything but semi-organized repetition, recycling and random riffs that rarely manage to interrupt the tedium or flatlining one-liners. ""I wish I had a dumpling for every time a villain told me 'how much we have in common.'"" It's like a later ""Transformers"" or Marvel movie, an umpteenth installment of your average action anime, where fan service and endless fights are all anybody involved can dream up. Our Dragon Warrior, roly poly panda Po (Black) is in his prime, cocksure in fights and enjoying his celebrity. That makes this the perfect time to ""Choose your successor,"" Master Shifu the wee red panda (Dustin Hoffman) intones. Po is reluctant to take ""the next step in your journey,"" senior spiritual management for The Valley of Peace. But that's of little consequence when old foes like the tiger Tai Lung (Ian McShane) come back from the spirit world, because a new foe, The Chameleon of Juniper City (Viola Davis) is summoning them and adding to her powers to theirs to take down The Dragon Warrior. A thieving ninja fox (Awkwafina) is arm-twisted into helping Po. His two dads (James Hong and Bryan Cranston) whine and fret over that. But there's nothing for it but to face a new enemy by making their way to Juniper City. That ""choose a successor"" business, all about ""You know when you know"" you've found the right warrior, will have to wait. Fortune cookie one-liners abound. ""Every step leaves a footprint, no matter how small."" ""It is easier to hang onto the life you know than reach for the life you don't."" ""It's never too late to do the right thing."" There are a few chuckles, here and there, but ""the right thing"" as far as this movie is concerned is more and more comical brawling. It's never quite a nine year-old's idea of ""cool"" and never as funny as one would hope. As Black's Master Po asks in the film's most telling line, ""Where's the skadoosh?"" The biggest laugh comes from the skipper whose Chinese junk sails to Juniper City on a regular run. Po negotiates with the pelican in charge. He thinks. Then the pelican opens its mouth and the ""real"" captain turns out to be a fish floating in seawater in the bird's bill. The comic Ronny Chieng, voicing the fish, makes more amusement out of that sight gag than anybody else here manages. Dreamworks built its animation empire out of smart-mouthed, sight-gagged character comedies like ""Shrek"" and ""Puss in Boots"" and ""Madagascar."" It's not shocking that they came back to the ""Kung Fu Panda,"" as, like Pixar, they've hit the wall when it comes to new ideas. But even they'd have to"
1,BBP_Doc2_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc2_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Negative,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"Throughout the course of the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, we've seen dim-witted, dumpling-obsessed panda Po (voiced by Jack Black) transform from a bumbling, underestimated rube into an insightful, self-confident warriora Dragon Master, to be exact. He's found his chi, taken a journey of self-discovery, learned selflessness, and harnessed the power to kick butt using kung fu to defeat a legion of ruthless villains. He's also broken a few ancient artifacts in his process towards enlightenment. Over the past 16 years, his saga has spun off additional adventures for Po and his pals in direct-to-DVD shorts, a few animated series, and a holiday TV special. It seems Po's greatest power has been the ability to become a massive, money-making franchise. Yet, after an eight-year absence from the silver screen, Po's return in Kung Fu Panda 4 has lost much of its creative spark. Directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) along with co-director Stephanie Stine (She-Ra And The Princesses Of Power), this next chapter has Po suffering from a career crisis, reluctantly seeking a protege and stubbornly defending against an enemy threat. While this may sound like a story fit for the Pandaverse, in execution it fails to prove itself worthy of cinematic inclusion. Instead of finding the perfect balance of humor as the other films did, jokes outweigh and occasionally undercut the few resounding sentiments on personal evolution. When we reunite with Dragon Warrior Po, he's in his element, subduing a giant stingray with the Staff of Wisdom bequeathed by the legendary, deceased master Oogway. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) feels the universe is revealing that it's time for Po to level up to the title of Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. Not only does this mean no more field missions for Po, it also entails having to choose a candidate to be the next Dragon Warrior. Since Po has no interest in changing his life, he drags his heels on both decisions. However, he can't stall for too long as there's a new adversary looming on the horizon. The Chameleon (Viola Davis)a shape-shifting sorceress who's more evil and egomaniacal than any baddie we've met beforeis looking to gain riches, power, and territory in a tyrannical takeover. First, she needs Po's special staff to open the spirit realm so she can let all the master villains loose and steal their martial arts talents. Once Po catches wind of her plan, he teams up with an unlikely ally: Zhen (Awkwafina), a cunning criminal who's as annoyingly scrappy as she is skillful. They set out on a road trip to the bustling metropolis of Juniper City, but the mismatched pair quickly learn that they're going to have to work together to save the dayand the world. Surprisingly, screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (who wrote the previous three Panda movies), along with Darren Lemke, have constructed a rote, generic journey for the titular hero and his new sidekick while his squad, the Furious Five, are off"
2,BBP_Doc3_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc3_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Negative,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"The trilogy ended in satisfying fashion in 2016 with the cuddly, constantly hungry Po finally coming into his own in his unlikely role as the Dragon Warrior. He is both the student and the teacher. He has the respect of the Furious Five and his mentor, Master Shifu. He's proven his bravery again and again in protecting the Valley of Peace from all manner of animal attackers. And he enjoys a loving and supportive bond with both of his dads: the restaurateur goose Mr. Ping and his biological panda father, Li. It's all good. Eight years later, ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" struggles to justify its existence. It lacks both the delicate artistry and warm wit of its predecessors. The subtle sense of spirituality is long gone; in its place are frantic action sequences. Whereas the previous movies operated on various levels to resonate with adults and entertain kids, this one is geared mainly toward younger audiences in ways that are frequently silly and insubstantial. Too often in the film from director Mike Mitchell (""Trolls,"" ""The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part"") and co-director Stephanie Ma Stine, the pacing is rushed, squandering the potential for tension or humor. A sight gag involving a literal bull in a China shop is a prime example: It zips by during a chase scene, without allowing us a moment to linger in the details. But in addition to a litany of uninspired puns, the main problem in the script from returning writers Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger and Darren Lemke (""Turbo,"" ""Shazam!"") is that the event that sets the plot in motion feels contrived. Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) tells Po (the ever-energetic Jack Black) that he must take over as spiritual leader of the valleywhich had been the late, legendary Master Oogway's responsibilityand hand off the day-in, day-out Dragon Warrior duties to a protege. Why now? He's only had the gig for a little while, and a hastily called audition montage barely registers. Besides, there's a more pressing threat, and it introduces us to a bunch of new characters voiced by an impressive array of actors. A shape-shifting sorceress known as the Chameleon (Viola Davis, formidable as always) wants to steal Po's Staff of Wisdom and use it to gather up the abilities of all the villains in the Spirit Realm. Yes, this does sound a lot like the dastardly intention of Kai, the supernatural bad guy voiced by J.K. Simmons in ""Kung Fu Panda 3."" To stop the Chameleon, Po reluctantly enlists the help of Zhen, a thieving fox who's knowledgeable about the outside world in ways that he isn't. She's voiced by Awkwafina in yet another wise-cracking sidekick role. It's a strength of hers and it can be amusing, but by now we've seen her play this kind of smart-alecky comic part way too many times, particularly in animated films, between ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Bad Guys"" and ""Raya and the Last Dragon."" As Po and Zhen travel to stop the Chameleon in a"
3,BBP_Doc4_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc4_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Negative,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"Po (Jack Black), the sad-clown-eyed, dude-speaking, dumpling-loving, dumpling-shaped whirling dervish of the ""Kung Fu Panda"" films, has a word to describe his favorite martial-arts move (the wuxi finger hold, executed with a raised pinkie). More than that, it describes the exalted state inside him as he executes it. The word is ""skadoosh."" Early on in ""Kung Fu Panda 4,"" Po is in the middle of a combat training moment when he asks, ""Where's the skadoosh?"" It's a meaningful question, because what he's really saying is: You can fight all you want, but without the skadoosh, what's the point? Watching ""Kung Fu Panda 4,"" a sequel that's probably going to make a Zen temple full of money, I kept thinking back to that moment. This genial fourth-chapter action fairy tale has all the things it's supposed to have, at least according to the blockbuster animation playbook: Po kicking butt between daydreams of doughy cuisine; a quirky fighting sidekick an androgynous-looking fox named Zhen, voiced by Awkwafina who spends the film trading barbs with him; box-checking encounters with Po's parents, Li Shan (Bryan Cranston) and Mr. Ping (James Hong), as well as his training guru, the ancient curmudgeon Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman); plus a supervillain who does all she can to take over the world. Yet as the movie unfolded, all I could think was, Where's the skadoosh? When the original ""Kung Fu Panda"" was released in 2008, it was built around a great joke: that Po, incarnated by Jack Black at his Jack Blackiest, was a lazy hipster goofball who just wanted to sit around yet somehow, through intense training (and the pursuit of his love of dumplings), he became the unlikeliest of kung fu masters. Two sequels (one good, one okay) and three let's-milk-the-franchise animated TV series later, Po is now an icon, a mascot, an action figure for every kid with the imagination of a superhero and the soul of a couch potato. But with all that overexposure, it isn't just the novelty that is now gone from Po's saga. So is the comic punch, the sense that he's on a journey that jolts him out of his torpor. The journey ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" places him on is retirement. As the film opens, he's trying to hawk his identity as the Dragon Warrior to open a tofu-and-noodle shop. This is a clear sign of decadence (almost a knowing metaphor for franchise cartoon burnout), which is why it seems fitting when Master Shifu informs him that it's time for Po to choose a successor and for Po himself to become the spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace. But Po doesn't want to be yesterday's dumpling. He's holding as iron a grip on his role as Joe Biden. Fate arrives in the form of the Chameleon, an empress sorceress who can shape-shift into anything she wants. You'd think the movie would have a mad ball with this, but Mike Mitchell, who directed the inspired ""Trolls,"" works no such magic"
4,BBP_Doc5_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc5_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Negative,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"Martial arts master panda Po returns to the big screen after an eight-year absence with Kung Fu Panda 4, a lacklustre sequel which is as colourful and energetic as its predecessors but lacks the sweet buoyancy that once made this franchise so fun. Jack Black is back to voice the endearing panda, who is coping with the fact that he must relinquish his warrior mantle just when a deadly new enemy makes her presence known. But there is little fresh about the character or his world any more, resulting in a sporadically amusing animated action-comedy without much kick. Kung Fu Panda 4 opens March 8 in the US, with a March 28 release planned for the UK. The 2016 Kung Fu Panda 3 grossed roughly $520m worldwide, followed by two streaming series, one on Prime Video and the other on Netflix. (Black lent his voice to the latter) Some of the star cast from previous cinematic instalments Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan are missing from the new film, although the arrival of new names, such as Awkwafina and Viola Davis, will add lustre. With few family pictures in the marketplace, Kung Fu Panda 4 should enjoy strong commercial returns. The original 2008 film provided Black with one of his signature roles; an irreverent, compassionate panda who discovers the greatness inside himself after he is forced to protect those he loves. Boasting dazzling animation and a fizzy combination of martial-arts action and slapstick comedy, Kung Fu Panda was a constant delight. Unfortunately, the sequels have struggled to maintain that magic, and this new chapter is especially laboured. Now long-celebrated as The Dragon Warrior, the kindly, heroic Po (Black) is concerned when his ageing mentor Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) advises him that it is time to ascend to his new role, that of Spiritual Leader Of The Valley Of Peace. But Po has no interest in a position in which he will not be able to show off his expert kung-fu moves, so it is almost a relief when he learns of the arrival of a mysterious adversary, The Chameleon (Davis), a shape-shifting sorceress who wants to rule the land. Assisted by a new friend, a crafty fox named Zhen (Awkwafina) who has dealt with The Chameleon before, Po prepares to do battle. Director Mike Mitchell (Trolls, The Lego Movie 2) and franchise writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (joined this time by Darren Lemke) have crafted a simplistic parable in which Po bonds with the sarcastic Zhen, an orphan who has trouble trusting others. (She is only working with Po in exchange for a shorter prison term after being arrested for stealing.) Po does not want to give up his title as Dragon Warrior, but Shifu insists he must choose a successor so, inevitably, Po will spend much of this sequel shirking his responsibility until, eventually, he comes to understand the importance of embracing change, no matter how difficult it might be. Those life lessons like everything"
5,BBP_Doc6_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc6_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Positive,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"Lovers of the big-screen movie experience, rejoice! In the past week we've been gifted with two count 'em, two pictures of breathtaking visual opulence. One, of course, is ""Dune: Part Two,"" currently playing in all its sandwormy splendor at multiplexes just about everywhere. The other is, unexpectedly, ""Kung Fu Panda 4."" ""Huh!"" you might say. A kiddie cartoon about a pudgy protagonist voiced by an especially excitable Jack Black? Believe it. Visual splendor is where you find it, and you'll find plenty of it here. Gloriously colorful landscapes, bustling cityscapes, deep-focus interiors, all on view, demanding to be seen on the biggest screens one can find. As is the case with ""Dune,"" tiny phones and laptops can't begin to do justice to what the filmmakers have conjured up. Leave the house, pay the parking, buy the popcorn, settle in and enjoy what movies at their best are truly all about. The fourth time is truly the charm in this long-running franchise. For its first return in eight years, directors Mike Mitchell and Stephanie Stine, a trio of credited screenwriters and a vast army of technical specialists have recalibrated the ""Panda"" format. They've reassigned Po's martial arts compatriots, the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane and Viper), to off-screen duties, briefly acknowledging their absence early in the movie. In their place, they've brought aboard a fox named Zhen. It's a good trade because said fox is voiced by the inimitable Awkwafina. Note to Hollywood: Cast her in every animated movie henceforth. She's one of the best features in a smallish role in ""Migration"" and she's an artful scene-stealer in ""Panda 4."" Credit writers Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger and Darren Lemke with her clever, snappy dialogue. Credit Awkwafina with her quick-lipped, humor-laden delivery. The character is a light-fingered thief who badgers, bothers and bewilders Po as the two of them venture forth to match wits and martial arts skills with a shape-shifting lizard villainess impressively, menacingly, voiced by the redoubtable Viola Davis. The character's split-second transformations are masterpieces of the animators' skills. From the genial, gluttonous doofus he played in the original ""Kung Fu Panda"" in 2008, Po has gradually graduated to more significant duties over the course of the movies, a battler for justice and a popular leader of critters in his home valley. Now his mentor-master, the red panda Master Shifu (again voiced by Dustin Hoffman), demands Po take the next step and become the Spiritual Leader in the Valley of Peace. That's not for him, he tells his master. He's a more grounded, gluttonous kind of guy. This, as usual, induces heartburn in the mentor. It's a conflicted relationship. Before he can graduate to the higher spiritual plane, Po has to recruit a replacement. Finagling her way into contention is Zhen. Prodded by Shifu, paired with Zhen, propelled cross-country to a city of sinful types (beware the teeny bunnies with bad attitudes and fearsome fangs), Po goes forth, battling often in impressively choreographed fight scenes. Armed with his unreliable"
6,BBP_Doc7_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc7_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Positive,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"Kung Fu Panda 4 finds our trusty, rotund hero Po at a career crossroads and he's nervous. ""Change doesn't have to be a bad thing,"" he is told. ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" also finds the franchise at an inflection point, but there's no reason for us to be nervous. DreamWorks knows what it's doing. The series' first new installment in eight years is a reliably funny, sweet and wonderfully realized passing of the torch, with a paw in the past and another into the future an elegant goodbye and a hello. Many other filmmakers ahem, Marvel and DC might learn a thing. When we meet him, Po voiced as always by a lively Jack Black is being asked to give up his dream role as Dragon Warrior and pick a successor. He's being kicked upstairs to be Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. (This is basically the Peter Principle illustrated in animation.) Except Po doesn't want to go into management. He loves smashing skulls and still has that lovable imposter syndrome he's had since the franchise began. He tries to short-circuit any succession plans, change being too frightening. A new enemy threatening an existential crisis offers a reprieve The Chameleon a wicked, powerful sorceress voiced by Viola Davis looks like the lizard from the GEICO commercials who spent too much time at Graceland. Po teams up with a new character a Corsac fox named Zhen voiced by Awkwafina who is an orphan-turned-thief and teaches the too-trusting panda to trust no one. The movie then becomes a buddy road movie as these two hunt The Chameleon and a chance to bundle their home and auto insurance. Wait a minute, you might be asking: Where are The Furious Five Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Crane and Mantis who have been in each ""Kung Fu Panda"" iteration so far? They're not really in ""Kung Fu Panda 4,"" but the film reaches back to the first installment to bring back the snow leopard, Tai Lung, voiced by the sonorous Ian McShane. Bryan Cranston is also back to voice Po's goofy biological father and James Hong returns as his spirited adoptive goose dad, while Dustin Hoffman reprises his role as eye-rolling master Shifu. It's a good balance of new and old characters but a masterstroke is coming: The Chameleon finds a way of accessing the spirit realm and bringing back every villain Po has ever faced. That results in a greatest hits-like fight scene that may be hard to top if there's a ""Kung Fu Panda 5."" The third installment's writers, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, are also back this time, joined by Darren Lemke. The film is helmed by ""The Lego Movie 2"" director Mike Mitchell and co-directed by Stephanie Ma Stine, who worked on ""Raya and the Last Dragon."" The last three movies have largely stuck to the rural Valley of Peace, so the filmmakers change it up this time and take Po and Zhen to an urban environment, Juniper City, packed with busy"
7,BBP_Doc8_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc8_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Positive,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"Over the course of three Kung Fu Panda movies, audiences have watched as Jack Black's lovable panda Po beat the odds and became the unstoppable force known as the Dragon Warrior. Now, eight years after the franchise appeared to end (at least on the big screen), Po is back in a new adventure that offers another, perhaps more satisfying endpoint to his story in Kung Fu Panda 4. Though following a familiar formula that's running the risk of wearing thin, this new sequel from director Mike Mitchell and co-director Stephanie Stine still finds some heart in the reliable DreamWorks franchise. Kung Fu Panda first began in 2008 and became a box office phenomenon that only grew with its sequel. However, Kung Fu Panda 3 saw some diminishing returns, and it remains to be seen how this new effort will fare. As someone who just binge-watched all three movies, I can confidently say that those who enjoyed Po's past adventures will find things to love about this one, even if it is lacking some beloved parts. Kung Fu Panda 4 starts off similarly to the previous movies, with one of Po's previous adversaries making a surprise return in an ominous prologue. By now, Po has fully embraced his role as the Valley of Peace's Dragon Warrior, and he's even got a new staff to highlight his elevated position. The movie picks up threads from Kung Fu Panda 3, specifically involving Po possessing the late Master Oogway's staff. As a result, Master Shifu (a returning Dustin Hoffman) informs Po he needs to pick someone to be the new Dragon Warrior so Po can become the Valley's spiritual leader. Unsurprisingly, Po is against the idea and actively avoids it by turning his focus to China's latest threat, the shape-shifting Chameleon (Viola Davis). Po begins Kung Fu Panda 4 with his typical irreverent personality fully intact. He's become more sure of himself when it comes to heroics, but when faced with greater responsibility, he deflects with jokes, much to Shifu's chagrin. It is somewhat exhausting to see Po refuse to grow, particularly after we've seen him learn time and again that he has to undergo some change. Kung Fu Panda 4 soon recovers and puts him on a path of genuine development, but it does suggest there isn't much further for this character to go. Luckily, Black hasn't missed a beat in voicing Po, throwing himself into the role once again with plenty of enthusiasm. His cover of Britney Spears' ""Baby One More Time"" in the credits is also not to be missed. As with the previous movies, Kung Fu Panda 4 has assembled an impressive voice cast. Po's friends and fellow warriors, the Furious Five, are conspicuously missing, and their absence is disappointing. Nevertheless, the movie tries its best to fill in the gaps. Returning characters Li (Bryan Cranston) and Ping (James Hong) get their own subplot, as Po's dads bond over their shared concern for his safety, and their heartwarming dynamic leads"
8,BBP_Doc9_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP_Doc9_Kung_Fu_Panda_4,BBP,Comedy,Positive,Kung_Fu_Panda_4,"While animated movie series can often fall prey to franchise bloat, Kung Fu Panda has remained consistently solid, despite running since 2008 and now featuring four movies, and far more television specials, short films, and television series than you're probably aware of. In a world full of possibilities, vibrant characters, and a sense of humor that rarely relies on pop culture or current trend jokes like most animated films, the Kung Fu Panda movies are always reliable fun. The last film in the franchise, 2016's Kung Fu Panda 3, felt like a decent conclusion for the adventures of Po (voiced by Jack Black), as he accepted his position and truly became the Dragon Warrior. With the third installment also rehashing some of the same ideas from the first two films, it felt like maybe it was time for Po and the Kung Fu Panda films to head into the sunset while it was still on top. But eight years later, Po returns with Kung Fu Panda 4 and proves that there's still plenty of juice left in these movies. It provides another fitting ending for this series, but also opens up the opportunity for a new beginning. Kung Fu Panda 4 begins with Po finally comfortable in his placement as the Dragon Warrior. While the rest of the Furious Five are off on their own adventures, Po is maintaining the peace and protecting those in need all on his own. This is why it comes as a shock when Po is told by Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) that it's time for Po to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace and that he must pick his replacement as the new Dragon Warrior. Given his newfound comfort in the position, Po is hesitant about losing the title he's worked so hard to achieve. Even with great potential replacements, Po is uninspired by his options. While Po is struggling with this decision, he encounters a fox named Zhen (Awkwafina) who is attempting to rob the temple. After putting her behind bars, Po learns of a new enemy known as The Chameleon (Viola Davis) who can shape-shift into anyone and is attempting to conjure villains from the past to steal their kung fu powers. When he discovers that Zhen might have information on how he can find The Chameleon, Po teams up with this fox. The unlikely pair must then try to stop this new power-stealing enemy. The Kung Fu Panda movies have always been about Po working with the ensemble of the Furious Five, and as the series continued, the supporting cast grew more important, even hinting that they'd be capable of handling their own plots. But if the rest of this series has been ensemble action films, Kung Fu Panda 4 moves away from that to turn this latest installment into a buddy film between Po and Zhen. Even though it may seem odd for these movies to move away from what was still working for them, it's a"

When you watch live-action movie series featuring your favorite stars over a period of many years, the actors at least have the grace to age along with their audiences. But the characters in animated movies tend to always look the same, as demonstrated by Po, the hero of Kung Fu Panda 4. As still delightfully voiced by Jack Black, he's exactly the same big, furry lug that he was in the original film, which came out in, gulp, 2008. Well, he's a little different. He's now been the Dragon Warrior for so long that his mentor, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman, sounding more gravelly than ever), orders him to relinquish his title and assume the role of Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. Po, who's preoccupied with starting his own noodle restaurant, resists at first, but ultimately complies with the directive that also requires him to find and train his successor. First, though, he has to deal with a new villain in the form of, at least some of the time, The Chameleon (Viola Davis, in her first animated voice turn), who, as her name indicates, has the ability to transform herself at will from a tiny lizard into any creature she chooses, including an elephant. The Chameleon is set on acquiring Po's Staff of Wisdom, which would enable her to bring back all of the evildoers whom Po had previously vanished in films 1-3. He winds up teaming up, buddy cop-movie style, with Zhen (Awkwafina), a crafty, thieving fox who promises to lead Po to The Chameleon. To do so, they'll have to leave the safe confines of the Valley of Peace and head to the wilds of Juniper City, where they instantly get into all forms of trouble, including a barroom brawl that provides the opportunity, one of many, for the filmmakers to deliver one of the kinetic animated fight sequences that have been the series' trademark since its inception and here reach dazzling new visual heights. Pursuing the pair are Po's adoptive, goose father Mr. Ping (James Hong) and real father Li (Bryan Cranston), who are prominently featured in this installment. Their bumbling interactions resembling the antics of a seasoned vaudevillian team, they provide many of the film's laughs, as when Li attempts to intimidate a group of lowlifes by announcing, ""I eat mahjong tiles for breakfast!""

And with what used to be called the family audience too, which, being translated, means more or less everybody. But does Shrek 2 deliver? The answer is a fairly resounding ""yes"". I say fairly resounding because, in truth, the story is much slimmer and I can't say the music is very memorable. But the animation by which it stands or falls is as brilliant as ever and, though it wouldn't really be right to call it totally anti-Disney, it certainly trumps that institution for sharpness of focus, notably as far as the screenplay is concerned. Considering Shrek 2 has been given a U certificate, it takes a few of the kind of risks that old Walt would never have countenanced. It's a bit of a mickey-take, particularly of celebrity, that might just go a bit above a few kids' heads, even though they may well giggle at a Pinocchio in ladies' underwear. Of course, you can't completely take the mickey out of celebrity and have a posse of big names doing the voices, but that's a minor detail. It helps to sell the picture and that's the main deal as we all know. There are all the old favourites hammering away at the soundtrack with funny voices, and some new ones too - notably Antonio Banderas as Puss-in-Boots, a feline hitman who hates everybody and has a splendid running gag that is too good to give away. But to the plot. And not an awful lot need be said about that. Shrek (Mike Myers), the amiable ogre whose green face does not speak of jealousy but an inexperience of life that would endear him to the waggiest labrador, is taken by Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), now a daintier ogre herself, to meet the parents in Far Far Away land, where there's a red carpet that reminds one of the Oscar ceremony and a castle that could be Las Vegas itself. They (Julie Andrews and John Cleese, a pairing that boggles the mind) are aghast at the match and what with a nasty Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), a camp Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and Puss-in-Boots, there's trouble in heaven. Naturally, Eddie Murphy's garrulous Donkey comes along for the ride and generally makes things worse trying to make them better. In the end love triumphs, but the film is never overly sentimental in the Disney tradition. It doesn't make you drop a tear, like Dumbo or Bambi. But it does make you laugh, and it assuredly makes you admire the animation which, though still unable to make the human faces seem other than plastic, invests the rest with so much character that you can only wonder at the efforts of the Dreamworks team. By the way, can anyone tell me the genesis of Mike Myers's accent? Is it Welsh or just double Dutch? No matter. This will run and run."

A key reason for this accomplishment is that so much of the talent of the original has returned to the new ""Shrek,"" including one of its directors (Andrew Adamson), two of its writers (Adamson and Joe Stillman) and all three of its vocal stars: Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and Mike Myers as Shrek, the ogre that walks like a man. These are people who know how to make the trains run on time, and run on time they do. The more anonymous heroes of ""Shrek 2"" are the teams of computer animators who make the story come alive on screen. There is something about the computer that seems to set animators free, that liberates their enthusiasm and enables them to come up with razzle-dazzle set pieces that are too clever to resist. Which is a good thing, because this ""Shrek"" is on the slow side getting started. While the film's initial exposition is necessary to set things up, it does feel like pro forma business that has to be gotten through before the animators can go wild. After an all-too-brief romantic interlude at Hansel's Honeymoon Hideaway, newlyweds Shrek and Fiona return home to the swamp only to be confronted with a pair of real-life problems: best friend Donkey's refusal to make himself scarce and an invitation from Fiona's folks, the King and Queen of Far Far Away, to Meet the Parents. Though he's a trial to the young marrieds, Eddie Murphy's irrepressible, impossible to discourage beast of burden is the opposite for audiences. As Fiona and Shrek gradually morph into romantic leads, Murphy's Donkey, at least initially, carries the comic burden, bringing the perfect reading to lines such as, ""How about a side of sugar for the steed?"" Less enthralling is the initial conflict-with-the-in-laws plot structure. Co-writer/co-director Adamson has said it was inspired by ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" and there is something of the plodding nature of that film in this one's initial exposition. Shrek and the King and Queen (Julie Andrews and John Cleese), who always thought their daughter would marry the photogenic Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), are less than enchanted by Fiona's choice of mate, and that leads to an equally predictable rift between husband and wife. Fortunately, ""Shrek 2"" has two new characters up its sleeve who liven things up considerably -- one a malicious, completely insincere fairy godmother (""Absolutely Fabulous' "" Jennifer Saunders) who's turned herself into a conglomerate on the Martha Stewart model but is never too busy to do good people an evil turn. Even better is Puss in Boots, wonderfully voiced by Antonio Banderas. He goes from Shrek's nemesis to his friend, from rascally assassin to cute kitty, arousing Donkey's jealousy in the process. ""The position"
12,CJM_Doc3_Shrek_2,CJM_Doc3_Shrek_2,CJM,Comedy,Positive,Shrek_2,"Unsurprisingly, your enjoyment of Shrek 2 will likely be predicated on your enjoyment of the first Shrek, although it's safe to say that DreamWorks' sequel will offend no one. As the film opens, big green ogre Shrek (Myers) and his new bride Fiona (Diaz) return from their honeymoon to their beloved swamp (where Murphy's endlessly annoying Donkey awaits, braying from boredom) to discover they've been invited to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents (Cleese, Andrews). Shrek, fearing that this is the type of set-up that usually ends with big green ogres such as himself being slaughtered by torch-bearing royal subjects, at first attempts to scuttle the visit, but ends up accompanying his bride, because, well, you've got to meet the parents sooner or later. Once there, the king and queen are taken aback by the fact that their daughter's husband is an ogre (much less their daughter, whom they had expected to see as the ravishing human she had been at the start of the first Shrek), and the scenes develop racial tensions (including a dining sequence that recalls Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?) that will be appreciated by parents and probably overlooked by their younger children. It's then that Fairy Godmother (Absoutely Fabulous' Saunders) arrives: As the schemingly dutiful mother of Prince Charming (Everett), who had been slated to marry Princess Fiona before Shrek entered the picture, she promptly hires a cute little furball of an assassin Puss-in-Boots (Banderas) to take out the offending husband. That lasts all of five minutes before the suave and honorable Puss switches his allegiance to Shrek, and, with Donkey, the trio sets off to snatch a potion from Fairy Godmother's factory that will turn Shrek into a handsome human. If the storyline seems cluttered, that's because it is and so was Shrek's but writers Adamson, Joe Stillman, J. David Stern, and David N. Weiss make the most of this continuing morality tale (as in the first film, the moral here is ""Be yourself"") and manage to take potshots at everything from Starbucks to Hollywood (which is nicely caricatured here by the precious, tony Kingdom of Far Far Away) while keeping the romance between the two lumpen leads in the forefront throughout. Myers, Diaz, and Murphy are all given some smart, snappy one-liners and gags, but it's the introduction of Banderas' Puss-in-Boots that comes as the freshest and sharpest (and most welcome) surprise. There are precious few actors who could have imbued the character with such an easy rapscallion charm, and Banderas has only to curl up the end of a line reading to net an easy laugh. Most interesting is the film's soundtrack, which has been upgraded from the previous outing's use of Top 40 popsters Smash Mouth and this time includes I kid you not Tom Waits, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, and the Buzzcocks (the latter is a cover version by Pete Yorn, fair enough, but still ...), which makes for some rousingly dark showstoppery.

Everyone who has ever tried it knows that marriage (official or un-) is the most dangerous adventure known to man- and womankind. Every year, millions attempt it, and millions of others flee from it in remorse and defeat. So while I suppose there are children out there who are excited about the prospect of ""Shrek 2,"" my hunch is that, by and large, it's really their parents who are brimming with curiosity about the fate of the cantankerously likable ogre Shrek and his new bride, Princess Fiona, now that the pair face the grim, thankless task of attempting to live happily ever after. Is it going too far out on a beanstalk to say that ""Shrek 2"" is one of the most mature movies about adult relationships ever made? At the very least, I think it's accurate to say that among movies aimed primarily at children, ""Shrek 2"" is redolent of a specifically adult wistfulness -- it's a happy picture, but one that's nonetheless aware of the sometimes uncomfortable stretching and contorting that two people have to endure when they attempt to build a life together. ""Shrek 2"" may also be the first animated feature about, among other things, the unpredictability of sexual attraction. If the message of the first ""Shrek"" was the wearisomely threadbare ""Real beauty is on the inside,"" the message of ""Shrek 2"" is the significantly more complicated ""You probably don't realize it, but the chubby, pimply kid who picks his nose in homeroom may quite possibly grow up to be much better in the sack, and a nicer guy, than the Troy Donahue look-alike everybody swoons over."" ""Shrek 2"" never suggests we should ignore good character in favor of animal attraction. But just as significantly, it acknowledges that people (and ogres) aren't just walking compendia of noble inner virtues. Looks do matter to us -- it's only when we get hung up on the conventions of good looks that we get into trouble. Fat or thin, conventionally pretty or not, flesh-toned or green: ""Shrek 2"" believes in the erotic possibilities of everyone. ""Shrek 2"" opens with the honeymoon of Shrek (voice provided by Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz): They've rented a gingerbread house by the sea, and they roll around on the shore, ""From Here to Eternity""-style, enjoying each other in a way that's NC-17 in spirit if not in explicitness. (""Shrek 2"" is, incidentally, rated a relatively chaste and child-friendly PG.) Shrek and Fiona share luxurious mud baths together, giggling cheerfully if one of them should pass gas. (Like its predecessor, ""Shrek 2"" has its share of fart and poo jokes; my favorite touch is the magic-potion bottle marked with the incongruous legend ""Toadstool Softener."") But Shrek and Fiona's fairy tale-honeymoon happiness can't last forever.

Mind you, it's called the kingdom of Far Far Away, but from the billboard-size letters on a hillside spelling out its name to its Rodeo Drive-like shopping district and palm-tree-lined streets, the computer-animated locale can be nothing other than a fairy-tale version of Tinseltown (if that's not redundant). Which makes perfect sense, given the nearly nonstop barrage of inside-jokey references to ""From Here to Eternity,"" ""Alien,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""Spider-Man,"" ""King Kong,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""The Mask of Zorro,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the TV show ""Cops,"" the Oscar telecast and about a thousand other references to La-La Land I didn't have time to write down. Why would I want to spend the whole movie with my nose buried in a note pad? I might have missed a laugh. As with ""The Simpsons,"" another gold mine of knowingly self-referential humor prized for its high-volume use of evanescent sight gags that whiz by in the background, ""Shrek 2"" seems made for repeat viewings on video or DVD. The gags fly past so fast and furious here that it's impossible to catch them all without a pause button. Picking up where ""Shrek"" left off, our story begins with the honeymoon of ogre Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), she having been only recently rescued from a dragon-guarded castle by the Green-Skinned One. It isn't long after eloping, however, that the newlyweds are invited by her parents, the King and Queen of Far Far Away (John Cleese and Julie Andrews), for a visit. Now, this may seem strange, given that it was Mummy and Daddy who locked Fiona away in a castle to begin with. This was their somewhat medieval solution to the curse that had turned her into a hag each night after sunset. Despite this, they're not, pardon the expression, ogres. Nevertheless, Fiona's folks are more than a bit disappointed in their daughter's choice of husband, having hoped that the vain, Brad Pitt-like Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) might have been the one to sweep their little girl off her feet and break the spell. Turns out, though, Charming was a little late getting to Fiona, who is now stuck, 24-7, with skin as green as Shrek's. Tensions, needless to say, run high during these awkward, ""Meet the Parents"" moments. So high, in fact, that the King hires a killer named Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to off his son-in-law, even as Shrek runs away seeking assistance from Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) in a mission to find a spell that will make himself more lovable.

Bring it on.' Well, they finally did, and a very strange affair it is. A couple of weeks after the original Shrek, my four-year-old turned five and announced that she wanted a Shrek party. No problem, we said mainly because when a kid wants a theme party you drive to the store and load up with Shrek cups, Shrek plates, Shrek hats, Shrek balloons, Shrek streamers, the whole lot costing, oh, a buck ninety-eight tops. Or, alternatively, Harry Potter cups, plates, hats. Or Finding Nemo. Whatever movie you dig. If you want your kid to have a Michael Moore party, they've got Fahrenheit 9111 plastic cups with Halliburton 'pipeline' straws and no one gets a slice of the cake because it's all been creamed off by Dick Cheney and the Saudis in a secret deal signed in Riyadh in 1979. But when we got to the store there was no Shrek stuff and no plans to release any for months. So, with the kid threatening to sue for emotional distress, we wound up having to make our own Drearnworks merchandising, with the missus staying up overnight baking the big Shrek cake, doing a big Shrek pinata, taking plain balloons and painting Donkey and Princess Fiona on them, etc. Three years on, the stores are full of Shrek 2 tie-ins, but my sense is despite a boffo opening weekend in America the movie leaves youngsters a little cold. We begin where we left off. Shrek the trumpet-eared green ogre (voiced by Mike Myers in his marvellous whiny Scots) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz. sounding a bit half-hearted and contractually obligated) have wed and returned to the swamp. Meanwhile, Prince Charming (voiced by Rupert Everett) has got to the castle where she was being held and broken into her tower to deliver the kiss that will restore her to life, only to find that when he got there the boudoir was bare. In the land of Far Far Away, King Harold (John Cleese, trying hard not to sound too John Cleeselike) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews, clear as a bell) assume that their beloved daughter Fiona is now married to a dashing prince and so invite the newlyweds to a big bash at their palace. Shrek suggests their Majesties will have trouble accepting Fiona now that she's a jolly green ogress. But Fiona assures him that her parents aren't like that, and off they set. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) comes along for the ride. His own missus, the Dragon, is nowhere in sight. Donkey explains that they're 'having problems'. Is this a motion-picture first? An animated character who refuses to do the sequel? Apparently so. Dragon's a no-show for the rest of the movie.

The filmmakers (three directors and three screenwriters) ladle the sentiment onto ogre couple Shrek (Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) as their love faces the challenges of a disapproving world, but reversing the ""happily-ever-after"" paradigm isn't the same thing as challenging it. Shrek's alternative fairy-tale world, where the Three Little Pigs trade snappy one-liners with the Three Blind Mice, is built out of spare pop-cultural parts that never cohere into a profound vision, so Shrek 2 seems a bibliographical addendum to the first film's worn-out conceptual thesis, the cinematic equivalent of elementary school kids playing ""Opposite Day."" The film's biggest sin, aside from a thuddingly rote locale (the kingdom of Far Far Away, a faux-satirical visualization ofgaspHollywood), is the shameful waste of its varied vocal talents. Taking the most obvious casting approaches, the filmmakers reveal an ignorant superficiality and general contempt of character. Myers and Diaz, he of the Scottish burr, she of the Charlie's Angel retro-feminist whine, go through the ""love-means-never-having-to-say-you're-sorry"" motions. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas play the second-tier sidekicks Donkey and Puss-in-Boots, respectively, with appropriate gusto, though they're undercut by constant rib-nudging jests of race-appropriate minstrelsy (the ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" production number is a gag way past its time and deeply offensive to boot.) As Fiona's parents Queen Lillian and King Harold, Julie Andrews and John Cleese contribute their always-welcome Brit sensibilities to sadly hollow misconceptionsrespectively, a dull mother/mentor figure by way of The Princess Diaries and a babbling simpleton given to off-putting bouts of bug-eyed mugging. The villainous Fairy Godmother, meanwhile, provides Jennifer Saunders another opportunity to revisit her hedonistic Ab Fab role, though it's noticeably tempered for fear of encouraging the kiddies to drink and do drugs. Perhaps most tragic is Rupert Everett's vainglorious Prince Charming, a character of less-than-singular dimension who cruelly exists to not get the girl, thus further enclosing another openly gay actor within a restrictive Hollywood box. Under the guise of tolerance, Shrek's corporate-minded creators engage in a dangerous form of double-speak, promoting a love-the-sinner/hate-the-sin dichotomy in which two jolly-green ogres are ideal role models of love, while a fey blond prince and transsexual Ugly Stepsister (Larry King) are discomforting, slapstick figures of fun. No less than the butt-ugly animated version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Shrek 2 continues its predecessor's facile race and gender thematics while stubbornly playing to the rabble in the pit."

Here's what you'd get in return: Ninety percent of the cards would be blank. Of the remaining 10 percent, no card would agree with any other card. That's the dreary reality of this sequel to the wondrous ""Shrek"" of three years ago: a piecemeal plot that seems to go nowhere and be about nothing and wind up no place, somewhat effectively camouflaged by a number of intriguing but incidental bits. Oh, it looks great. The pixies of pixelism at DreamWorks Animation know their stuff and can conjure up anything imaginable. The forms of the creatures are sinuous and convincing, their movements dynamic and frequently witty. The landscapes boast that eerie blend of the mythically resonant and palpable, as if distilled from N.C. Wyeth's id. The dwellings and urban landscapes are devilishly clever. The new breakthrough seems to be skin blemishes and whiskers, because the beings, human and mythic, have conspicuously reality-TV skin instead of that dead luster that seems endemic to the computer-generated world. So yes, Mr. and Mrs. America, in accordance with your wishes, the geniuses at DreamWorks can now give you animated acne! The story -- hmm, well, let's see, where to begin, how to proceed, where to end? Since the filmmakers botched all of these, why should anyone expect me to be able to bring this off? As best as I can figure out, there is no overarching, overall, ultimately satisfying story in the global sense. There's certainly nothing like the quest-structure of redemption through rescue that energized the first film, to say nothing of 7,908,987,098,765,887 or so stories before it. Rather, throughout, ""Shrek 2's"" plot patterns are engineered along a single model, the arbitrary emplacement of a minor obstacle to be overcome in about a 10-minute sequence. At that point, equally arbitrarily, a new minor obstacle is created, then overcome in 10 more minutes, and so forth for 90 minutes or so. When you get there, there's no there there, and there never was a there there, so you wonder: Why did we just go there? The movie is at least a pure sequel, following immediately upon the completion of what preceded it. It seems that upon waking up on the first night of their honeymoon, our favorite ogres, the just-married Mr. and Mrs. Shrek -- the former Princess Fiona, voiced in a lackluster performance by Cameron Diaz -- are invited -- commanded, that is, by royal decree -- to go to her parents' castle in Far Far Away Land for a wedding ball in their honor. The royal parents (the voices belong to John Cleese, unrecognizable, and Julie Andrews, so recognizable you wait for her to burst into ""The Sound of Music,"" which, incidentally, would have been preferable to any of the tunes the movie itself offers) are horrified to discover that their new son-in-law is"

As is customary during the summer movie season, this second go-round is a slightly brasher, more hyperactive photocopy of its source material that slavishly replicates the first film's delights while avoiding any alterations that might threaten to alienate even a single fan. Competent, inoffensive, and frustratingly familiar, it's a mild retread that, for good or bad (depending on how you felt about the original adventure), never strays from its Brothers Grimm-meets-Access Hollywood jambalaya template. Now living happily ever after, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are summoned by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to celebrate their daughter's nuptials in the land of Far, Far Away. The problem, though, is that Fiona's mom and pop think she's betrothed to Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) son of the mercenary Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), and the dashing hero who was supposed to break Fiona's ogre spell with a single kiss and don't react too kindly to their new son-in-law's big, green, monstrous exterior. Since Far, Far Away is a hokey fantasy version of Hollywood, we get rampant allusions to films such as Alien, Austin Powers, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as general nods to the ubiquitousness of Starbucks (here dubbed Farbucks), Joan Rivers' red-carpet shrieking, and the TV show Cops. The cumulative effect of all this name-dropping, however, is that Shrek 2 comes across like an egotistical know-it-all flaunting an encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture, with random, easily recognizable asides about Ghostbusters, Mission: Impossible and Justin Timberlake (Diaz's current boyfriend, no less!) included to make the audience feel like they're in on the (excruciatingly obvious) joke. Whereas Pixar's infinitely superior Toy Story and Finding Nemo eschew cheap scatological silliness in favor of incisive wit, Shrek 2 continues the franchise's penchant for wallowing in a morass of manure-related gags. Nothing wrong with some well-timed toilet humor, mind you, but having characters periodically interrupt scenes with arbitrary blasts of flatulence reeks of comedic desperation and further sullies the recycled narrative's moral about embracing one's inner beauty. Antonio Banderas' cute and cuddly assassin Puss In Boots a knowing riff on the star's dashing performance in 1998's The Mask of Zorro exhibits a swashbuckling mischievousness, and the feisty orange feline's vibrant animation is a testament to the film's dazzling coloring-book visual palette. Yet watching Puss cough up a furball and, later, lick himself in public just serves to remind one that underneath Shrek 2's surface splendor lurks a penchant for potty-mouthed puerility."

Three years later, whatever was fresh about Shrek is now gone. The new sequel, Shrek 2, gives the impression that its team of writers woke up everyday in Hollywood, drove to someplace else in Hollywood, and wrote about their experiences in Hollywood. Shrek 2 lacks any awareness of the outside world, fairy tales and children's stories included. None of the jokes stand on their own as jokes; they depend on the usual boys' bathroom humor and on pop culture references that range from a bit outdated to very outdated. How many people even today will get the reference to ""fine Corinthian leather"" for example? Younger audience members, and certainly future generations, will wonder what this film was supposed to be about. Shrek (voiced with a still-unexplained Scottish accent by Mike Myers) and Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) have just enjoyed their honeymoon -- a montage of images and references from other movies -- and returned home to find Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) living in their swamp home. A messenger arrives inviting the happy couple to visit Fiona's parents (voiced by John Cleese and Julie Andrews), the King and Queen of Far, Far Away. Of course, Far, Far Away is merely Los Angeles -- complete with silly movie posters and Starbucks-like coffee houses -- dressed up as an animated wonderland. The movie's dubious climax even takes place at a red-carpet premiere-like party with ""celebrities"" arriving and an announcer yapping about their clothes and status. When the king and queen's daughter arrives and she turns out to be an ogre, awkwardness sets in. The film could have done something interesting with this Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? premise, but instead it goes off in a hundred different directions, trying for lame jokes and winding up with a hackneyed plot. Myers doesn't even get to do anything funny here; he's the straight man. As Shrek wanders through the story taking beautification potions and trying to get back to Fiona by a certain time, most of his dialogue consists of mournful whining: ""if only"" this and ""maybe I should"" that. Fortunately, Antonio Banderas has joined the cast as Puss In Boots, an assassin hired to kill Shrek, who winds up joining him for no discernable reason. Aside from the expected ""coughing-up-hairballs"" and ""licking-his-privates"" jokes, Banderas manages to imbue the feline with a unique personality. His greatest trick is to subdue his enemies with his big, sorrowful kitten eyes. If we have to endure yet another sequel, I would prefer Puss get his own film. Meanwhile, even though they scrimped with their bargain basement script, directors Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon have spared no expense in making the film look spectacular, and it does.

He argued that good taste was ""asserted purely negatively, by the refusal of other tastes."" After one scrapes away the abject horror and disgust experienced in a visceral or ideologically negative reaction, the remainder must be the product of good taste. But only the offended tastebuds of a distinct, mostly bourgeois group implant the good taste canon, according to Bourdieu, and thus, these so-called elites draw the acceptable boundaries of mainstream culture. Cult films rally against good taste, defying the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural elitism of tastemakers. Such bad taste fare transgresses the conventional consciousness and dominant ideology. And there once was a time, established in the 1920s with the emergence of Classical Hollywood and lasting through the early 1960s, when a prevailing cultural outlook permeated the cinema. From the 1960s until the dawn of the Digital Age, cult films could still be transgressive in the face of a perceived uniformity in American culture. But as the overall culture continues to fragment and cults progress into subcultures, which in turn become entirely independent of one another, cult film has transformed into a commercially proven and exploitable market for cult-style entertainment today. As a result of this transformation, The Toxic Avenger, released in 1984 by Troma Entertainment, seems almost cute today. Bringing up French sociology and the fragmentation of cultural values in relation to The Toxic Avenger is not meant to suggest any feeling of loss or regret over the near eradication of the elitism of good taste in contemporary times. In an effort to preserve itself, the social hierarchy of good taste throughout history has suppressed countless artists from expressing themselves openly, forcing them into cult modes of exhibition. Rather, my initial remarks are meant to deplore the normalization and commercialization of transgressiveness in cinema. Antiauthoritarian cultists have become so commonplace that they have transformed into subcultures able to inhabit entirely different spaces without overlap, whether they exist online or in the real world. Their autonomy dissolves the oppositional relationship of good and bad taste, which has both positive and negative effects. On the positive end, it grants the creators of transgressive art a wider audience that supports it both financially, in terms of establishing a reliable marketplace for their works, and existentially, in that their audience has been demarcated by midnight madness screenings, web forums, and countless other subcultural sites. On the negative end, the institutionalization of cult films in pop-culture has robbed them of their potency, rebellion, and essential alternativenesscult films have become just another option on the search bar. the-toxic-avengerIn a way, my belief in the death of truly transgressive cult cinema began with The Toxic Avenger, as evidenced in the movie's modest franchise success.

The Troma Company can be proud to have had the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Costner and the actress Marisa Tomei as early rising stars on their books, and with over 165 movies, to date, to their name, Troma Entertainment has become very entertaining indeed. With a strong zest for independence, shock, black comedy, sex and with a youthful cast, these movies have become cult figures that certainly deserve the recognition and respect amongst their peers and fans alike. As with their biggest hit, The Toxic Avenger is a clever filming of parody and sardonic humour. Is The Toxic Avenger a social comment on the narcissistic and materialistic and bigotry ways of Western society or just a plain horror movie parody reflecting on how society should be more tolerant to difference? This is the story of Melvin, the Tromaville Health Club mop boy, who inadvertently and naively trusts the hedonistic, contemptuous and vain health club members, to the point of accidentally ending up in a vat of toxic waste. The devastating results then have a transmogrification effect, his alter ego is released, and the Toxic Avenger is born, to deadly and comical results. The local mop boy is now the local Superhero, the saviour of corruption, thuggish bullies and indifference. There has been a lot of hard work put into these movies special effects, for a movie of this genre, it has worked very well. With the extremely visual talents of Jennifer Aspinall, she has made this movie virtually her own, her numerous Award winning flair on special makeup effects is astounding. There is also her movie pedigree to reflect on too, such as Spookies (1987), Street Trash (1987), the Saturday Night Live and ""Mad TV"" television shows, The Mexican (2001), Ticker (2001) and A Cinderella Story (2004) and others. Apart from the well thought out stunt fights, car chases, clever make up and witty script, The Toxic Avenger is, down to base level, a very funny movie, this has, no doubt, been used as a stepping stone to greater things for some here. The humorous gags, the amateurish acting, the experience in front of the camera, as well as behind, have most definitely not been a (toxic) waste. Seeing is believing, and believe it when you see it.

Then along came The Toxic Avenger,an amazing and over the top Horror Comedy Action Superhero film that became a Cult Classic that put Troma entertainment on the map and also spawning three sequels,a children's Cartoon series,a stage musical and gave movie audiences one of the most beloved Superheros of all time in The Toxic Avenger. In other words,Troma was the studio The Toxic Avenger built. The Toxic Avenger is a classic Horror Comedy,a great film and one of the goriest,bloodiest and most politically incorrect films of all time and is so depraved and twisted that I don't a major studio then and now would have made The Toxic Avenger the way it is. Only s company like Troma entertainment would have the guts to make film this way. The Comedy in The Toxic Avenger is hilarious,wild and over the top thanks to the characters and situations that happen in the movie and you as a viewer will be in tears laughing while at the same time being disgusted at some of the things you see which I think adds to the appeal and so bad it's good style of The Toxic Avenger. What also makes TTA so funny and over the top is the way the film tackles subjects in a offbeat style such as violence,sex,corrupt politicians,Gym Clubs,toxic waste dumping,criminals,drug use and more. No subject in this film is left untouched. While TTA is a Horror film the Horror doesn't come from the movie being scary because it's not,the Horror comes from the amounts of violence and gore that happens in the film. The blood and gore while not very serious and at times funny the gore is not for the weak at heart because the blood and gore comes fast and quick. For a movie that was made on a small budget,TTA has some really great and exciting Action and fight scenes that are thrilling and well executed while being played for laughs. There is also a terrific car chase scene that will remind viewers viewers of"

So many points for someone on a bike, so many points for an elderly person, and big points for a small child. ""How many points for a child on a bike?"" asks the driver, excited. Learning this will earn him maximum points, he proceeds to knock the small child off his bike, and he goes flying over the hood. They turn round and see the child move in pain. Horrified that he may lose out on his points, the driver then proceeds to reverse over the child's head, squashing it completely. Two girls get out of the car and take some pictures. This scene, for me, represents the majority of this film. More shocking than it should be, even today, but never taking itself at all too seriously, regardless of the horror on show. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a skinny, nerdy loser who works in the swimming baths, forever cleaning up with his mop. He is frequently bullied and humiliated by a high school gang who one day play a trick on him, which sees him kissing a goat dressed in a tutu. Horrified, Melvin flees and throws himself through a window, landing on a conveniently positioned (and open-topped) barrel of toxic waste. He begins to burn and rot, and eventually the toxic waste causes him to mutate in a taller, stronger, and ultimately more heroic beast, who wants revenge on his tormentors. Toxie (as he is now called, played by man-mountain Mitch Cohen) starts to clean up the city of Tromaville, which is being run by corrupt mayor Peter Belgoody (Pay Ryan), while at the same time romancing blind girl Sara (Andree Maranda) who he rescues from a rapist in a restaurant. This was Troma's first big hit, and also their first foray into horror, having previously focusing on really crap sex comedies. After this, which after an initial unsuccessful run became a popular cult favourite on the B-movie circuit, they focuses only on horrors. This is the second Troma film I've seen. The other was Killer Nerd. You can probably assume from the title that it is a god-awful excuse for a film, although it is quite amusing in it's filmed-on-video awfulness (starring Harvey Pekar associate Toby Radloff). This, I'm pleased to say, was actually good! It was a hell of a lot more violent than I was expecting, and the special effects are actually pretty impressive in some places. And Toxie proves to be a likable vigilante/superhero, however hideous he may be. Having said that, this is a low-budget Troma, and it's not exactly Citizen Kane. The acting is wooden, and the film is so 80's you can practically reach out and feel the sweatbands and mullets. But it is funny, satisfyingly gory, and, most importantly, fun. Toxie proves to be a more interesting 'superhero' than the majority of others. And the"

But like anything else, there's always sublevels to these groups which can be broken down even further into their own genres. These genres are not the ones people either readily know about, have access to or is spoken of. An example of this are films produced from ""The Asylum"". Their reputation has become known for either making cheap knock offs or making cheap sequels to popular mainstream blockbusters. There are people who actively invest their time into those films. The same could be said for films made by Lloyd Kaufman under the Troma Entertainment banner. In a way, it's just another acquired taste like the previous company mentioned earlier. And although Kaufman was directing films a decade or so before this movie, it was this that got people's attention. The story written by Kaufman and Joe Ritter in his first credit is about the fictional town of tromaville located on the outskirts of New York. The town is filled with polar opposite citizens; those who have common sense and others who literally do the most absurd things no reasonably sane person would ever do. Among them all is Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl), a loser pool boy at the local health club. He's by no means socially equipped to navigate through such an environment and is easily bullied. One day after a group psychotic adults play a practical joke exposing him to toxic waste, he transforms into The Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) and voiced by Kenneth Kessler. Now having superhero strength, Melvin takes it upon himself to rid the evil in his town of Tromaville. The film was also directed by Kaufman and Michael Herz, who collaborated with Kaufman on a few previous projects. What works in the movie's favor is the tone audiences will experience from the execution. It's a simple plot about a discarded protagonist whose misfortune seen to others, turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to him. While out on his crusade Melvin crosses paths with a blind girl named Sara (Andree Maranda) and soon develops a connection. Its cliche but seeing the protagonist earn the respect from someone is something anyone would want. Does that mean the acting and characters well rounded? Absolutely not. Except for Melvin and Sara, no other character has redeeming qualities or resembles that of any regular human being. The way the actors play them and the way they're written are bizarre caricatures of what someone having no idea how a real person would behave. It's very strange to watch but that's partially the appeal because it is so out there. Of the adults that badger Melvin, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist) are the women of the group who have the most reprehensible interests. Topping it off though are their partners beating up grannies in the street who are rightfully named Slug (Robert Prichard) and Bozo (Gary Schneider). How"

I didn't see this film until I lot latter when I was a teenager about 16 and I'll admit it blew me away it wasn't entirely what I was expecting but that what made it all the better as it was outrageously fun and funny; watching it now as an adult is even more fun and funner than before. It's also one of the films that actually inspired me, yes I'm not kidding in writing and getting into the entertainment business. This film to me really turned things on their head let alone turned up the notch on violence, effects, comidy, and the superhero genere up to 11. The content and wild expressionism in this film wasn't common place at the time, it was defenantly before some of the TV shows ""South Park"", ""The Simpsons"" which are just as nuts, and that's part of what made the film great for me because it wasn't afraid of being what it wanted fun while doing what it wanted. This film was made on a low budget but I felt it was money well spent just showing that you can still make a good fun film despite limitations; as opposed to most big budget film where some tend to disappoint because they forgot one curcial element fun. The music is great it's one of my favorate movie soundtracks I really like the song ""Body Talk"" which is a catchy tune and a fun one to use if you ever want to do aerobics or fitness training. This film of course were in it for the action and comidy and like any well done floor it shines on both. The comidy is great the whole thing plays out like a live action Mad Magazine cartoon, it's rich in both verbal and visual humor. I also feel has a bit of replay value because sometimes watching this again I can pick up on more jokes that might have flied over me. The characters are fun, everyone in Tromaville are kinda live action Mad Magazine characters because not everyone is totally normal there is always something unusal about them or are just crazy. From villain despite unlikeable which is the point their still funny, like Cigarface as well as the two health club bullies Slug and Bozo whom are all true to their names, let alone the fact Bozo has got some real impulse problems as he gets easily stressed and angry over the smallest or stupidest thing, it cracks me up whenever he blows up. And Toxic/Melvin whom is a soild superhero. I really love the makeup design on him where he's ugly but actually plesent looking. The voice is great as it perfectly fits whom he is strong and authoritative, but also"
26,CMT_Doc7_The_Toxic_Avenger,CMT_Doc7_The_Toxic_Avenger,CMT,Horror,Positive,The_Toxic_Avenger,"This Troma film, a piece of symphatetic and not uninteresting trash by veterans Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, THE TOXIC AVENGER (USA, 1985) turned out to be even funnier and genuinely more clever little film as I re-watched it last night on the wonderful Tox Box DVD set released by Troma (including all three films in director's cut versions!) First of all, I admire the speed the directors manage to maintain throughout the film, minutes just pass by without even thinking about it which is definitely not always the case with B films. The characters are very noisy and irritating most of the time, but that fits to the own world of the film, the Tromaville, and thus doesn't feel annoying anymore. I think this is something many other trash films have never achieved, for example the awful 2002 film THE HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES by musician Rob Zombie, whose film tries to be funny (the characters laugh at their own jokes all the time etc.) but doesn't manage to create an interesting or original world of its own at all - and that's why the idiotic characters and neverending talking/screaming starts to feel very irritating. Unlike THE TOXIC AVENGER, Zombie's film leaves nothing to the viewer's brain. Especially like the German expressionist piece and cinematically breathtaking achievement DAS CABINET DES DR. CALIGARI by Robert Wiene, the Troma film has created a wild and wonderful world in which the unusually wild and excessively behaving and reacting (face expressions and other representations of one's feelings) characters fit perfectly. Also, THE TOXIC AVENGER has some satiric elements in it, mostly towards the youth in general with its desperate searches for a stronger identity, usually at the expense of the weaker and ""uglier."" The actors are all great. The scene in which a mother of some brat is ""washed"" in a very unusual manner strenghtens the mentioned interpretation about the youth even more. The film manages to point out some errors and negative sides of the society with black humor and dares also to show the flag in a little different (and more realistic, as any other flag on Earth) light than, for example, Michael Bay which is great, too. Of course the film is also full of sex, women's breasts and ultra violence not to speak of awful editing and continuity errors but they kind of add to the unique and over-energetic world of the film. The best thing here is that the makers knew what they were doing - outrageous trash - they knew that the film won't be appreciated by the Academy, for example, but they also knew that despite those facts and ""authorities"", their film can have many themes and ideas, even more than those that get golden statues. My greetings to the lunatics at Tromaville!"
27,CMT_Doc8_The_Toxic_Avenger,CMT_Doc8_The_Toxic_Avenger,CMT,Horror,Negative,The_Toxic_Avenger,"I have to force myself not to give this movie anything lower than a 5/10, though I'm very tempted to. The reason I'm forcing myself not to be so pessimistic is because I respect this movie a lot more than I liked it. Why? Because there is absolutely nothing here that is more off-the-wall than ""serious"" (aka: cheesy) horror films from the general time period, but The Toxic Avenger is a comedy rather than a ""serious"" horror film. And quite honestly, I've never seen very many horror-comedies that were actually funny, but The Toxic Avenger IS actually funny. Almost going hand-in-hand, the pure audacity this movie has makes every other horror release in its time look downright PG. The gore took the politically incorrect spin to a new level in the '80s, and without The Toxic Avenger I simply don't know if the uber-violent movies of today would even exist. It took things to a new level. It TRIED to offend people, for the first time since the birth of the horror film. Even today, I can't name very many movies that have this much audacity. For that I respect The Toxic Avenger. But, maybe it's just a matter of taste, I just didn't see this movie as very entertaining. I think it's one of those movies you had to grow up on as a kid to love as an adult, because I just didn't see a whole lot in it in 2008. I guess this is because I've seen countless imitators and rip-offs that I'm desensitized to what was a very original idea in '85. I don't know. I just didn't find as much entertainment value in it as I thought I would. On a technical level, the movie accomplishes the mess that it tries to accomplish. The music is catchy and sometimes funny. Some of the plot points are laugh-out-loud awesome. The gore effects and amount of gore are both nothing compared to those of today, but follow suit with the so-bad-it's-good feel. Everything reeks of '80s, and why shouldn't it? The Toxic Avenger isn't a timeless movie: it was made for one generation, and other generations typically won't get it the way those in the '80s got it. It's like a car, it depreciates in value as soon as it's released. It's never the same as it was when it first came out to a modern mind, because we've seen the aftereffects of it's original release (such as rip-offs, sequels, etc.). With all of that said, I just have a hard time finding anything at all WRONG with The Toxic Avenger. I just didn't find it entertaining like I thought I would. It's a definitive watch for any horror buff, or any movie buff in general. Maybe you'll find something entertaining that I didn't."
28,CMT_Doc9_The_Toxic_Avenger,CMT_Doc9_The_Toxic_Avenger,CMT,Horror,Negative,The_Toxic_Avenger,"I can say the most positive thing about The Toxic Avenger is that it knew what it was. Sure, it's a horrible, horrible, incredibly bad film, but at least unlike other top worst movies of all time, this one knew it was meant for B-Movie status. Or at least for some midnight views or drinking games. For someone who has not seen a singe ""Troma"" film ever, until last night, I was pretty shocked on the lengths these directors and writers went. From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face. I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off. Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity. Yeah, I mentioned some of the movie was fun. It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs. (Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.) I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie. Nerdy, nerd, nerd Melvin's the janitor in charge of the mop at a gym and is getting picked on. Why? Because he's misunderstood? No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team. And he should honestly never be let out of his house for his own safety. At any rate, he sort of works by mopping and goggling the bimbos until a plan is hatched to rid the gym of this eye sore by humiliation that turns into him leaping out of a window into, you guessed it, toxic waste. From there, this Frankenstein's Monster with a brand new voice and body seeks out justice for whatever reason you can think of. But, this is not a Batman vigilante. This one not only has no conscious of murder, he slaughters. I could say this is where the movie gets silly, but that was from frame one. No, this is where is where the movie gets sick and turns more horror. Sure, there are more comedic, intentional or not, moments, but they layered on the gore and violence and some of the oddest characters lifted right from Garbage Pail Kids cards, and no, I'm not talking about mutated characters. These were the humans. I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone other than the midnight-movie, drinking (or other forms of controlled substance) or lovers of bad movie groups. I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing."

A narration informs us that 'New York City, the worlds capital of culture & industry. Here, among the towering skyscraper's, civilisation is guided by men of progress & the wonders of technology. But for all this industrial advancement there is a price to pay. Pollution, the unavoidable byproduct of todays society, every year millions of gallons of poisonous wastes, garbage & radioactive chemicals are disposed of in nearby towns such as Tromaville the toxic waste dumping capital of the world. Our story takes place at the Tromaville health club where a young man named Melvin Furd (forget what the IMDb says, it's definitely Furd not Junko) works. Melvin's entire life, in fact entire being was changed by toxic chemical waste...' Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a real loser, nerd & all round wimp. Melvin is a mop boy at the the Tromaville health club & everyone makes fun of him, especially four local thugs named Bozo (Gary Schneider) his girlfriend Julie (Cindy Manion) plus Slug (Robert Prichard) & his girlfriend Wanda (Jennifer Prichard as Jennifer Babtist). One day the four decide to play a cruel practical joke on Melvin & humiliate him in front of as many people as possible. However things go wrong, or right depending on whichever way you look at it I suppose, & Melvin ends up head first in a barrel of hazardous toxic waste. As a consequence Melvin mutates into the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen as Mitchell Cohen), wow.

Directed by Micheal Herz & Lloyd Kaufman as Samuel Weil I thought The Toxic Avenger was one seriously brain-dead film made for idiots by idiots, you can take that anyway you like considering that I actually quite liked it. The script by Joe Ritter is as stupid as you can imagine, this thing makes the Police Academy films (1984 - 94) look like the pinnacle of sophistication! The jokes are really dumb & moronic, furthermore it stretches the boundaries of acceptability & taste.

Suddenly, this largely unknown actor, whose only significant credits were a part in Saving Private Ryan and some voice work in The Iron Giant (as the title character), is a hot commodity with significant roles in two films opening the same day. Diesel fans are strongly advised to see both Boiler Room and Pitch Black, as they show different aspects of the actor's range. In Boiler Room, he's a regular guy working a regular job. In Pitch Black, he goes into full Arnold Schwarzenegger mode, flexing his muscles, grunting, and uttering the occasional one liner. It's not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb. Pitch Black can be viewed as a slick, stylish version of the kind of outer space creature feature that is typified best by the Alien movies. At its best (which is quite often), Pitch Black is an entertaining effort. On the down side, there are times when various largely anonymous characters wander around in the dark and do incredibly stupid things while being stalked by vicious alien creatures. As they get picked off one-by-one, the only question is who's going to be next. The last time writer/director David Twohy wandered into the science fiction arena, the result was the surprisingly intelligent and involving The Arrival, about an alien infestation on Earth. For most of Pitch Black, Twohy has brought the same level of thoughtfulness to this screenplay. The initial half-hour, which details the crash-landing of a spaceship on a barren desert planet, is particularly good. Once the first alien makes its appearance, things become routine from a storyline perspective, but the level of suspense escalates. To fill in the dead spots between alien attacks, we are treated to a series of recycled interpersonal conflicts. And, for those who are bothered by such things, the film's so-called ""science"" employs a few key violations of the laws of physics. The movie begins with the crash, a violent concussion that leaves most of the crew and passengers dead. Among the handful of survivors are Fry (Radha Mitchell), the pilot; Johns (Cole Hauser), a police officer; Riddick (Diesel), a convicted murderer who is being transported in chains; and Inam, a holy man (Keith David). The planet is an apparently lifeless wasteland - a desertscape where three suns assure that there is no night and possibly no water. Shortly after the rough landing, Riddick escapes, but, while the survivors are looking for him, they too are being hunted - by a species of alien that shuns the daylight but is lethal in the dark. Soon, with the realization that the world is about to be plunged into blackness by an inconvenient total eclipse, everyone must learn to trust Riddick, who can see in the dark, if they are to survive. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Riddick's primary goal is self-preservation or redemption. The acting is solid, if largely unremarkable. Most of the principals have fallen effortlessly into the stereotyped roles of quirky characters who are"

The modern visual rules for these shots were set by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" which used a detailed model moving slowly instead of a cheesy model moving fast. Kubrick had the good sense to know that sound does not travel in space, but ""Star Wars,"" with its deep bass rumbles, demonstrated that it certainly should. And then in the ""Alien"" and ""Star Trek"" pictures and in countless others, gigantic space cruisers aimed majestically at the stars, and I felt an inner delight that has its origins in those long-ago days when I devoured pulp space opera by Robert Heinlein and such forgotten masters as Murray Leinster and Eric Frank Russell. My state of mind is best captured by a pulp mag that was defunct even before I started reading science fiction: ""Thrilling Wonder Stories,"" without doubt the best title in the history of magazines. I hope for strange and amazing adventures. Sometimes I am gratified. More often I am disappointed. ""Pitch Black,"" which begins in deep space and ends with a manhunt on a desert planet, falls somewhere in between: clever, done with skill, yet lacking in the cerebral imagination of the best science fiction. How sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions. The movie begins during an interstellar mission, with the crew and a dangerous prisoner all in cryo-sleep. The ship collides with a cluster of rock fragments, which penetrate the hull like BBs through cellophane. The captain and several other sleepers are terminally perforated, and Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes command. The ship crash-lands on a planet that circles somehow within a three-star system, where at least one sun never seems to set, and the surviving crew members have to fight it out with the vicious and cunning prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel). You may remember Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where he was the hard-bitten Pvt. Caparzo. He looks like a mean customer, and he is. He shares no fellow feeling with the other survivors, expresses no responsibility to them, does not consider himself in the same boat and thinks only of escaping. Oh, and his eyes have a remarkable quality: He can see in the dark. Not a very useful ability on a planet with three suns and no night, right? (Hollow laugh.) What disappointed me about ""Pitch Black,"" directed by David Twohy, is that it didn't do more with its alien world, and less with its recycled human conflicts. I feel underwhelmed when humans land on another world and are so quickly reduced to jumping out from behind rocks at one another and playing hostage games. ""Pitch Black"" does have a nice look, all bleached blues and desert sands. And there are some promising story elements, one of which I am about to discuss, so you might want to set this review aside if you plan to see the"

Pitch Black, however, offers precious few twists on its timeworn storyline. Mankind's innate fear of the night is at the heart of Pitch Black: It's Wait Until Dark in space, with the razor-blades-and-scotch vowels of Vin Diesel fronting for Audrey Hepburn, and several thousand omnivorous proto-swallows nicely filling Alan Arkin's shoes. It's also more than a tad reminiscent of James Cameron's Aliens and perhaps even Jurassic Park -- but this last is meant in a good way. (The film wears its homages on its sleeve like a badge of honor.) Most of the time, the film coasts by on dollops of gore and weak suspense, but it's impersonal to the point of being almost existential, which makes the whole thing adrenally invigorating, sort of like a closed MRI with scary pictures taped two inches above your eyes. The film opens with everyone's hyper-sleep being rudely disturbed as a space transport ship carrying 40 passengers is knocked off course by the tail of a wayward comet. Docking Pilot Fry (Mitchell, of High Art) manages to land the ship on an desert planet that features three suns which cause permanent daylight. The survivors include bounty hunter Johns (Hauser) and his murderous prisoner Riddick (Diesel), who is chained, blindfolded, and has a bit in his mouth. A trio of others, including a young stowaway, make up the rest of the landing party, and while the first business at hand is to find water, there's also the disturbing matter of what, exactly, killed all the giant creature skeletons that litter the dusty landscape. As it happens, the bone-owners were stripped of their epidermals by a subterranean, nocturnal species that resembles more than anything flying hammerhead sharks crossed with spiders, and as the planet enters a total solar eclipse, guess who's coming to dinner? That's the setup and things follow more or less predictably from there to the film's resolution. Much of the fun in Twohy's film (and it is fun) comes from his clever use of sound; for a film that takes place in so much darkness, Twohy wisely teamed with Lucas Digital Ltd., Inc. to provide the myriad howlings and hootings of the planet's native species (as well as some well-done opening disaster shots), and the enhanced audio makes a world of difference. Twohy and cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) also make the most of some interesting film stock choices, going for a hideously washed-out look during the film's overexposed triple-daylight scenes and then wiping it all out with the deep, organic blacks and blues of the night shots. Say what you will about the story, but Pitch Black at least looks and sounds stunning. As Riddick, Diesel makes the most of his character's gruff otherness (The angle? He can see in the dark) and Mitchell is, as always, easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast, though,"

I'm not going to try to convince you that this tale of a group of space-crash survivors facing unknown danger on a mysterious planet is a greatly original work. Although it's the splashiest cutting-edge effects picture since ""The Matrix,"" it lacks that work's epic, synthetic sweep. But if your taste runs to that flavor of eye candy, ""Pitch Black"" will rock you. It's a tightly constructed genre picture, combining the best paranoid thrills of the ""Alien"" series with the setting of ""Mad Max"" and the anti-Utopian future of ""Blade Runner."" This is apparently Vin Diesel's big week. In this film, playing Riddick, a sinister, laconic convict with hidden depth, he looks like the first new action star of the 2000s. Meanwhile, in the next chamber of the multiplex, you can see him as a youthful stock-trading shark in the ensemble drama ""Boiler Room."" (Previously, Diesel had a small role in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and was the voice of ""The Iron Giant."") Advertisement: Riddick is a muscular badass, a multiple murderer who apparently shaves his head with axle grease. ""Human blood has a coppery taste,"" he tells Johns (Cole Hauser), the bounty hunter entrusted with taking Riddick back to prison. ""If you cut it with peppermint schnapps it goes away."" But the wiseguy dialogue doesn't conceal a certain soulful intelligence, even sadness, in Riddick. He's a real cool killer whose still waters run deep, not just another snarky asshole in the Schwarzenegger mold. When a Muslim cleric (Keith David) among the castaways accuses him of lacking faith, Riddick avers, ""I absolutely believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker."" Johns, Riddick, the imam, spacecraft captain Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell) and a motley handful of other renegades are the only survivors of a crash-landing on an unknown desert planet, where the combination of three suns means that night never falls. The crash sequence itself, which opens ""Pitch Black,"" is an electrifying thrill ride of chaotic digital animation and distorted photography, which lets you know right away that director David Twohy, cinematographer David Eggby and their collaborators are planning to kick out the jams. While struggling to find water and food on this harsh, apparently uninhabited sphere -- rendered by Eggby (who was, in fact, the cinematographer on ""Mad Max"") in harsh, surreal yellows and blues -- the gang makes a number of unhappy discoveries. Advertisement: There were humans, probably a team of geologists, living on the planet at one time, but something bad happened to them exactly 22 years earlier. The thing that happened was a total eclipse, leaving the planet in darkness and summoning something -- actually, very many, very hungry somethings -- from beneath the surface. The rest of ""Pitch Black"" follows the familiar pattern of a desert-island or haunted-house movie,"
34,DBX_Doc5_Pitch_Black,DBX_Doc5_Pitch_Black,DBX,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be inside a spaceship cracking apart during a violent crash landing, Pitch Black gives you the experience bright and early. The camera jiggles around spasmodically, the actors shout unintelligible gibberish at each other, the sound hammers us. Unfortunately, this describes too much of the rest of the movie, too, without a crash landing as an excuse. Pitch Black is yet another insecure hissy fit of a movie a thriller without enough confidence in itself or its characters to calm down for two seconds and let the actors speak to each other like human beings. Movies like this copy the who-goes-there thrills of Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing without those films' grubby, everyday, human-scaled group dynamics. Here, the spaceship in question is carrying a motley crew mostly headed for someplace called ""New Mecca""; in addition to the expected Muslims (led by Keith David, of The Thing), there's a geologist, an antiques collector, a morphine-addicted cop, a teenage boy who's not what he seems, and a serial killer. This all smacks of gimmickry these aren't people, they're conflict units. In Alien and The Thing, the people confined together were allowed personalities which could then flare up. The only people in Pitch Black with anything resembling a personality are the serial killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and the ship's pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), whose soft features juxtapose nicely with her tough nature. Mostly, the people wander around on the parched, godforsaken rock they've landed on, squabbling over how to escape, while gradually being picked off by slithering monsters who thrive on darkness. Of course, this planet has three suns and thus no darkness, but wouldn't you just know a total eclipse happens to be approaching? Pitch Black does have an imaginative look. Whenever the characters step outside into the alien air, cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) bleaches out everything, which makes sense: These are alien suns whose light is passing through an alien atmosphere, so of course things will look different. And I liked how Riddick, whose eyes have been doctored to allow him to see in the dark, emerges as the unlikely hero who alone can see the ravenous monsters. The Riddick's-eye view of the beasts is a neat touch of psychedelia. Problem is, you may wish you could see through Riddick's eyes all the time. Pitch Black, like so many other horror movies in recent years, is too often so dimly lit that you can't tell what's going on. Yes, the latter half unfolds during an eclipse, but a film can be dark and still be visible (perfect example: Carpenter's Halloween). The expensive, computer-generated creatures lurk around in the dark, revealed to us only in teasing flashes perhaps for the best, considering that what we do see looks heavily indebted to H.R. Giger's Alien/Species designs. And the editing, as usual, is far too jangled; if you don't like a shot, wait two seconds and it'll change. I always chuckle at these"

The last film produced by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, the production was completed for $23 million, and it more than doubled its returns at the worldwide box office. Its modest performance nonetheless announced the arrival of Vin Diesel's action hero stardom; before this and Boiler Room (released on the same day as Pitch Black), Diesel's notable credits consisted of only a small supporting role in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and voicework on Brad Bird's animated gem The Iron Giant (1999). Twohy's movie didn't make Diesel a household name, but it's something both he and his fans have returned to over the years. Many discovered Pitch Black on home video, while Diesel later teamed with Twohy to continue the adventures of the movie's anti-hero, Riddick. Jim and Ken Wheat wrote the screenplay along with Twohy, and the result derives influence from every notable sci-fi classic of the last fifty years. The movie opens with a spacecraft moving steadily through the blackness of space, recalling those iconic shots from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and later Star Wars (1977). Space debris penetrates the hull, and the craft begins to descend into the atmosphere of a nearby planet. With the captain killed in the chaos, pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) considers jettisoning some forty passengers in cryo-sleep so she might survive. She doesn't, and in the ensuing crash, less than a dozen make it. Among the survivors are the Muslim Imam (Keith David), the would-be cop Johns (Cole Hauser), a boy named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), the antiquities dealer Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), and a detained killer named Richard B. Riddick (Diesel). Stranded on a desert planet that has three suns and perpetual sunlight, the survivors pool their resources and head out into the surrounding nothingness to search for water. But the search becomes secondary after the escape of Riddick, a killer whose murderous ways are confirmed by Johns and never denied in Riddick's monosyllabic retorts. Still, we know he's the hero because he's the one narrating. He's eventually caught after one of the survivors mysteriously dies, although he insists he's not responsible. ""All you people are so scared of me."" Diesel's character rumbles. ""Most days, I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now."" Indeed, traveling with Riddick as their captive, they come upon a leftover science camp in which they find no signs of human lifebut they do find large, carnivorous, nocturnal batlike creatures that remain hidden in a web of underground tunnels. Worse, as the camp's former geologists learned, they're about to witness a planetary eclipse that only occurs every 22 years and lasts nearly a month, meaning the dark-dwelling creatures can finally emerge from their slumber to feed. This nonsensical but otherwise intriguing idea comes with plenty of scientific questions, such as how do these"

The first film to feature Vin Diesel in his breakout role of anti-hero Richard B. Riddick, revisiting Pitch Black now Diesel has become as big a star as he is, it's quite refreshing to see how humble the beginnings are for both Diesel's breakout role and the character of Riddick (well, relatively to monster-fighting sci-fi movies). Sure, it may be another in a long line of Alien knock-offs, but at least it's a fun one! The film introduces Riddick aboard a passenger spacecraft on his way to prison, escorted by bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser) along with a crew of commercial passengers. When the craft is struck by shards of a comet, it crash lands on a planet with three suns, an impending eclipse, and an eerily abandoned mining facility. When the passengers discover that they're not alone on the planet's surface and are being hunted by a vicious race of aliens who only come out in the dark, they have to trust in the mysterious Riddick, whose enhanced eyesight may be the only key to their survival. As far as 'things that go bump in the night' concepts go, Pitch Black certainly has a doozy. Sure, it's convenient that the convict in chains has the one ability that should prove incredibly useful against creatures that only come out in the dark, but it only adds to the B-movie/John Carpenter-esque spirit of the whole enterprise. This is a fairly low budget sci-fi horror, and it gets decent mileage out of its premise, even if it does take a bit too long for the sun to go down. The opening act is where the film is at its weakest, setting up cliched characters as cannon fodder whilst it sets the stage for carnage to commence, all of which takes a little too long to let rip. The film is distinct in its aesthetic in these moments, with the three suns leading to three very different styles of lighting. As interesting a creative idea as this is, some of the cinematography can be quite harsh to look at, but it does demonstrate a desire to be a little different and have some visual identity that feels more unique, all the while making good use of its Australian Outback locations to develop a convincing alien world. When it comes to the action, director David Twohy clearly has a lot of fun with teasing his creatures in the shadows, which is often for the best as the early 00's CGI never particularly looks convincing enough when they are revealed in full. The film is at its best when it's either combining practical and visual effects, or when it is throwing its characters out into the darkness with only a few flames and lamps to keep them safe. The creature designs may look a little like pale versions of the bugs in Starship Troopers, but there's enough menace"
37,DBX_Doc8_Pitch_Black,DBX_Doc8_Pitch_Black,DBX,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch_Black,"A passenger spaceship is hit by a rogue asteroid or comet and is forced to make a crash landing on a strange, barren planet that has three suns. The survivors include one crew member, a Muslim pilgrim and his family, an eccentric traveler, a couple of other passengers (i.e. alien food), a cop, and a prisoner named Riddick. All have their own dark secrets and hidden pasts. The survivors soon discover an abandoned geologic research station nearby. All of the scientists are gone, and we quickly find out why. Bizarre, bat-like nocturnal creatures live under the ground in the dark. They seem to be very hungry, too, and the scientists were their last meal. Take a creature from Aliens, mix it with a bat, a panther, and a hammerhead shark and you have these critters. There are also smaller, faster flying versions, too. The survivors realize they must stick together if they will make it off the planet, however most all of them are selfish in their own way. The motto of the group seems to be 'Let's stick together, because when the monsters come I only have to run faster than you to get away!' Can they make it out alive? They must transport some power cells to a small spacecraft at the outpost in order to get off the planet. But (and there's always a 'but') a rare eclipse of the three suns takes place and the planet becomes dark. The creatures then come out in force and the race to get away is on. Only light keeps the creatures at bay, but how long will that last? THE GOOD: THIS IS THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION FILM OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM!!!!!!! (Well, actually the millennium is only one and a half months old, and it technically doesn't start till January 2001, but I wanted to see if I could get quoted like Harry Knowles in Pitch Black ads. :) ) Truthfully, I enjoyed this film. I wanted a good popcorn flick with cool effects and a lot of action, and that's what I got. The plot is not particularly deep, but for what it sets out to do, it does well. The cast was well chosen. Vin Diesel was excellent as the prisoner Riddick. Hes tough, he's mean, and he's definitely no good guy, but you begin to like him nevertheless. Diesel played the part very well and I'd definitely like to see him play this character again. I think he'd be great in other action flicks. The rest of the cast did good jobs as well. The special effects weren't ground breaking caliber, but they were still good. The ship crash had some excellent moments and there is one particular scene where the creatures take flight at the beginning of the eclipse that is memorable. A really beautiful shot as clouds of the creatures swarm in the sky with the eclipse as a background. To make the planet a little more otherworldly, colored filters were used to"
38,DBX_Doc9_Pitch_Black,DBX_Doc9_Pitch_Black,DBX,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"There are just no good aliens anymore. The title character from 1979's ""Alien"" - the film which set the watermark in the genre of which ""Pitch Black"" is a part - was a living, breathing, frightening, fully-realized creation. In the last 21 years, there have been a plethora of ""Alien"" rip-offs, but none of them seemed to realize that what made ""Alien"" work was not the scares or the gore, but the creature itself. By their very nature (they only come out at night, after all) we never get a good look at the creatures in ""Pitch Black"". They fly like winged furies with a force that shakes the camera as they pass, but we learn very little about how the creatures live, except by the educated guesses of the characters (which are seemingly always correct). The non-computer generated cast is competent as a whole. Radha Mitchell (High Art) holds her own nicely as Fry, the tough captain-by-default. Vin Diesel snarls and portends his way through the role of a criminal with a vague record of evil deeds. ""Pitch Black"" has the clever idea of making its creatures only come out when it's completely dark. This gives director David Twohy (The Arrival) the unenviable challenge of lighting his actors with the minimal amount of wattage. Naturally, a movie can't be totally dark - unless, of course, it has the budget of ""The Blair Witch Project"" - so there are occasions when it is unclear where the ambient light is coming from. But, as a whole, Mr. Twohy does a good job keeping his characters in the dark. More startling, however, is the first third of the movie, which takes place in the blazing light of three suns (oddly, the planet doesn't seem hot so much as bright). By supersaturating the film stock, among other trickery, the planetary landscape actually seems very alien - unlike the usual Southern California-scapes in sci-fi film and TV. ""Pitch Black"" largely incorporates pieces from other sci-fi films. Thankfully, it steals from the best. There is a female pilot/heroine (a la Sigorney Weaver in ""Alien""), there's a shackled convict (a la Hannibal Lechter), and there's a spaceship load of false scares to keep the audience screaming. The script, co-written by Mr. Twohy, has enough clever nuances to keep things interesting. Mr. Diesel's character, for example, has surgically augmented eyes which allow him to see in the dark (what luck!). Unfortunately, there is also a ludicrous macho battle between Mr. Diesel's character and his bounty hunter, and plenty of get-us-off-this-rock dialogue. Thankfully, the irony of landing on a planet with three suns only days before a total eclipse isn't lost on the film. As expected, the real star of the film is the special effects work and, in all honesty, some of the shots (the eclipse scene in particular) are beautiful. If only there had been as much time spent on creating believable aliens as there obviously was on the landscape."
39,DBX_Doc10_Pitch_Black,DBX_Doc10_Pitch_Black,DBX,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black,"Is it an active contempt for the audience, I have to wonder, that propels a movie like Pitch Black through production, or is it mere laziness on the part of the filmmakers combined with the unspoken assumption generally an accurate one that moviegoers will watch just about anything with spaceships and lots of gore? Did some executive, considering greenlighting this script, chuckle evilly to himself while calculating precisely how insulting a movie he could produce and still have a decent opening weekend? Or was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was? ""Aliens meets The Fugitive meets Con Air,"" is probably how writer David N. Twohy pitched his script. (Also credited as writers are Jim and Ken Wheat, which simply screams of fanboy brothers who wrote and, god knows how, managed to sell a spec script that had to be even more horrendous than what's onscreen, if the more experienced Twohy had to rewrite it.) Twohy who actually did write The Fugitive, with Jeb Stuart is also responsible for writing and directing another piece of junk science fiction, The Arrival, which is at least enjoyable on a Mystery Science Theater level. With Pitch Black, though, he descends to a new level of awfulness, in which even the film's highly derivative nature cannot make for campy fun. Pitch Black is not good clean bad fun it is an insidious offense to any even halfway-demanding movie fan. Pitch Black starts out, if not exactly promising, then at least momentarily gripping. A commercial freight and passenger ship, traveling through deep space, encounters a meteor storm the small projectiles that rip through the ship are enough to do it serious damage, as well as kill the captain as he sleeps in his cryo chamber. The pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), awakened by the ship to deal with the emergency, finds her ship already burning up as it screams through the atmosphere of a planet. In an intense, protracted sequence, the ship breaks up as Fry fights for control of it and manages to guide it to a not entirely disastrous crash landing on the planet's surface. It's the kind of sequence at the end of which you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief along with the characters. But Pitch Black immediately thereafter starts a long slide downhill that doesn't stop until the end credits roll. Only a handful of the ship's passengers have survived, including Johns (Cole Hauser: Good Will Hunting), a law-enforcement type, and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel: The Iron Giant, Saving Private Ryan), a thoroughly psychotic multiple murderer who, natch, has escaped his industrial-strength restraints in the crash. Besides Fry, there's also a Muslim imam (Keith David: Armageddon, Volcano) and several of his young sons, a teenage boy, and sundry others. The planet, a seemingly lifeless, endless desert under brutal assault by three suns, fortunately has an atmosphere entirely breathable by humans. The unlikeliness of"

The relationships between characters feel superficial and underdeveloped, making it difficult to invest fully in their struggles or triumphs. Even Gru's journey of self-discovery and reconciliation with his long-lost twin brother feels rushed and contrived, lacking the emotional weight and authenticity needed to truly resonate with viewers. As a result, the film's attempts at poignancy come across as forced and unearned, leaving audiences feeling emotionally disconnected and unsatisfied. The humor in ""Despicable Me 3"" often feels formulaic and uninspired, relying too heavily on recycled jokes and tired comedic tropes. While there are certainly moments of genuine wit and clever wordplay scattered throughout the film, they are few and far between amidst a sea of predictable sight gags and juvenile humor. The reliance on slapstick comedy and toilet humor may elicit a few chuckles from younger viewers, but for anyone seeking a more sophisticated or nuanced comedic experience, the film ultimately falls short. One of the most disappointing aspects of ""Despicable Me 3"" is its lackluster portrayal of the villain, Balthazar Bratt. Despite being set up as a formidable antagonist with an intriguing backstory, Bratt ultimately comes across as more of a cartoonish caricature than a genuinely threatening presence. His motivations feel shallow and his actions predictable, robbing the film of any real sense of tension or stakes. As a result, the conflict between Gru and Bratt never reaches the level of intensity necessary to fully engage the audience. While the minions have undoubtedly been a major draw for the franchise, their overexposure in ""Despicable Me 3"" becomes more of a detriment than an asset. Instead of serving as amusing side characters, they dominate the screen time to the point of overshadowing the main protagonist, Gru, and diluting the impact of his story arc. The incessant slapstick humor and gibberish dialogue may appeal to younger viewers, but for older audience members, it feels like a tired gimmick that detracts from the film's overall coherence. ""Despicable Me 3"" seems to fall into the trap of prioritizing visual spectacle over substantive storytelling. The plot feels disjointed and lacking in depth, with too much emphasis on flashy action sequences and not enough on character development or meaningful narrative progression. It's as if the filmmakers relied too heavily on the charm of the minions to carry the film, neglecting to flesh out a compelling storyline that could engage audiences beyond mere surface-level entertainment. ""Despicable Me 3"" suffers from a disjointed plot that prioritizes visual spectacle over meaningful storytelling. The narrative lacks depth and fails to engage audiences beyond surface-level entertainment. Despite potential, the film struggles to balance character development with flashy action sequences, resulting in a narrative that feels shallow and unfulfilling."

Even in an animated film, we want a story and characters that we recognize. The animation is awesome and I enjoyed the Mean Kid actor and his adult incarnation. I quickly became bored with the minions. They have no soul or interest to me. Either way, they're all too innocuous to truly hate. Lowest common denominator in every way: tons of lame jokes, forceful heartfelt moments that aren't earned, and random acts of cuteness. Carell deserves so much better than just being given a tired, silly accent like the worst of Mike Myers. The first two 'Despicable Me' films were fantastic family fun, but, despite absolutely loving the scene-stealing minions 'Minions' was underwhelming (giving the sense, though in all fairness they were not well utilised in their own film, that the minions are better as supporting characters rather than leading). 'Despicable Me 3' is a disappointment after the first two films but is better than 'Minions'. There is a lot to like about it, but it does feel very uneven and gives the sense that the 'Despicable Me' franchise has somewhat run its course. None of it reaches terrible depths though, just that the film could have been much better considering what came before it. Once again, the animation is wonderful. There are rich bright colours, lovingly and appealingly designed characters (nothing looks awkward like some of the human character designs in 'Minions'), meticulously detailed backgrounds and some real visual invention. 'Despicable Me 3' boasts a killer soundtrack that makes one nostalgic for the 80s (with Michael Jackson and Madonna), Heitor Pereira's score is suitably funky and Pharrell Williams' own contribution (especially the heartfelt and cute ""There's Something Special"") is note-worthy too. Some of the writing is witty, sharp and smart and there are some wildly funny and beautifully timed sight gags. One cannot say that 'Despicable Me 3' doesn't have any heart either, there are some sweet and touching moments here. The characters are likable, especially Gru and the minions (who once again steal scenes despite being underused somewhat), and the voice acting is excellent, Steve Carrell has still got it and proves that with good material and with a good character (like with Gru) he is a very talented comic actor (though he has shown a wider range than that too). However, other parts of the humour comes over in a scatter-shot way and suffer from a flabbiness and predictability. To me the villain was also a little bland, didn't find him particularly memorable or that much of a threat, and some of the soundtrack is compromised by the humour coming by so thick and fast that a few of the songs don't register or don't feel necessary."
42,JTA_Doc3_Despicable_Me_3,JTA_Doc3_Despicable_Me_3,JTA,Comedy,Negative,Despicable_Me_3,"The most problematic aspects are the story and the pacing. The pacing occasionally is perfect but at some points it feels tired and at many other points it's almost too hyper-active and jumpy so a lot of the film feels rushed. The story suffers from being over-stuffed and bloated, it's basically three or four plots stuffed into one and not enough time is spent with either. The focus jumps around a lot with some of the transitions on the choppy side so the film and the story-line can feel disjointed. Overall, not a bad film at all but was expecting better considering how good the first two 'Despicable Me' films are. Despicable Me 3 is another obligatory sequel to an animated box-office smash, and it plays out as such: the story's essentially the same as before but the big twist is that South Park co-creator Trey Parker stars in this movie as the lead villain. He does a good job with what he's given, but you wonder WHY he took up the part in the first place!? Was there any real motivation for him doing this besides the money? I think not. What can I say? It's perfectly harmless family entertainment that makes up for a very... 'because-movie' type of film. This pic gets 3/5 stars. Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) had been a child star portraying a lovable villain in the 80s. After losing his job, he decided to become a villain for real. Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) stops Bratt from stealing the world's largest diamond. When the AVL change leadership, they get fired. The Minions abandon after Gru refused to revert to villainy. Gru is told that he has twin brother Dru who is a pig tycoon on the island nation of Freedonia. Dru reveals their late father's super villain persona and wants Gru to teach him the ways of a villain. I still like the characters despite this less-than-stellar outing. It's shocking that the movie without credits is no more than 80 minutes. This feels like a rushed job. I even like Bratt. If not for the love of these characters, I would consider this a failure. As a character, Dru holds some interesting promise. For that promise to be realised, he needs to turn evil. In fact, that should be the plot of this movie. Once Dru is introduced, that turn becomes fully expected and it should be executed sooner rather than later. Despite liking Bratt, I would prefer putting him in cold storage and first developing a better story for Dru. This is a misstep in franchise management. As the 'Minions' movie demonstrated, too much of the adorable, pill- shaped, banana-obsessed creatures isn't necessarily a good thing; indeed, they were probably best in smaller and supporting doses, playing bumbling sidekicks alongside Gru as he went about his villainous, then anti-villainous, ways in 'Despicable Me' and 'Despicable Me 2' respectively. Unfortunately, they aren't given much, if anything, to do in this threequel, who as"

It wants to be about the rivalry between Gru (Steve Carell) and all-new supervillain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), the latter a disgruntled former 80s child TV star who had fallen out of favour with the general public after hitting puberty and has since turned to a life of crime. It wants to be about Gru's new fellow super-agent wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig), who is trying to be a mother to his three adopted daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes. It wants to be about Gru reconciling with his long-lost twin brother Dru, an empty-headed but successful pig farmer who yearns to follow in their father's footsteps of being a super-villain. Amidst all this, it also wants to be about Agnes and her longing to find a unicorn. No wonder then that the sweetness between Gru and his daughters from the earlier two movies is somewhat lost here. No wonder too that the Looney Tunes-esque gags seem to unfold at an almost breakneck pace, sacrificing wit and inventiveness for sheer visual spectacle. No wonder that it all feels drawn-out and overstuffed, cramming too many plot lines without ever developing any satisfactorily except perhaps for the complicated sibling relationship between Gru and Dru, seeing as how the former tricks the latter into helping him break into Bratt's Rubik's Cube-like fortress perched at the tip of a pyramid. It is understandable how returning writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul had felt the need to up the ante with each subsequent instalment of the franchise, but like the 'Minions' spin off, less is sometimes a lot, a lot more. here are good bits though: Bratt, complete with shoulder pads, pump sneakers and 80s pop tunes of Michael Jackson, Van Halen, a-Ha and Madonna among others, is a hoot; so too the barrage of other 80s references, including Bratt's army of weaponised figurines christened 'Bratt Pack'. Carell and Wiig lose none of their verve reprising Gru/ Dru and Lucy, and Parker is a lively, dynamic addition to the ensemble voice cast in particular as a substitute to Russell Brand, whose Dr. Nefario spends the movie frozen in carbonite. Co-directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda try their best-est to keep up the energy and enthusiasm from start to finish, and largely succeed in spite of a somewhat tedious detour on Dru's fictional European island in the middle act. Yet even on the same level of fun as its predecessors, 'Despicable Me 3' falls way short. We wish it were simply that what was once fresh has now become familiar; but oh no, the gags are nowhere near as funny nor as clever, and even the minions are starting to lose their subversive edge. Whether that is the cause or consequence of having too many things going on at the same time is anybody's guess, but the sum of some hilarious bits, some tedious ones and a lot"

Grut's brother owns a posh house, I cool it a posh house anyway. He also seems to have a wonderful looking garden, with great effects. I laughed a bunch of times and had a fun and joyful time watching this movie. I went to look at it's rating and it only gets a 6.3/10. I know a bad movie when I see one, like Boss Baby which somehow gets the same rating as this, Charlotte Webb movies are crap and all that, but no not this movie. I found the plot to not be too confusing, and I actually found the acting and the humour to be really good. The previous installments nicely balanced the over-the-top tricks with the plot, and somehow it was plausible in an imaginary sort of way. But this one? It's as if the writers had the plot then later realized they needed the tricks, and in they went, one by one, arbitrarily, with no real imagination or thought. You can hear the director saying, ""ok, insert a trick here, then there, and there, then there."" With a 90-minute run-time, there were actually five stories going on: the brothers, the unicorn search, the minions' imprisonment, the engagement segment (involving the oldest child, age 12!), and the Brat. Two are eventually irrelevant and unresolved, while the other three meet in the end, but in a forced ""we have to write it this way or the movie has no ending"" sort of way. The premise was interesting - long-lost twin brother wants to resuscitate the family tradition of villainy vs. Gru's new home-bound stability. But the execution was just mediocre, if that. Light laughs, an LOL or two, but that's it. Yup. Ten or twelve minutes. That's right. I stopped watching after less than a quarter into this film based on three things; 1. I didn't laugh or have a spark of interest during the previous mentioned time interval of viewing. 2. The first two films of the series are overrated as funk. 3. Time is too precious to waste on a lackluster cash grab. My opinion is that animated, puppet or cartoon movies, if they are good, can be seen with pleasure both by children and grown-ups. This is not the case with this movie. Despite the fact that is is technically good chiefly in terms of animation and visual effects though not better than the majority of its kind, it is rather weak in terms of the story and sequences. Well I must say that I have not seen the first two movies and that's maybe why I didn't quite understand what the story was about and who are exactly those characters. But the story develops itself in a series of violent actions and events (is this good to be seen by children?)such as collisions, clashes, aggressions and people yelling all the time which have only purely visual effects in"

All the usual characters, spot on witty dialogue, overall great to watch if you are a kid or are entertaining some kids. All the usual stuff from previous movies is in place. This is not and never will be some deep commentary on life as we know it. It is cartoon about a strangely shaped gentleman who has a particular ability to create mischief and be a villain/good guy. I don't know, one of those I'm sure. If you're looking for something brand new and original, this is not the place for you. But personally, I don't rate originality so very high. What you'll find here, is just as my title said: some new variations on the same old story with the same old plot twists and the same old characters. Obviously, the villains have been replaced by new villains, which look like the same old villains. But it's like a great symphony, you can hear it over and over again without being bored, as long as the performance is good. Well the performance is superb. Once again it's slapstick of the highest quality, with just enough wit to tickle our brain. Once again it's a story about the triumph of family and family love over anything trying to separate its members. Yes it's sugarcoated, but the constant appeal to our laughing bone makes the whole thing edible, and as I already said, fun to eat, (and watch). Despicable Me 3 continues with the adventures of Gru(Steve Carell), Lucy(Kristen Wiig), Margo(Miranda Cosgrove), Edith(Dana Gaier), Agnes(Nev Scharrel) & the Minions(Pierre Coffin). Gru meets his twin brother, Dru(Steve Carell). Dru requests Gru to return to his criminal roots & join forces with him, for one final heist. However, Gru must also deal with the super villain, Balthazar Bratt(Trey Parker). Despicable Me 3 is a great movie. It is as entertaining as Despicable Me 2(2013) & far better than Minions(2015). However, Despicable Me(2010) is still the best film in the Despicable Me franchise. Directors Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin perfectly balance the heart, humor & over-the-top action set pieces, that have made these movies so popular. The animation is gorgeous. The 3D in this film, does not quite live up to the 3D effects of its predecessors, or any other animated movie. The vocal performances of the talented cast, are the highlight of the film. Steve Carell is mind blowing as the voice of Gru/Dru. Carell changes his voice in a skilled yet subtle manner, to also play Gru's fun-loving twin brother, Dru. Kristen Wiig is brilliant as Lucy. Trey Parker is awesome as Balthazar Bratt. Miranda Cosgrove is amazing as Margo. Dana Gaier is fantastic as Edith. Nev Scharrel is extremely adorable as Agnes. Witnessing Agnes & all her adventures this time around, will melt your heart, like always. Pierre Coffin is hysterical as the Minions. Steve Coogan is good as Fritz/Silas Ramsbottom. Julie Andrews is spectacular as Gru's Mom. Jenny Slate, Andy Nyman & Adrian Ciscato are"

I loved the previous two movies, but the 2015 Minions movie fell very short of my expectations where the jokes seemed overdone and I kept glancing at the time hoping it would end. I went to the cinema not knowing what to expect, because despite my doubts, at least rotten tomatoes had given it a good rating. From the first scene itself to the last, this movie had me laughing throughout. The jokes were slapstick most of the time, there was no real depth to it, but was there ever? Nevertheless it was good. I instantly loved the villain, the man wearing shoulder pants! While not as entertaining as vector from the first movie, this 80's villain Balthazar Bratth held up as a worthy successor. The minion bits were good, as long as it's not a continuous two hours of the yellow bastards running around and making trouble, they are a treat to watch. The next highlight of the movie was Dru, Gru's twin brother. And not bad at all, Steve Carell manages to do a higher pitch version of the same voice and accent he used with Gru and he nails it. The character blend effortlessly into movie. The third movie follows the same formula as the first two, the super villain causes big trouble kidnapping someone close to Gru while making things go boom boom! While Gru and the family come to the rescue. However unlike most movie trilogies, where the jokes get old and we feel they should just stop *cough cough transformer cough cough* Despicable me 3 manages to keep her charm and deliver a very entertaining movie. I went with my family and everyone enjoyed! This movie was my second favorite out of all of the Despicable Me movies (including Minions). My favorite is the first one. But this movie was so funny and enjoyable to watch! Will your kids enjoy it? Yes they will. Even the Adults should enjoy it. This movie was so funny everyone in theaters laughed at the jokes and so did I and my family. This is a movie worth watching. Third part of the saga and honestly, it is the best. I liked the film very much, each one of the plots were great, especially that of the villainous Balthazar Bratt (the great ones are sure to like and remember moments of the 80s) and the twin Dru that made him laugh a lot. The Minions have few moments, but incredible and very good. I also highlight the moments of the girls with Lucy Wilde, has some very good and exciting backgrounds. I liked the last few minutes, had a very good end and a surprise for me, since I did not expect it. The animation is very good, the soundtrack amazing. 3D is good, but does not have great scenes to highlight. An"

The storyline was a bit weak on this instalment, weak but not poor. A shame that they did not put a little more effort into the ""script"". The visual effect is amazing, really outstanding; sometimes it did seem that there was real life footage being used. Still fun to watch, but the less entertaining of the three movies. But it is a film that is worth watching. I really liked the film. It is funny, touching, fast-paced and gives attention to all its characters. Minions don't dominate the film but are hilarious, the girls are super adorable and Gru-Dru relationships was handled a lot better than I expected. - Seen at world premiere at Annecy. I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time. Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources. Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship. The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with"

The animation is pretty decent, the comedy works (minions excluded) the villian is good. But still, not as good as the first movie. This one is probably the best so far. The main character looks a lot like a vilain in the old Spirou and the fast submarines also. The animation is getting even better it is smashing. The comedy is quite funny but not super hilarious. Excellent overall with great ideas. Reminds me of the Zorglub series also. Loved every second of this one. It feels like every subsequent film is better than the last. This franchise is here to stay. I hope they continue making them forever. To begin, I feel like this was the best villain yet. Bratts character was much more developed than any other of the villains. His backstory was interesting, he was entertaining in his own retro way. One key thing, he actually put up a strong fight against Gru. Feels like the other villains didn't fight too hard. All of the retro vibes emanating from Bratt made me like him even more. He's so stuck In the past and I thought that was cool. The inclusion of a brother was a very nice touch, it made the story feel well rounded. It felt like there was no part of the movie where something key wasn't happening. The Minions musical number was just so fun to watch, a big highlight if you ask me. What happens as a result, was just comedic genius. The Minions ran the joint. That one scene in the jail was very interesting. They are just so darn cool. The scene in the sky, was funny. They bumped into each other and had wtf faces on them. The chase scene with all the Bratt dolls was visually impressive. I like how they weren't at home for this one. Them being outside of their home base added another element to the movie. All of the colors and scenery in Freedonia were just absolutely gorgeous, as was the entire movie. The plot was similar to the other movies. Bad guy steals something, wants to use the item to take over the world. But in this case he just wanted revenge against the industry as a whole. He almost had it. Gru and Drew had very nice chemistry together. I hope he comes back for other installments. Lucy continues to build up her relationship with the girls and they seem to like her now. I don't normally like anything related to Kristen Wig. I just don't care for any of her work (post SNL). But she has been doing a great job voicing Lucy. Thought it was worth mentioning. The best movie in the franchise and they can do no wrong in my eyes. A"

Some funny scenes, great 80s songs and some good Minions humour made Despicable Me 3 enjoyable. I really enjoyed it Despicable Me 3 is my personal 2nd favorite in the series. There are parts of what made the first so amazing and each part shot into one of the sequels and I think Despicable Me 3 did its part better. The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well. Overall, Despicable Me 3 is an extremely enjoyable ride I'd recommend to anyone who can get past its flaws. It was really fun and I laughed A LOT! The plot wasn't great, but the mood of the film was still very fun. Very fun 80's vibe, singing, dancing etc. A lighthearted film and a good laugh, can recommend! please if you make a despicable me 4 please don't make Dru the villain. please make the villain be one of scarlet overkill (minions)children. I know no one from the film will see this but its worth a try. people like me have grown to like Dru. I wish that it wont turn out that way because I think people watching the despicable me"
50,MAL_Doc1_Angel_has_fallen,MAL_Doc1_Angel_has_fallen,MAL,Action,Negative,Angel_has_fallen,"Ever heard of the phrase 'a glutton for punishment'? Of course you have. But just in case, Oxford defines it as ""a person who is always eager to undertake hard or unpleasant tasks"". Tasks like, I don't know, watching Gerard Butler movies? By that definition I'm a walking example of 'a glutton for punishment'. I really can't blame anyone but myself. It's not like Butler doesn't have a pretty telling track record. But I have this twisted fascination with his movie career which is marked by a bevy of stinkers and the extremely rare gem. And in case you're wondering if his latest ""Angel Has Fallen"" is one of the gems...I wouldn't go that far. This is the third film in Butler's Has Fallen series (for lack of a better title). It sees him reprising his role of Secret Service Superman Mike Banning. To be honest I had fun with the first film ""Olympus Has Fallen"". It was a silly, fun throwback to the meat-headed action movies of the early 90's. ""London Has Fallen"" failed miserably at capturing what made the first film entertaining. ""Angel"" falls somewhere in the middle. Stuntman turned director Ric Roman Waugh helms this sequel that essentially follows the same blueprint as the previous films. Mike Banning is recommended by President Alan Trumball (Morgan Freeman) to replace the retiring Secret Service Director (played by the always fun Lance Reddick). But as the series has shown us, the job can take a pretty big toll and Banning's body and psyche is letting him know it. Hilariously this seemingly important story-thread vanishes once the action kicks in. While out on a country fishing trip, an assassination attempt is carried out with a swarm of high-tech drones. Banning barely saves the President's life but everyone else including his Secret Service team are killed. The two lone survivors are taken back to Washington where the President is comatose and Banning finds himself framed for the attack. It doesn't take much investigating before a tunnel-visioned FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) puts Banning under arrest. So much for all of that 'service to his country' bull. Of course like any good Gerry Butler movie, Mike doesn't take it sitting down. He breaks out of custody and sets out to find who framed him and who wants the President dead. He has to seek the help of the last person he wants to see his father Clay (Nick Nolte), a wooly, off-the-grid mountain hermit who (as you can probably guess) ran out on his family when Mike was a child. That is clearly the go-to offense for scorned fathers in movies. Nolte's character adds a little levity but there is little new or fresh about him beyond that. As you should expect, ""Angel Has Fallen"" leans heavily on its action. Some of it is fairly exciting and well shot. Other times it can be pretty generic, even frustrating especially when the scene-killing shaky-cam kicks in. And it's all built around a paper-thin"
51,MAL_Doc2_Angel_has_fallen,MAL_Doc2_Angel_has_fallen,MAL,Action,Negative,Angel_has_fallen,"If action movies are the heavy-metal of the film world then ""Angel Has Fallen,"" starring Gerard Butler in his third turn as Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, is the Ywengie Malsteen of the genre. It's too loud, too frenetic with too many notes. After years on the job, Banning is starting to feel the wear and tear of protecting the president. Concussions have left him with migraines and insomnia. Getting knocked around by bad guys has left him with painful compressed discs, and his doctor is not hopeful. ""You're a disaster waiting to happen."" Things aren't much better at work. According to President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), the White House is ""leakier than a submarine with a screen door,"" with top level info somehow making its way into the hands of nosy reporters. ""I don't know who to trust anymore,"" says Trumbull. Of course, he trusts Banning, so much so he chooses him to head the massive security team accompanying him on a fishing trip. Out on the water it's chilly, but idyllic until hundreds of drones swoop in, wiping out the entire POTUS security detail except for Banning. Later, in the hospital, Banning is grilled by an FBI agent. ""The president is in a coma and your whole team is dead. Tell me how that happened."" Trouble is, he doesn't remember and the FBI, who have discovered his DNA on launch controls, encrypted folders and $10 million in an offshore bank, look at him as the sole suspect. ""President Trumbull's top guardian angel has fallen tonight,"" screams a news report. Banning has saved cities, rescued presidents but can he save himself? Cue the explosions and a rather memorable cameo from Nick Nolte as, what else, a grizzled old man. ""Angel Has Fallen"" plays its hand at every turn, telegraphing the obvious, making sure the audience, who likely aren't paying attention to the dialogue in anticipation of more explosions, get every detail. That means no suspense, just loud noises. Lots of them. Former stuntman-turned-director Ric Roman Waugh loves to blow things up, filling the screen with flames and your ears with booms. It's the stuff of action movies, but when coupled with dialogue that sounds like it was run through the Cliche-O-Matic""I'm not going to stop until I prove you really did this!""the action is more of a distraction from the story than a compliment to it. The film has under currents of social commentary. A bad guy bets on ""making America strong again"" and Danny Houston's character, a war dog named Wade Jennings, ushers in a conversation on private soldiers, but neither are explored in any depth. ""Angel Has Fallen"" has its pleasures. Nolte is a gas and fans of pyrotechnics will be satisfied but it feels more like a direct to steaming actioner than a big screen experience."

In the follow-up to 2013's ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and 2016's ""London Has Fallen"", and in a revisiting no one really asked for, Gerard Butler returns for a paycheck as Mike Banning great action hero name, no? an aging secret service agent struggling with physical impairments that should, one would think, disqualify him from working as the primary line of defense for the President of the United States. In the first two films, our president was played by Aaron Eckhart, and while he must have passed on the titillating chance of not-performing Shakespeare for a third time, we are left with Morgan Freeman, ever an amazing president, voice of God, omniscient narrator, etc. Freeman was also in the two previous films as Speaker of the House, and so it is finally his turn to be hit with unimaginable assassination attempts via tricked-out smart drones with facial recognition capabilities and lots of ammo. Banning is purposefully kept alive, and he dashes on his speedboat to the president, forcing them both under water until the *explosion, explosion, explosion* end. Everyone else is dead. The president falls into a coma, and Banning is under arrest for the slaughter of his security team. Because he is the only one who survived and, despite his track record of staying alive in impossible situations, this one is apparently too outrageous to be anything more than malicious intent. Mid-transfer, his transport car is hijacked and Banning is taken hostage by the real perpetrators whom he handily defeats and escapes. On the lam, Banning has no choice but to seek shelter from his hermit father (Nick Nolte) who left him as a child and has been roughing it in the woods. When the guys who set him up manage to find him, Banning takes control of the situation (read: more explosions, car chases, yada yada) and is drawn to do the job he's done all his adult life: protect and serve. The president, waking from the coma, is in grave danger and Banning is somehow the only person to see it coming. He is the president's only chance at survival, and he weasels his way back to the president's side just in time for the final showdown. In terms of its watchability rating, ""Angel Has Fallen"" isn't the worst action film ever made. Its premise is ridiculous, and its ""twist"" is obvious to anyone with eyes, ears and/or half a brain cell. However, that doesn't mean it's not a fun time. Butler takes his role quite seriously, which actually helps us get through some of the outlandish slog we have to wade through to get to the better bits. The action is high-tech and adrenaline-boosting, and with the talent of veterans Freeman, Nolte, Jada Pinkett Smith underused as an obtuse FBI agent and Danny Huston as Banning's ex-military turned private sector entrepreneur buddy, it isn't hard to let loose and"
53,MAL_Doc4_Angel_has_fallen,MAL_Doc4_Angel_has_fallen,MAL,Action,Negative,Angel_has_fallen,"Gerard Butler is back as super-patriot Mike Banning in this grimly violent action threequel. After the rompy hijinks of 'Die Hard in the White House' aka Olympus Has Fallen and its decidedly less fun sequel London Has Fallen which traded jolly action for overwhelmingly graphic violence and hard-to-stomach xenophobic overtones Gerard Butler's stoic Secret Service agent Mike Banning returns in this slightly-less-brutal threequel. With Angel Has Fallen, the franchise attempts, like so many action series before it, to breath new life into a tired premise by turning things inwards. While Banning usually protects the US President from foreign threats, this time the threat is coming from inside the White House. After an assassination attempt on POTUS leaves only two people alive, Banning is immediately suspected of being behind the operation. The fact that the two survivors are Banning himself and the President (Morgan Freeman), who he is literally paid to keep alive, doesn't seem to matter. This kind of conspiratorial, paranoid storyline works in the Jason Bourne and Mission: Impossible franchises precisely because the heroes' allegiances are fuzzy. Bourne and Hunt are employed by the government, but they protect a personal vision of 'justice'. On the other hand, super-patriot Banning's job is to make sure nothing happens to a specific individual, regardless of what that person might stand for. Yet at no moment in the film does anyone try to come up with a real, existential reason why Banning would ever betray the President, who is not simply his boss but also the boss of America itself. A plethora of evidence collected by FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) appears overwhelmingly to implicate Banning, so much so that one might assume his colleagues would instantly smell a rat and suspect a set up. But in this world, logic is not the most consistent principle. It is only much later, after the death toll has risen considerably, that Thompson remembers the basics of investigative work and wonders: 'Who would have the means to pull this off, and who would benefit from it the most?' The answer, of course, is not, and never was, presidential body guard Mike Banning. But enough about the implausibility of the plot. Movies are not real! Let's talk about the kills. The assassination attempt is the film's biggest set-piece, and as is franchise tradition, it queasily recalls real-life operations in modern American combat. Against the dozens of bomb-carrying drones flying over them, the highly trained agents surrounding the President on his fishing trip in the middle of a lake (?) are utterly powerless. Each one gets blown to bits during an extended sequence of mayhem that is somehow less unpleasant than the scene which soon follows it, in which Agent Thompson calmly looks over the many corpses thrown into unnatural shapes on the bank of the lake. The camera repeatedly lingers on inert bodies throughout the film, drawing attention to the way a person, alive and kicking one minute, can become dead meat in a matter of"
54,MAL_Doc5_Angel_has_fallen,MAL_Doc5_Angel_has_fallen,MAL,Action,Negative,Angel_has_fallen,"Ric Roman Waugh's Angel Has Fallen sees U.S. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler)having returned to his home turf after a trip across the pondcontending with more threats to international security. Mercifully jettisoning the Islamophobia of Babak Najafi's London Has Fallen, the film finds Mike framed for an assassination attempt on President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). And clearing his name appears to hinge, at least at first, on whether or not he learns to grapple with the physical and psychological toll of his previous exploits, as multiple concussions and spinal injuries have saddled him with insomnia and an addiction to painkillers. As a fleet of miniature drones slaughters Trumbull's security detail, it's impossible not to think of Mike's early interactions with his old Army Ranger buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), the head of a private military contractor. Angel Has Fallen introduces Wade openly lamenting that Trumbull's efforts to stop war profiteering have hurt his business. It's almost to the film's credit that Jennings's guilt is never in doubt, meaning that Mike's subsequent escape from custody and quest to clear his name are rooted solely in his having to contend with his traitorous friend's private army, and not some dull mystery centered around who set him up. ADVERTISEMENT Still, the film's framing of Mike as the most wanted man in America is clumsily executed. Given that his face is plastered on screens all over the country, you'd think that the man would be trying to avoid public exposure at all times. In practice, though, Mike is almost always in plain sight, never making any attempt to disguise himself, almost as if he's aware that no one ever seems to recognize him. The only exception to this rule is when he's held up by two armed, backwoods militiamen in Angel Has Fallen's most baffling scene; after all, when one imagines the sort of people who might be driven to an outraged citizen's arrest over an attack on a liberal, black president, one doesn't immediately think of white nationalists. Given the lack of significant impediment to Mike's movements, the film allows plenty of space for action thrills, but Waugh seems to have cobbled his set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection. And because of so much coherence-defying shot continuity, it's impossible to tell what's happening during any given skirmish. Even the nonviolent scenes are jittery and aggressive; a close-up at one point tracks a character picking up a phone with a whip pan so fast that the shot slips out of focus. Worst of all, though, are the special effects that mark the more grandiose set pieces, with smoke from massive explosions hanging statically in the air as a giant, solid mass and, in the film's rooftop climax, the obvious use of green screen revealing image artifacts around the actors' faces. ADVERTISEMENT It doesn't help that, three films into the Fallen series, Mike has almost paradoxically lost some of his dimensionality as a character. In"

This sequel to Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen is an unapologetically old-school, patriotic, ""wrong man accused"" action picture. On that level, it works reasonably well. There's nothing here that hasn't been done a million times before (aside, perhaps, from the event that puts the plot in motion) but if you're in the mood for two straight hours of shootouts and explosions, the movie gives you plenty of literal bang for your buck. Gerard Butler returns as Mike Banning. He's considering an offer from President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) to become the director of the Secret Service. Actually, he's thinking of turning it down. He simply likes on-the-ground action too much. During a fishing trip, Trumbull is attacked by a fleet of drones, which wipe out his entire protection team, aside from Banning. Both men are knocked unconscious, and when Banning awakens in the hospital, he is immediately arrested for attempted murder. FBI agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) seemingly has evidence to suggest that he planned the entire attack. Banning, of course, knows he's innocent, so he goes on the run to clear his name. One of the two villains is given away in the film's trailer, and the other is someone any alert viewer will easily guess. Angel Has Fallen scores no points in the originality department on that count. At least it has Nick Nolte as Banning's estranged, war-traumatized father Clay, a stock character the actor brings wonderfully to life. Angel Has Fallen never goes more than a couple of minutes without a major action sequence. Director Ric Roman Waugh stages them impressively. The drone attack is especially eerie, while a third-act assault on a hospital effectively conveys the sense of panic when violence breaks out in a crowded place. These scenes aren't necessarily realistic all the time. Clay's booby-trapped forest hideaway, for example, stretches credibility a bit. Nevertheless, you go to a picture like this for non-stop action, and that's exactly what you get. Growing restless is never an option because something is always happening. It's in the story that Angel falters more. The bad guys are obvious, and their plan, if you think about it too much, doesn't particularly hold up to logic. Strained father-son relationships like the one between Banning and Clay have been done countless times onscreen. No real mystery exists as to whether Banning will be able to clear his name. And, of course, his wife Leah (Piper Perabo) has nothing to do except express worry about what's happening to her husband. The key here is that the actors approach the material with enthusiasm. Even though the plot is formulaic, they give everything they have. Butler hits a good balance of tough and charming, Freeman brings his trademark stoicism, and Pinkett Smith nicely plays against type. As for Nolte, he steals every scene he's in, playing a familiar character with such endearing crankiness that we can't help"
56,MAL_Doc7_Angel_has_fallen,MAL_Doc7_Angel_has_fallen,MAL,Action,Positive,Angel_has_fallen,"The unlikely Has Fallen franchise, a series of films starring Gerard Butler as near-superhuman Secret Service agent Mike Banning, have thus far been jingoistic throwbacks whose lack of depth or flair was buoyed by a unique and persistent dedication to grisly, patriotic violence. They're ugly films bereft of style or grace, but long on ferocity. The latest entry, Angel Has Fallen, shrewdly pivots from the paradigm for a film that breaks the cycle for more fascinating results. First, he saved the President from terrorists taking over the White House and then he did it again, but this time, in London, Mike Banning isn't the first at bat in a feature length, one-setting action sequence. Rather than try for the Die Hard-in-a-hat trick, incoming director Ric Roman Waugh brings the grit and scope of his gangster epic Shot Caller to Mike's shoot-em-up world. This is the first of these films where Mike is an actual character, someone the audience spends time with outside of stabbing foreigners directly in the skull while barking at bureaucrats in a remote strong hold. The Mike Banning of Angel Has Fallen isn't so unstoppable. Instead of the Herculean embodiment of American resolve, he's broken down, wounded, with a painkiller addiction and a litany of injuries sustained over the last two films. He's in line for a promotion to be the new Director of the Secret Service, a desk job that would keep him out of the line of fire and give him more time with his wife (Piper Perabo replacing Radha Mitchell) and young child. But Mike isn't ready to lay down his sword when his king still needs protection. So, when an army of drones kills Mike's entire team and leaves President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) in a coma, FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett-Smith) is convinced he's behind the attack, especially when they find $10 million from Russia in an offshore account bearing his name. Mike's gotta go on the run, both from the entire nation out to catch the guy who tried to kill a beloved leader and from the sketchy private military guys who framed him in the first place, led by Mike's old friend Wade (Danny Huston). Events play out more in The Fugitive vein than the reactionary bulletfests of the earlier films, but there's still room for big explosions and copious combat. The downside to this paradigm shift is that Angel Has Fallen feels more like a straightforward thriller, a throwback to Tom Clancy adaptations and not the ruthlessly violent films to which its predecessors paid homage. But by taking more time to build the plot and stack the deck against Mike Banning, when the action does pop off, it feels more welcome. Outside of the murky opening sequence, every bit of action Waugh stages is effective, a far cry from the muddy ugliness of the other two films. Working with frequent Luc Besson collaborator Robert Mark Kamen on the script, Waugh lends the franchise's propaganda welcome shades of gray, forcing this"

While on the run from those who framed him and from FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith), he reunites with his father (Nick Nolte) who's been hiding out off the grid in the middle of a forest. Angel Has Fallen is a slight improvement over London Has Fallen and just as fun as Olympus Has Fallen. The screenplay by writer/director Ric Roman Waugh, Robert Mark Kamen and Matt Cook lacks logic, reason, nuance and realism, but who goes to an action thriller like Angel Has Fallen looking for any of those qualities? This is a B-movie and it wears that badge proudly on its sleeve. Mike survives shoot-outs and explosions while barely sweating, and his hair doesn't even get the slightest bit messy. He must have some very powerful hair gel and anti-perspirant. It's hard to see some of the action sequences because of poor lighting and cinematography, although there are some action scenes that are suspenseful and exciting as long as you suspend your disbelief. Some scenes, like one toward the end with two characters talking on a rooftop, last too long and make the pacing feel uneven. The twists can be seen from a mile away, so don't expect anything that's surprising or groundbreaking. There are failed attempts to ground the film in humanism, like by showing scenes of Mike with his wife, Leah (Piper Perabo), but they're clunky and contrived moments that are, fortunately, ephemeral. The same can be said about the expositional scenes which the screenwriters don't quite have a knack of handling in an organic way. If you can feel the wheels of the screenplay turning during those scenes and you're fully aware that they're exposition, then they're not very effective. Filmmaker Avi Nesher once told me in an interview that a way to cleverly hide exposition is to have the character giving the exposition while doing something else, i.e. cooking, at the same time. Many screenwriters can learn a lot from heeding Nesher's words of wisdom. Danny Huston, Gerard Butler and Tim Blake Nelson provide plenty of charisma on screen and are very well cast. They make the most out of the shallow dialogue that they're given. There's also just enough moments of comic relief some of which are very funny and even witty, so it's worth noting that Angel Has Fallen doesn't take itself too seriously. A mid-credits scene is outrageously funny albeit very random and bizarre. At a running time of a slightly overlong 114 minutes, Angel Has Fall is a rousing white-knuckle thriller that's a rush of pure adrenaline. It's a satisfying slice of mindless entertainment."

One would reasonably expect the next outing in the Fallen trilogy to ""up the ante"" even more and it sure does. The entire world is now about to collapse, as war between the U.S. and Russia seems imminent. And the one man, the hero who has now saved the U.S. president twice from evil foreigners, has... well, fallen. But not really. No one really expects the Terminator-like Mike Banning (played with the usual mix of detachment/arrogance by the ever-so-dislikeable Gerard Butler) to take a bullet though, mind you, he would, for his nation, for Amurrica. The chest-thumping groundless patriotism, blatant xenophobia, dumb-as-nails dialogue and predictable plot that made the first two films so reprehensible are all still present and yet, Angel Has Fallen ends up being the most guiltily enjoyable out of the three, almost despite itself. ""Mike has to escape from the law, prove his innocence, and beat the evil guys before they ignite the War to End All Wars."" Plagued with PTSD headaches and facial tics, our hero Mike is nevertheless on the verge of getting promoted to Secret Service Director. Lo and behold and I bet you didn't see it coming he gets framed for the attempted murder of longtime friend, President Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). With Trumbull stuck in a coma, Mike has to escape from the law, prove his innocence, and beat the evil guys before they ignite the War to End All Wars. The worst thing about all this? Mike has kept his migraine-like spasms secret from his wife Leah (Piper Perabo). Ouch, brah. Testosterone-fueled and jingoistic to an unintentionally-laughable degree, the film also resembles dozens of ""wrongfully accused"" clones. That particular sub-genre of action flicks has even been spoofed two decades ago, albeit poorly, in the aptly-named Liam Nielsen-starrer Wrongfully Accused. The screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook, and Ric Roman Waugh struggles to infuse the proceedings with some real-time relevance (evil Russian hackers, corrupt politicians), but ironically has the opposite effect, its archaic, one-dimensional notions of ""good"" and ""evil"" instantly rendering the film dated. Also, it has people saying stuff like, ""You were the necessary evil, caught at the right place at the right time."" ""...it's all uber-violent, in-your-face, completely lacking sophistication..."" If you're an ardent action fan looking to get the heart racing and your thick skin can withstand the assault of empty rhetoric Angel Has Fallen has enough inspired, goofy moments to satiate your appetite. A drone attack, consisting of a flock of tiny bots spat out of a machine akin to tennis balls, tingles the nerves. Mike driving a giant truck through thick woods, as a slew of cop cars and helicopters chase him, is skillfully staged as is the rooftop-set final showdown. Nick Nolte steals the show (though or, rather, because he doesn't seem to be aware where he is) as Mike's pyromaniac, off-the-grid dad Clay. Yes, it's all uber-violent, in-your-face, completely"
59,MAL_Doc10_Angel_has_fallen,MAL_Doc10_Angel_has_fallen,MAL,Action,Positive,Angel_has_fallen,"Angel Has Fallen is what used to be called a B movie, but it delivers the goods briskly and has some resonance for grownup viewers, despite an over-the-top plot with few surprises and a director who started as a stuntman this is the film Brad Pitt's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood character might have made if he got an auteur break. As in the previous two films in the series, Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen, Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, who turns 50 in November) guards the president (Morgan Freeman, 82, who seems amused to be playing a president yet again) against assassins, who stage a spectacular attack by a flock of killer drones with face-recognition software. Eighteen Secret Service agents die, but (no spoiler) Banning saves the president, who unfortunately is in a coma and can't tell anyone who saved him. So the vice president (Tim Blake Nelson, 55) and the FBI agent on the case (Jada Pinkett Smith) find it suspicious that the drones recognized and spared Banning's face. And we find it suspicious that Danny Huston, 57, plays Banning's best old war buddy Jennings. Huston is more typecast as a bad guy than Freeman is as a president, and his sinister circumflex eyebrows echo his father John Huston as the ultimate baddie in Chinatown. But it's easy to relate when Jennings and Banning talk about feeling their age and resisting the pressure to retire, or to take a desk job that amounts to the same thing. ""We are lions!"" Jennings says. ""If I had my way, I would keep hard-charging till the day I die,"" replies Banning. Meanwhile, he's tormented by aches, pains, 15 pounds of belly fat that won't go away, concussions, migraines, and a painkiller dependency he won't confess to his wife (Piper Perabo) or the president, and his face looks like a steak somebody beat with a meat tenderizer. He nonetheless rises to the occasion, ingeniously and athletically eluding the FBI manhunt and best pal Jennings' scheme to frame and kill him and the president. (Again, this is no spoiler: The Jennings betrayal comes early; another baddie serves as the third-act reveal.) The action intensifies when Banning flees to Kentucky to hide out with his Vietnam vet dad (Nick Nolte, 78), a paranoid survivalist like a less psychotic Unabomber who's booby-trapped his rural redoubt (much like the booby-trapped woods in Nolte's first great movie, 1978's Who'll Stop the Rain). Nolte's grizzled, long-AWOL dad has a merry, irascible determination, and the movie comes alive when he tussles emotionally with his son Banning and fireworks fill the air with stuntmen. Beneath the B-movie mechanics and genially over-the-top dialogue, there are grownup hearts beating in Angel Has Fallen. Butler and Nolte make you buy their mutually exasperated reconciliation. Compared to the generic characters of Nelson and Smith, they're deep, and the talented Huston really sells his buddy scenes with Banning and his ruthlessly scheming betrayal scenes, too.

60,MEU_Doc1_Fresh,MEU_Doc1_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Modern dating can make a girl feel like a real slab of meat at least, that's the central thesis of Mimi Cave's debut Fresh, a horror-comedy with its teeth filed down to stubs. ""Hopefully, this'll make for a good story,"" Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) tells her BFF Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) before she heads off on a date with the most blandly vile man you can imagine: he monologues about acid reflux, tells her she'd look prettier in a dress, spouts some racism at their waiter, and then calls Noa a ""bitch"" when she doesn't want to kiss him. When Noa gets back home, she tries to message another guy. He immediately responds with a dick pic. So who could blame her for ignoring every red flag presented by Steve (Sebastian Stan), who approaches her in a grocery store and jokes about how cotton candy grapes really do taste like cotton candy. Steve seems all too perfect: he loves to dance in the middle of his living room, he doesn't want to rush into sex, and he isn't on social media (which the film treats as immediately suspect, but I would argue is the romantic ideal). Noa complains that dating reduces us all to ""the perfect projection"", but she's just as willing to play into romcom fantasy: she's a ""pancakes out of a bag"" kind of girl, he's a sophisticated cocktail connoisseur. As Mollie points out: ""It's a straight girl's fantasy come true!"" It's a very relatable sort of hypocrisy. And when Steve whisks Noa away for a weekend out in nature, we're meant to read it as passionate and spontaneous right up to the moment the film's title belatedly drops, around half an hour in, and we find out that he's actually a cannibal. Not a hobbyist cannibal, mind you, but a professional one, carving up women for wealthy clients while keeping them chained in his basement so the meat stays fresh. But Cave's film proves that there's a clear difference between clever metaphors and satisfying ones. The way Steve looks Noa dead in the eyes and says ""I'm taking your ass"" is a very dark but funny joke. And Cave, certainly, leans into the film's tongue-in-cheek quality. Fresh is shot by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, known for his work on both Hereditary and Midsommar, and the camera lurches around Steve's mid-century basement dungeon (quite nice if you take it out of context) in queasy disbelief at what's going on. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Steve is carving up body parts for human meatballs and human prosciutto while dancing to Peter Cetera's ""Restless Heart"". In another scene, he trudges into Noa's room, whining about how exhausting it is to chop up women all day. Stan has clearly been directed to give us Patrick Bateman with a Hannibal Lecter garnish, and it's effective for what it is. But Bateman of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho always represented a somewhat outsized vision of male narcissism, and Fresh can't ever decide how much this film"
61,MEU_Doc2_Fresh,MEU_Doc2_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"While just about everything else has been made easier with the invention of apps, dating still feels like a chore. The lonely Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) knows this all too well in Fresh. Mimi Cave's directorial debut shadows a cynical twenty-something as she bounces from one disappointing date to another. However, being randomly picked up by a handsome surgeon at the grocery store seems like Noa's luck is finally changing. Unfortunately for her, it's not for the better. As far as Noa can tell, Steve (Sebastian Stan) is a total catch. Her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) is naturally suspicious of everyone, but her instincts might be right in this case. Steve's peculiarities for example, him having no online presence can be interpreted as flaws. Maybe even red flags. For someone like Noa, though, she simply wants to be wanted. It's only understandable she looks the other way. Everyone watching, on the other hand, is waiting for the other shoe to drop. Cave and writer Lauryn Kahn are not looking to undermine the audience's expectations here. They've set up everything according to genre regulations and not following up on those foreshadowing moments would be foolish and not to mention a waste of time. It also would have been easy but agonizing to draw things out. More pleasing than not, Fresh reveals its hand earlier than anticipated. Knowing the truth doesn't lessen the revelation's impact or remove tension, either. That level of shock regarding that plot turn will vary from person to person. Some people are simply more prepared to assume the worst. Fresh is wise to speed through the formalities of these kinds of thrillers and get straight to the meat of the predicament. This leaves room for more engaging storytelling rather than working overtime to uphold the current mystery. Instead, there is a reasonably good amount of suspenseful interactions between the two opposing characters. Noa is never written to be a victim who lacks agency in her situation. Even when she's down for a spell, Noa is always thinking of how she can help herself. The filmmakers of Fresh have a considerable deal of respect for their protagonist in spite of the misfortune they've subjected her to. Steve's unsavoriness is digestible thanks to Stan's devilish charm, but not to the point where it feels like the film wants him to get away with his wrongdoing. Now if only Mollie and another supporting character, Paul (Dayo Okeniyi), had been afforded the same care as the leads. There are too many times where they are less authentic than their peers. It's unclear if something like Fresh will have a long shelf life. Although, it does well not to dwell on the technological aspects of the modern dating scene. The writing is never offensively straightforward either, yet there are times the script veers toward middle-of-the-road in the face of such an unusual premise and outcome. Still, there are plenty of times where this feels like the jewel in the crown of dating"
62,MEU_Doc3_Fresh,MEU_Doc3_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"The creepiest moments in Mimi Cave's thriller Fresh are rooted in the familiar. These moments are creepier not in spite of their everyday banality, but because of it. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays a young woman navigating the dystopia that is modern dating. Like any young woman, she has become used to the idea that the onus is on her to stay on guard. Walking alone in a dark alleyway, she keeps her car key in a ready-to-jab position when she thinks she is being followed. A guy on a dating app responds to her comment on his cute cat pic with an unsolicited dick pic. The panic is writ large on her face when she can't get any bars on her phone. If women are terrified of walking home alone at night or losing cell phone reception, it is due to the sinister forces that lurk in the darkness. The forces don't get more sinister than in Cave's debut feature, which stirs up a batch of stew from the leftovers of American Psycho and You and calls it Fresh. Marinating the film is a touch of her own creative sadism. The gristle is its conceit of how women are commodified. As the film marches on, some succumb to the commodification, one joins in, and the rest figure out a way to overcome it and survive. Online dating isn't working out for Noa (Edgar-Jones). Just when she is about to resign herself to a life of quiet solitude, she runs into handsome plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan) at the supermarket. They flirt over cotton-candy grapes, he makes some excuse to get her number, they bond over dead parents on the first date, and soon he is whisking her off on a getaway. If there is a red flag, it's that he has no social media presence and can't be found on Google. Noa's best friend Mollie (Jonica T Gibbs) voices some concern, but Noa writes it off as Steve favouring the old-fashioned ways just as much as he does his Old Fashioneds. After a half-an-hour or so is when the opening credits pop up to reveal what we're watching is in fact a horror movie. The romance, like many of the beloved entries of the genre, was to wear down the woman's defences till she gave in. Steve was playing a long con and not for the first time, as Noa soon realises. A whole network of rich, powerful men (let's call them the patriarchy) depend on him to cater to their very particular appetite. To go into any more detail will only ruin the movie. Despite the swerves, there is little doubt over how the story will pan out, or the ostensible catharsis of its inevitable conclusion. Shape-shifting between sweet and sinister with a mere smile, Stan captures the insidiousness of a practiced deceiver who knows how to weaponise his disarming charm. When he calmly reveals Noa of her fate and loses his temper over her reaction, we witness the monster"
63,MEU_Doc4_Fresh,MEU_Doc4_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Maybe the biggest reason that Mimi Cave's Fresh falls so short of being the movie it wants to be is how sure it is that it's funny. With the exception of a good opening scene, in which Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) goes on a first date that goes poorly in a way that we come to realize is not that out of the ordinary, most of the movie's attempts at comedy take the form of a sarcastic, quippy tone instead of any actual jokes. It's like when someone replies to another person's clever remark with, ""I see what you did there"" and thinks they've risen to the established cleverness level themselves. Fresh is a whole movie of ""I see what you did there."" Like I said, that's probably the biggest reason the movie doesn't succeed but it's not the only one. Noa is so vocal about being sick of dating the same lame guys that when she has a meet-cute with an actual nice man at the grocery store, it should be immediately clear to anyone with any nose for dramatic irony whatsoever that he's bad news. But Noa blows past one red flag after another in her new relationship, culminating in accepting Steve's (Sebastian Stan) offer to go on a weekend getaway to an undisclosed location before she even knows anything about him. She behaves like a movie character, not like a human being. The specifics of what Steve turns out to have planned (which I won't spoil for anyone who doesn't yet know) are admittedly unique but there's still the sense, plotwise, that we know what's going to happen because we've seen this before. That makes Fresh the second movie already in this still young year in which Stan is very obviously the bad guy even before that's officially revealed. Maybe a history of playing sleazeballs is the reason he and Edgar-Jones seem to have so little chemistry. But it would have made Noa's decisions more digestible were we able to feel a spark between them. Once Steve's villainy is confirmed, though, Stan does start to feel like a good casting choice. Early on, Noa and her friend, Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), discuss having had their notions of love warped by too much early exposure to Disney romance. So it makes a kind of sense that Noa would fall for someone who looks like a cartoon prince. Or perhaps a better comparison for Steve's look is 1980s heartthrobs like Rob Lowe or Patrick Dempsey. That would fit with the character's penchant for overproduced pop-rock ballads by the likes of Peter Cetera and Richard Marx. But, like so much else here, those song choices feel cynical and on the nose, the movie reducing itself to something processed, snackable but not nourishing. By the time Cave gets to her most obnoxious needle drop, an orchestral cover of Radiohead's ""Exit Music (for a Film)""the most prominent lyric of which, ""We hope that you choke,"" is eye-rollingly germane to the onscreen actionall I"

The guy is pretentious, wears a scarf indoors, asks her to dress more ""feminine,"" and doesn't have any money to cover the bill. The way director Mimi Cave enters the audience into the world of Fresh will have them thinking this is a conventional rom-com. Noa confines in her best friend, Millie (Jonica T. Gibbs) about the inefficiencies of dating apps and loses hope of finding that special someone. While at a grocery store, Noa meets Steve in a produce aisle (Sebastian Stan), who checks off the boxes for her. He's funny, good-looking, caring, and a doctor. They hit it off quickly and decide to go away for a weekend together. But some things don't add up. Steve, while charmingly persuasive, doesn't have any social media accounts, as pointed out by Millie. In 2022, that's fairly odd, but Noa's killed a lot of frogs to get to this point. It's believable she has allowed herself to get so drawn in. Noa and Steve venture off to his secluded, swanky place, but there's lack of cell service. As Noa relaxes with a drink Steve has prepared for her, she gets a little woozy. It's then that she realizes his inviting essence is more of a trap. At the 30-minute mark, a title card goes across the screen. First-time director Mimi Cave lulls the audience into an inventive sense of security like Steve, but now it's time for the main course (pun intended). When you find out what Steve is really up to, you get a real sense of how far his depravity goes. Noa is not the only one who has gotten entangled in his deceitful web there are other women inside the sprawling compound with her held captive. Why, this is where the cinematography of Pawel Pogorzelski comes in. Every bite of food within Fresh is shown with such detail that you can almost imagine the way it tastes. From delectable gourmet dishes and cut of steak, the textures have a specific quality to them. It only makes it that much more worth it once you find out where some of these meals are coming from. Cave doesn't go for overt gore and blood Fresh takes a less is more approach. There is enough implied harshness throughout the film where it doesn't need to be a gratuitous slasher to work. Writer Lauryn Kahn doesn't strive to keep Noa's character as a docile, damsel-in distress. Much credit to the acting of Edgar-Jones, despite the danger her character faces, she remains steadfast and clever to beat Steven at his game. There are some parts where things fall short. Millie's arc is relegated to detective duty, frantically trying to get to the bottom of her friend's whereabouts an unfortunate trope seen with Black characters. There's an underlining story of how the bodies of women are perceived and coveted in society. It would have been great if her character had more"
65,MEU_Doc6_Fresh,MEU_Doc6_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Thankfully, I haven't had to contemplate the rigors of the dating scene for more than 20 years. Even in the late 1990s, it was no picnic unless you happen to like a challenge and select an actual picnic as a first-date stratagem for someone you met online, in a bar, or through a real-world social network such as church, professional associations, community organizations, fitness centers, or support groups. For someone with social anxiety, initiating any new relationship is strenuous and exhausting. The more you think about all the things that could go wrong, the more terrifying it seems. The dating scene can be perceived as a nightmarish wasteland populated by toxic narcissists, condescending misogynists, and other assorted sociopaths and that makes it the perfect backdrop for modern horror cinema. In recent years, breakout filmmakers have delivered a steady stream of horror movies revolving around toxic relationships. These are the antithesis of the rom-com: They are designed to critique the psychology of modern dating and make viewers reflect upon the interpersonal processes that are in play as a relationship develops. The films cover everything from meeting the parents (see ""Get Out,"" 2017) and shared holidays (see ""Midsommar,"" 2019) to dealing with children from prior marriages (see ""The Lodge,"" 2020) and full-throttle, hardcore obsession (see ""Pet,"" 2016). Joining this pack of films that capitalize on the apprehension and vulnerability that comes with dating is ""Fresh,"" the directorial debut for Mimi Cave. The film was released March 4 on Hulu by Searchlight Pictures. The film opens with a vignette depicting what appears to be a worst-case first-date scenario: Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) meets Chad (Brett Dier) for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where he talks about his acid reflux, criticizes her clothing and her appearance, makes her pay for both their meals, and commandeers her leftovers for himself. It goes downhill from there but, at least Chad's unpleasantness never amounts to anything more than the whiny chauvinism of a malcontent deadbeat. After discussing the pitfalls of dating apps with her friend Mollie (Jonica T. Gibbs), Noa has a chance meeting with Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store. She finds his awkward humor charming, and he convinces her to give him her number. They connect over the course of a few dates, and Steve invites her to run off with him for a romantic weekend getaway. The destination, he tells her, is a surprise. Red flag, anyone? This is where ""Fresh"" does something that's well, fresh. Up until this point, approximately 30 minutes into the film, the script could have been heading in a number of different directions. Comedy, romance, drama any one of these paths could have been possible. Shortly after Noa and Steve arrive at their destination, the bottom drops out and, around the 33-minute mark, the film's opening credits appear onscreen. What transpires over the remaining 80 minutes of running time is a provocative, grotesque feast of decadence and an attack on entitlement. Going into too much detail would spoil the"

Last year, CODA was the first film most people watched at the beginning of the festival, and it ended up as one of the very best movies of 2021 in my case, as my own indisputable number one pick of the year. Mimi Cave's directorial debut might follow the same route. An important advice: this film holds shocking developments that are better enjoyed if unspoiled, so beware of possible spoilers circulating social media. In the film, the viewer is quickly introduced to Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), a young woman looking for the man of her life in dating apps. Not soon after, Steve (Sebastian Stan) enters Noa's life, after a quick meet-cute at a grocery store. A random encounter leads to subsequent dates, and it becomes tremendously easy for the viewer to feel captivated by the charming & witty couple. From the simple yet efficient exposition of their first date, to the subtle yet powerful build-up to the strangely off-putting weekend getaway; Cave shows clear vision by not wasting time with the ""awkward preamble"", as Noa states at one point. The opening credits start to roll at the end of the admittedly fast first act. Shocking revelations, mind-blowing plot twists, and extremely impactful outcomes usually occur near or during a climactic third act in a standard Horror flick. Lauryn Kahn's wicked screenplay on the other hand presents these key beats at around the half-hour mark. On one hand, it makes the beginning of the movie incredibly fascinating; not letting the viewers turn their eyes off-screen. On the other hand, it risks leaving the rest of the film without major cards to play where the second act sacrifices some engagement. As the runtime progresses, FRESH becomes more violent, bloody, gruesome, and revolting. Cave often uses Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography to expand the audience's imagination, putting the viewer through utterly appalling close-ups that might make some queasy watchers look away. The sound design is particularly compelling during these sequences akin to an ASMR video. The themes/topics surrounding technology, online security, feminism, and a particular topic (which I can't disclose) are all thoroughly explored, without ever feeling forced or attending a biased agenda. It's also impossible to discuss this film without addressing the phenomenal acting involved. Sebastian Stan (The Devil All the Time) and Daisy Edgar-Jones (Pond Life) are both unbelievably delicious in their individual roles. It's difficult to choose an MVP. Despite Stan being quite well-known; the actor shows a psychotic side to his persona that will make young fans of the MCU run and scream. However, Edgar-Jones presumably delivers her breakthrough display, at least in the cinema realm. From the sweet, hilarious, friendly Noa to the emotionally devastated yet strong and evolved version of the same character featured later on in the film; the actress shines bright in every single beat."
67,MEU_Doc8_Fresh,MEU_Doc8_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Modern dating is a real killer. When you're not fending off oafish Chads who reminisce about the good ole days when women wore dresses and embraced gendered stereotypes, you're blocking dick pics, and falling prey to the charming good looks of men like Sebastian Stan. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is the quintessential girl next door, just trying to make her way through life and maybe finding someone to fall in love with along the way. She has her best friend Mollie (JoJo T. Gibbs), but no family to speak of, which plays into the sharp turn her life takes when Steve (Sebastian Stan) strolls into her life on a late-night grocery store run. While Stan's chiseled cheekbones and endearing dimples might put him head above most of the men on dating apps, Steve comes across as an everyman. He ingratiates himself into the realm of ""safe men"" by talking about his sister and niece, seducing Noa with cotton candy grapesnone of which could have hinted at his gruesome predilections. FRESH features a bitingly witty screenplay by Lauryn Kahn, and Mimi Cave's directorial debut features some absolutely ingenious visual allusions, cut scenes, and off-beat aesthetics. It's hard not to compare FRESH to projects adjacent to its plot. Daisy Edgar-Jones has shades of Love in Netflix's You, while Stan fully embodies the alluring seduction of Patrick Bateman's sinister antics in Mary Harron's American Psycho. The American Psycho connection is unmissable, with a delightfully insane soundtrack featured in FRESH. While no sequence can ever fully outmatch Bateman's ""Hip to Be Square"" mayhem, Stan gives Christian Bale a run for his money with a hypnotically chaotic performance in the second act of the film. His performance becomes even more impressive as the final act closes in and he treads this unnerving line of normalizing the abnormal with smug charm. You never know if you should laugh at his dreadful puns or run. Cave takes a new approach to the cold open, playing out forty-five minutes of build-up and action before the title ever appears on the screen. Its placement is ingenious, arriving right as the meet-cute turns into a meat-cute. Beyond the American Psycho comparison, FRESH pulls from other off-beat horror classics so succinctly, blending them all together and serving them up for slow-burn horror fans to really feast on. Cave captures the intensity and uneasiness of the film through extreme close-ups, focusing on mouths and eyes while intercutting with inserts that really drive home the plot. At times, FRESH can be a little messy, but the plot never really waivers. Kahn's screenplay is very narrative-driven, focusing in on Noa and Steve, with a few characters that circle their orbit. The commentary is neatly delivered, letting audiences pick up what it's putting down without spoon-feeding it to them. There are allusions to the tastes of the ultrarich, the vicious dating culture, and the agency that is often stripped away from women's bodies. It's all very engagingly deployed and strengthens the core plot being played out."

Edgar-Jones is Noa, a young woman who is clearly having a rough time of it in the modern dating scene until she meets the charming Steve (Sebastian Stan). Handsome, funny, self-deprecating, and even a doctor, Steve ticks all the right boxes, so Noa doesn't think twice about going away for a weekend with him. But if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, which is why Noa wakes up in a cell in the basement of Steve's conveniently remote country home. Steve real name Brendan is a cannibal. But that's not the worst of it market forces are a bitch even in the human flesh demimonde, and if there are no clean hands under capitalism, then we can't really blame ol' Steve for finding his economic niche, which is procuring the flesh of women for wealthy cannibal clients. It's a high-end business with a personal touch each cut of meat is vacuum-sealed for freshness and packaged with a photo of the victim, a biography, and some personal items of clothing. And to make sure he's selling only the freshest cuts, he keeps his victims alive for as long as possible as he sections off their bodies piece by piece. Noa needs to keep her wits about her to turn the tables on Steve/Brendan but how far is she willing to go? Directed by Mimi Cave, here making her feature film debut, from a script by Lauryn Kahn, Ibiza (2018), Fresh contains echoes of plenty of other films and series the central dilemma is not a million miles away from Rob Reiner's Misery (1990), the cordon blue cannibal culture stuff can't help but reference Bryan Fuller's Hannibal (2013-15), and there's a hint of Dexter (2006-13) in the film's playful approach to body horror (and for fans of the novels, the image of the ""yodeling potato"" comes to mind when contemplating what Steve's victims must look like deep into the process of butchery). It's also useful to compare the 2022 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which elided the cannibalism of its source material but upped the gore. Here, the horror is mostly (not completely, mind you) bloodless, and Cave works wonders with implication rather than in-your-face grand Guignol gore. It's queasily transgressive; forget Earthling, this might be the most effective pro-vegan movie ever made. The plot is a serviceable enough race-against-time with some clever twists and variations on the theme as Noa's BFF Mollie (Jonica T. Gibbs) tries to track down her whereabouts (shades of 2017's Get Out), but what really impresses is the way Fresh strips"
69,MEU_Doc10_Fresh,MEU_Doc10_Fresh,MEU,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"A deliciously demented horror film that doesn't even begin to let you in on what it's really about until after its opening credits roll a whopping 30 minutes into its nearly two-hour runtime, Fresh offers a full-course meal that incorporates many genres, but manages to stay grounded and balanced thanks to its two lead performances including Sebastian Stan, who joins the great pantheon of charismatic yet despicable horror villains. Fresh starts with hors-d'oeuvres, presenting Daisy Edgar-Jones' Noa as she navigates the brutal, ruthless world of modern online dating, and the parade of terrible guys she meets. Just as hope seems lost, the appetizer arrives in the form of Stan's Steve, who is by all accounts the perfect guy funny, smart, caring, and also a doctor with the looks of, well, Sebastian Stan. Director Mimi Cave delays the inevitable reveal of Steve's true intentions as long as possible while exploring every rom-com trick in the book, from the meet-cute at the supermarket while discussing the merits of cotton candy grapes to talking about their families over a nice dinner. Cave manages to make the coupling of Noa and Steve believable, showing why she would fall head over heels for this guy and ignore all the obvious red flags. It is not until the salad and the fish have been served and consumed that Lauryn Kahn's script presents us with the opening credits and the light meal of crudites turns into a red-blood meat fest of a horror main course. Spending a quarter of the film's runtime on a typical rom-com with this couple makes the shoe drop hit harder, especially since Edgar-Jones and Stan have palpable chemistry together, and make it really easy to root for them. Edgar-Jones does a terrific job playing into the naive hopefulness, then the utter shock and horror of Noa, but like most films about psychopaths or abductions like Misery or American Psycho, Fresh belongs to the villain. Thankfully, Stan is more than up to the task, showing a side of him Marvel movies have deprived us of for years but is just starting to come off, between this and in Pam & Tommy: a dazzling, energetic psychopath who dances around the kitchen while oozing all kinds of perverse, charming energy. Far from Christian Bale's cold Patrick Bateman, Steve is approachable and chivalrous, equal parts knight in shining armor and absolute monster. Every new scene with him is an extra course to an already full meal. To help intensify the flavors of the big, fat, juicy steak that is Stan's performance and the second act of the film, Fresh brings out its secret sauce: Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography. Having already shown us the horrors of vacationing to Scandinavia in Midsommar, he turns his eyes toward giving Fresh an unsettling yet lush style that often offers extreme close-ups of Steve's handiwork like it was Eli Roth's Hostel without so much gore. The result is about the cleanest, grossest horror movie of the year so far, one with repulsive"

I don't understand the positive reviews and praise? This movie was terrible disgusting schlock. Also, a complete rip-off of Stephen King's Thinner which also a shitty movie. This was supposed to be a horror comedy? First of all this movie is neither scary or funny. They might as well called this jump scare the movie. Take a drink every time there a loud jump scare scene. There's an unnecessary scene where the main character stabs and kills her cat. She got what she deserved when she was dragged to hell at the end. Good riddance! The acting is horrible and dry. Alison Lohman is an awful actress. No wonder her acting career ended after she did this movie. Her line delivery is horrid. You never believe anything coming out of her mouth especially when she tries to act angry or swears. She sounds like she's reading off cue cards. She also lacks reaction to anything crazy going on around her. She pretty much ruined this movie for me with her bland emotionless performance. She had that same stupid blank worried face the entire movie. I just wanted to punch her in the face! I was rooting for the gypsy woman to kill her! Justin Long and Alison Lohman have zero chemistry and make for boring leads. I felt like they were both miscast. Justin Long felt outta place in this movie. He looked like belonged on set of Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer. He pretty much phoned in his performance as he slept walked all his scenes. The gypsy came off more hilarious than scary. Every scene with her was a joke! This movie is way over the top and just plain old disgusting. They're replacing suspense and horror with blood, guts, and potty humor. This movie basically Alison Lohman getting attack absurdly and nastily every 5 minutes. This movie is full of gross. Burping up a fly, dentures flying out of mouths, old lady sucking on people's chins, vomiting bugs and maggots in somebody's mouth, bloody nose squirting blood everywhere, shoving arms don people's throats, possessed talking goat spouting profanities, spooky flying handkerchief's. None of this is scary or funny. Just childish, cheesy and stupid. If this wasn't made by Sam Raimi it would have gotten negative reviews and trashed by fans and critics. This movie sucked! Forgettable characters you don't care about, not scary, not funny, bad acting, dull plot, repetitive fake out scenes, gross out humor, lack of a musical score. It's is one of the most overrated horror films in the last couple of years. Sorry fans, this crap has nothing the on Evil Dead films. Those films were classics. This garbage is forgotten tripe. Simply the worst movie I have ever seen and it is definitely the worst of the decade. Then again, given that he directed the stupid Spiderman movies, shouldn't"

His Spiderman films started off pretty good (although a little crazy on the CGI), but got boring. So with Drag Me To Hell, he's taking another shot at Horror. A shot that missed completely. I don't know what his intentions were with this film entirely, but it seemed to me like it was trying to take itself seriously as a horror/thriller, but had quite a bit of comedic undertone that came off as a back-up plan in case it didn't end up as horrific as he had hoped. Maybe he didn't know what he wanted out of this film. Regardless, the confusion is clear. The plot is there, but nothing you really need to think about. There are no real twists and turns, save for one that was totally predictable along with all the """"jumpy"""" parts. The whole idea that this gypsy put a curse on this girl, as well as a young boy in the beginning is uninteresting as well. When an elderly gypsy woman puts a curse on someone, I'd be more interested in an in-depth tale of revenge rather than a stolen necklace and being denied another mortgage loan by a girl who's just doing her job. And the handkerchief creature of doom? That screeches as she steps on it? You've got to be kidding me. If you're going to do that kind of stuff, you shouldn't take ANY of the movie seriously. That would make an entertaining Horror film! But reviews I've read go on about how """"horror has finally returned"""" and even Sam Raimi talked about how working on Evil Dead was a nightmare as he was constantly covered in fake blood and puss. Then don't make horror movies, you big baby! That kind of stuff is the BEST part of working on a horror movie! Now look at you, hiding behind the computer relying on CGI to please the retard movie-goers of today. I will also add that the actress did a horrible job. Although she would have done it perfectly, had the director gone gung-ho Comedic Horror like he should have. If you're going to say that it was totally not meant to be taken seriously, I repeat how many reviews I've read raving about how """"horror has returned"""", and I would also like to point out how no one in the theatre was laughing appropriately, save for those who were laughing along with me at how bad it was. I knew within the first 30 minutes that I hated this movie. I felt like I was being dragged through the scenes as the girl was being haunted for 3 days, knowing everything that was going to happen, and waiting impatiently for the unsatisfying events to occur. Worst. Movie. Ever. Damn. there is no zero rating. do not believe the ratings about this being a good film. Unless, of course, your idea of a good"

Shouldn't have used the word """"great."""" Let me try again: This was not, I repeat, NOT a good movie. Ahhhh, that's better. I like Sam Raimi's work enough although I'm not a very big fan. I really think he enjoys a semi-cult-like popularity that leads some folks here to close their eyes on the many flaws and write positive reviews about this weak Raimi offering. There are several very big problems here. The main one starts with the unconvincing performance of Alison Lohman playing the protagonist Christine Brown. I have not seen her in a lot of movies but if I have, her work must have been as forgettable as this one. Miss Lohmann comes off as a B-actress with very little range here. In many scenes I could have sworn they had just called her to the set as soon as she was done memorizing her lines. Those lines came out of her mouth just like a junior-high student trying to pass an oral exam by only memorizing from the text book instead of actually learning the topic. Miss Lohman should not take all the blame for this, though. Her character is so unbelievable that when she has her first sequence of violent spirit activity in her residence she merely shuts a door and goes back to her normal life. After the third or fourth such evil-spirit violence she calms down enough to go out with her boyfriend and talk about how nice a night it is! The writing is very weak and feels rushed. As if the script was written in one Saturday afternoon. The dialogs are so lame that I'm not sure if even Meryl Streep could have made lemonade out of it. Justin Long who does a good job in those MAC commercials looks like he is having a hard time keeping a straight face with this script. To be fair the individual set pieces are somewhat effective and in a couple of occasions even somewhat scary. But this is far too rare here. The Cheapest way filmmakers try to scare you is with gore-galore. The second cheapest, in my opinion, is when you are give sudden loud """"scare"""" scenes designed to make you jump from your seat. While Mr. Raimi keeps the gore to a reasonable level he profusely relies on sudden shock shots to scare you. Ah yes, there's a third cheapest scare tactic and it's not so much a scare tactic as it is a make-you sick tactic. Bloody vomit is really passe but Mr. Raimi does not let that bother him. He also serves us saliva-soaked yellowed dentures, corpse vomit and a host of other yuks. That stuff worked for """"The Exorcist"""" because it never felt like the director was feeding it to us just because he could. It does feel that way here.

Is that supposed to be original in some way? Why is it that gypsies always have the power to kill people and curse people to death but can't seem to pay their bills on time or go to the dentist? This movie made me realize that Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time. He's made one half-decent movie, The Evil Dead. The other two in the Evil Dead series were totally stupid, with a couple of funny lines that caught on in the cult film world. Evil Dead 3 was total garbage. People want to make the Evil Dead series more than what it is, which is just plain bad. Spiderman sucked as well. Anyway, back to this piece of crap. So this gypsy lady with a very fake accent can't pay her bills, even though she has a clan of relatives who appear later on at her house having a party. Her false teeth fall out, but when she goes to put them back in, you can see the actress's REAL TEETH right before the cut. Then, after stealing a bowl of candy, she begs for a break on her loan even though she's already proved herself to be a deadbeat and an actress with a really terrible fake accent. So who's fault is that? The loan officer, of course. And she deserves to die for doing the right thing! And this is basically the outline for this horrible pathetic excuse for a horror movie. Then, the Mexican lady wants a shot at the demon. She's been waiting to confront it for many many years. It's been her life long goal to confront the demon that is now after the loan officer. She will risk her life to get this demon, and wants to be paid 10,000 dollars to do it! What? If she wanted the demon so bad why not do it for free? This sets up the totally stupid and done a thousand times holding hands around a table and then the floating dancing guy during comedic music (evil dead crap.) So that doesn't work and suddenly the Indian guy tells her to give the button to someone else. Why NOW? Why not when he first found out about the stupid button curse did he not reveal this tidbit of info and save a few lives in the process? And what happened during the nose bleed scene? When blood shoots 30 feet out someone's nose, coating the room and a few people in blood, do you call an ambulance or act like the person had a paper cut? Oh, let's not forget the constant shooting of various liquids into the loan officer's mouth. Constantly. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE!

Pick a quiet room and take turns sitting with your back to the drums. Have the other friend randomly smash the cymbals and drums every few minutes for an hour and a half. Startled much? Congratulations, you've just watched Drag me To Hell, or at least felt what it was like to sit through it. For scares, that is quite literally all this movie has to offer. There is absolutely no subtlety to the horror. Instead of taking what could have been a movie with a rich lore and storyline, Sam Raimi chose to make Drag me To Hell into a """"jumpfest"""" that relies on lots of overly loud music and sound effects. Sam, things that are loud are not scary - like jet engines - they are simply obnoxious. And for that matter, rusty gates that are creaking, and annoyed goats do not even have the capacity to be as loud as a jet engine. Did you know that, Sam? Apparently not. Initially, the PG-13 rating was a red flag for me, but I thought, it's Sam Raimi doing another horror film. I should trust him. Perhaps it's more psychological than anything else. After all, it is about an evil spirit that terrorizes its victim for three days before it takes them to hell. What an opportunity for a smart horror film! Sadly, my trust was misplaced. This movie tries to get some of its scares from gore, but ultimately fails, because it's PG-13 Gore. It's pretty easy to watch and pick out the parts that should have been R, but were obviously toned down to keep a more summer friendly audience in the seats. Too bad, really. Most of the effects end up coming off as fake, and oddly enough, done with CG when they did not need to be. Like when Christine gets dead old lady gunk splattered on her face in the shed. How hard is it to just splatter someone in the face with what looks like dead old lady gunk? Ultimately it all felt like a rehash of some old concepts from Sam's Bruce Campbell heyday(Christine wrestles with an evil handkerchief much like Ash wrestled with his evil hand). Unfortunately there is no Bruce Campbell to be found, and the handkerchief is done in CG(how hard is it to just hand someone a handkerchief and say, """"Wrestle!""""). Like everything else in the movie, it just comes off as lame. And in case you were wondering if the plot is a ripoff of Steven King's """"Thinner"""" - yes. Yes it is.

I stayed until the end just so I could have the right to blast it on this site. THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER"

Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver. Christine (Lohman), a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend (Long), is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity, she comes across an old gypsy woman (Raver) who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss (Paymer) tells her it's a tough decision, and its her call, so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated, the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse, one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell. Lucky enough to have won tickets to a pre-screening of the film, I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise, the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny, they can go overboard, but not this one. In fact, I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II. Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film, Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways, this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG-13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense, scary horror films in quite some time, despite the PG-13 rating which many tag as already crap. Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks, and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know, but that would truly ruin some of its appeal.

The 1981 horror classic featured everything a good horror movie is supposed to be: scary, gory, at times weirdly funny, and entertaining. When I saw """"The Evil Dead,"""" I wondered if Raimi would ever return to horror again. 2009's """"Drag Me To Hell"""" is the answer that was given. Raimi has finally gotten a chance to leave the """"Spiderman"""" franchise and actually do something that old fans would remember him by. There's only three words to describe """"Drag Me To Hell"""" and those words are: A PERFECT MOVIE! Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a woman who is living a happy life with her boyfriend Clay, and she has a great job at the bank. But when an old gypsy woman, Sylvia Ganush, comes to Christine, begging for another extension on her mortgage payment, Christine is faced with a challenging decision. Will she impress her boss and win the assistant manager position or will she help Mrs. Ganush out and never be able to make tough decisions? Christine goes for the first choice. Bad mistake, because Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on Christine. It is the curse of the Lamia, a furious demon that tortures its victims for three days until it finally drags you to hell to burn for eternity. Can Christine be able to find a way to stop the curse before it's too late? Despite its PG-13 rating, """"Drag Me To Hell"""" is a superior horror film with nonstop scares, gratuitous gross-out moments, a very dark sense of humor, and it's fun to watch. Raimi doesn't just put Christine through hell, but he does it with the audience too. I was jumping in my seat so many times, talking to the screen, and I actually felt my adrenaline pumping, stuff that hasn't happened to me in a long time in a horror movie. It makes you remember classic horror film rules: If a disgusting gypsy woman with bad dentures, a blind eye, leper fingernails and endless phlegm coming out of her mouth needs your help, you don't ignore her. You help that woman out! There are plenty of slashers and haunted house movies, but there aren't so many people getting cursed. Raimi's horrific story is just a little bit formulaic, but he takes it and makes it his own. Gypsy curses have never been this violent or scary. The cast obviously had a good time making the movie because their performances are awesome. I really enjoyed watching Alison Lohman play Christine. I haven't watched a lot of her movies, but this one shows that she's very underrated and deserves bigger roles. Great job, Lohman!

Scary scary movies ahead of their time. But over time Sam moved away from the horror genre and directed films like Darkman and the Spider-Man trilogy. If he wasn't doing that he pasted his name on and produced really really bad horror movies like The Boogeyman. So imagine my surprise when i heard that he was actually directing a horror movie again! After seeing it last night here is my review. I do enjoy horror films......but i don't like them. That doesn't make sense but what i mean is i LOVE horror movies but all horror movies today are utter crap. The only scary movies made today are all Korean. Then America, with their complete lack of originality and money grabbing ways, make a remake with low standards. The last horror movie i went to see was The Unborn and that is THE WORST MOVIE i have seen in a long time and the worst horror movie as well. Drag Me To Hell is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. In the films opening sequence the plot device is introduced in a chilling manner. It opens the film perfectly and the goosebumps go all the way through the opening credits. Christine has a fairly nice life until she denies an elderly woman an extension on her mortgage. Then the main part of the plot is opened in a sequence that is tongue in cheek funny and scary (classic raimi). From here on out it's scares piled upon scares. Sam Raimi doesn't follow the usual horror movie cliche of.........long......drawn-out......silences.....THEN LOUD NOISE TO MAKE YOU JUMP! He actually builds suspense with a neat little musical score. High pitched violins carry your nerves then throw them in the air! That's another thing. The film doesn't have a great focus on visual effects but the sound effects are fantastic. Tension building and atomospheric sounds and music are put to amazing use. The story is a good set up. It is an original film with an original story. It isn't plagerised or a cheap money making remake from Korea. Although the story is limited and the film run time is of average length. The film is classic Raimi and there are lots of references to other films by him. It's good to know that super massive Hollywood blockbusters haven't diluted his great direction and how he used to make films all those years ago. He keeps a good balance of humour and serious scenes by using humour when necessary and never ruining the atmosphere. Throw all this in with a disturbing shock ending you have the best horror film i've seen at the cinema in a long time! I'm sure you'll agree. Enjoy. For those of you old enough to recall watching ""The Evil dead"" when you were a cub, you might remember what a scary and traumatic experience that might have been. I could"

Drag Me to Hell is not only the best horror movie but also one of the best and most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. This was a pleasant surprise to horror fans like me who are sick of excessive darkness and gore. Actually, I find most such movies to be disturbing rather than scary. What's so enjoyable about seeing someone's guts hang from their stomach? Drag Me to Hell manages to scare you without using gore or dark scenes. It is the nice mixture of elements than makes it scary. The story line is smooth,there are no plot holes, the heroine is absolutely likable and innocent-looking, you are engaged with the movie and feel her torment, the background music is very creepy, there are plenty of sudden jumps and scares, there is very good use of common items and elements that makes them look terrifying, there are a few ironic moments in the film to give you a break, and the ending is totally unpredictable and leaves you in a state of shock, fear and despair. All in all, it was full of jumps and thrills throughout. What more could I possibly expect from a horror movie? It was just perfect. I am very up set with the people who write negative comments for a movie like this. they don't have sense. Don't listen to anyone with negative comments on this title. Watch it and you will enjoy it for the next of your life. Its really more then an excellent movie. I am a real hardcore horror fan. so don't get it wrong. I have never seen a movie like that in my life Wrong Turn series, Hostels, Saws, are good But this one is excellent. for sure. go for it and you will be jumping in your seat. if you want to really enjoy it just watch it in a dark room in the night if possible, alone and if possible turn on your headphones to listen. and you will not be disappointed. Seriously, this guy is a god. I love all his films, including The Evil Dead Series, Darkman, Spiderman Films, and now this is added. I don't care if you love him or hate him, He IS my favorite director, ever. Drag me to Hell is very good. I recommend this film. You'll love it as much as a fat kid loves Cake. Trust me. I saw this on theaters, and everyone, including myself, left with a big smile on our faces. We all ever applaud for a while, until the securities told us to leave.

Going back to his roots in horror, Raimi directs this film with the precision of the Evil Dead films, only this is much scarier than either of those films. And, to top that off, Sam Raimi uses his typical tongue in cheek style, that was largely missing from the first two Spiderman films, but all too present in the third, and he uses just the right amount here, never going extremely over the top, but reaching close many times. Really, this is the best horror film that's been released in years. Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) is a loan officer who really wants that new promotion from her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer). But her competition for the promotion is the new guy, a notorious kiss-up, Stu (Reggie Lee). In order to curry her bosses favor, she turns down an old woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), on her third mortgage for her home. Ganush ends up putting a gypsy curse on her that causes her to see a shadowy figure that beats her up and shakes up all the pots and pans and such. After going to a psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), she finds that she has a curse that will drag her to hell in three days. Chaos ensues as she tries to beat this thing, and as her educated boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) begins to see her mentally deteriorating. This movie has more jump scenes than most horror films do, but these one's actually catch you off guard. In a few scenes, Raimi tries to build the tension, and you know a scare is coming, but in many other scenes there is no way of knowing when something will strike the screen and your heart will start racing. Knowing that horror is better with a pinch of salt, Raimi adds humor throughout the film. The scares are genuine, but the action scenes are usually very funny. This includes random blood squirting, mucus jokes, and a running joke of gumming to the face. And to add to the humorous horror, there is funny dialogue also. It's really an excellent mixture. The performances were spot on. Allison Lohman plays her performance as a nice girl well, but also manages to portray the characters dark sides. Justin Long is convincing as the boyfriend who is losing faith, but constantly convincing himself that his girlfriend isn't crazy. Dileep Rao as the psychic is great. An actor who was surprisingly amusing was Reggie Lee as the kiss-up co-worker, and he really provides quite a few laughs, despite an over the top performance. The final touch on the film is the musical score. This had a really pretty score by Christopher Young. It's probably supposed to sound like gypsy music, led by a violin, and as a stand alone score it's still good for a listen. Overall,"

It's sleek and trim and black, a gleaming automotive manifesto in dark steel and fiberglass that howls of speed and power. Standing still, it looks as if it's going 150 miles an hour. There's only one problem. It's always standing still. It has no motor. Alas, neither does the movie. Lavish and beguiling, even radical in conception, ""Batman"" just sits up there drinking money and serving as a platform for Jack Nicholson's campaign to win an Academy Award nomination. Nicholson is huge; why wasn't the movie called ""Joker""? When it's over you're thinking, Batmho? The movie occupies that curious and unsettling middle ground between parody and un-self-conscious pulp vitality, being neither wholly one nor the other. It's halfway between an opera and a comic book, but it chooses the worst parts of each. It hasn't the comic book's antic rhythms, but it hasn't an opera's depth of passion. Its unsureness of tone is certainly most vividly expressed in Michael Keaton's muted, even wan, performance as Bruce Wayne, the socialite by day who becomes Batman, avatar of vengeance and justice, by night. Or does he? One signal flaw in the film is its inability to link Wayne and Batman in convincing ways. Wayne is a meek, mild and not very interesting young man in wire-frame glasses: when he goes to bed with Kim Basinger after 34 seconds of souffle-light repartee, you can't begin to figure out what she sees in him. But in his Batgear, his body expands grotesquely and he kicks butt left and right with a physical authority that is exhilarating. But his most salient feature is those sad and haunted eyes that gleam darkly out from under the Batcowl: they're the eyes of a man who's overcome tragedy, who In Hemingway's words has been broken by "" the world, mended and is strongest in the mended places. You Just can't believe Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same guy it's not merely the physical dissimilarity as it is the psychological. There's nothing to Wayne to suggest the deep well of neurosis and pain that could create the strain of vigilan-tism known as Batculture; why didn't he turn into Charles Bronson and just buy a Beretta? Why did he evolve the intricate system of vengeance, survival and complete denial of real-selfprojection of fantasy-self that is the core of Bathood? With little opposition, then, Nicholson simply expands until there's very little room left in the film. I suppose it's a great performance, but it's so overweight that it causes the film to lose course completely. His Joker face bleached of color after a dousing in a vat of industrial waste, mind drained of rationality by the same experience becomes a large-scale, self-styled homicidal artist, and, with his vivid gang of thugs, wheels around Gotham City causing violent mischief. But another grotesque failure of the film is that it fails to give the Joker a caper, which"
81,MKW_Doc2_Batman,MKW_Doc2_Batman,MKW,Action,Positive,Batman,"Here's the news from Gotham City: The hype is not overblown and the casting controversies are blown away. Tim Burton's Batman is spectacular entertainment, as exciting as it is visionary, and as much fun ""as it is darkly original. Michael Keaton stars as a credible and complex caped crusader, and Jack Nicholson is the wonderfully wild Joker, an appropriately over-the-top mythical villain who -leaps off the screen like the boldly drawn comic book character that inspired him. Both characters play out a dark fable that is part comic book and part opera, entangled in an evil, overgrown, dementedly art deco urban world, brilliantly created by -production designer Anton Furst. , The film combines Depression Era gloom and grit with a cynical future somewhat like an East Coast variation of Blade Runner. (Furst's work is so startling and so evocative that the designer must be counted among the most important stars of Batman.) The script by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren weaves together the story of the beginnings of the -so-called Dark Knight and the Joker, with a later encounter between the long-time comic book enemies. Unlike the recent theatrical Superman series, which told the background story in drawn-out linear style, the Batman evolution is cleverly detailed through flash-backs as the psychological underpinnings for each character's behavior today. As portrayed by Keaton, the wealthy Bruce Wayne is a quiet, emotionally distraught man who has never forgotten the night he witnessed the murder of his two parents. He finds relief from his anguish only by putting on the attire of Batman, and going out in the Gotham night to corral criminals. Though some have questioned the selection of comedian-actor Keaton as Batman, the choice wisely underscores the ""everyman"" aspect of the Bruce Wayne character, and makes his transformation into Batman more dramatic. (Batman, it should be remembered, is the only comic book superhero with no superhuman traits. He uses only ingenuity, athleticism, and courage to combat evil-doers.) The Joker, on the other hand, is a former gangster underling whose face is forever distorted into an ominous grin when he's thrown into a vat of acid. Thus deformed, he makes it a goal to achieve ven-gence through murderous schemes that leave his victims with the same ghastly grin. The role calls for crazed behavior, and Jack Nicholson delivers in spades. Given the opportunity nay, the responsibility to create a comic book character of great energy and lunacy, Nicholson vi- Tim Burton Michael Keaton brates across the screen like a man possessed. It's an explosive performance of unrestrained wit and dementia. The two men who dominate the film are given impressive support from Kim Basinger, as Vicki Vale, the news photographer who falls for Bruce Wayne, and who exists as a sort of sea of normality amid the craziness of the film; and from Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance, and especially Michael Gough, who has a nice British turn as Wayne's loyal man-servant. Some have argued that Batman belongs to"
82,MKW_Doc3_Batman,MKW_Doc3_Batman,MKW,Action,Positive,Batman,"Created 50 years ago as a comic book hero, the character of Batman has provided the basis for numerous television and film projects as well. Through the years he has evolved into a cartoon, especially in the high camp TV series of the 1960s. The dark side of the character has now been restored in the new Warner Bros. film Batman. Produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber, this Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset.The screenplay by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren (story by Hamm), based on characters created by Bob Kane for DC Comics, presents Batman as a menacing, mysterious figure and not as a hero of the people, in spite of the fact that his actions are against Gotham City's criminal elements. City officials, however, are not sure of his motives and disapprove of his vigilante approach to crime fighting. The script also explores the motivation behind the character and the psychological torment of Bruce Wayne and why he has taken on the disguise. The major strength of the film is actually its surrealistic visual style, which creates a disturbing portrait of a decaying society without structure or purpose. Production designer Anton Furst has created a Gotham City that is a dark, steaming cesspool, littered with waste and evolved as a jumble of almost every architectural style since the beginning of civilization. It is a place where it is most believable that a menace such as The Joker could seduce and possibly control the city. Contrasting this majestic visual concept is a quiet, but equally intense, human drama in which two people are trying to get together and make it in a basically hostile world. This is the uniqueness and very soul of the film and it is achieved through the beautifully defined and probing performances of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, a news photographer who is intrigued by both Wayne and Batman. Keaton delivers an especially impressive and deeply nuanced characterization as Wayne. When he takes on the Batman disguise, he becomes an enigmatic, robot-like figured without human personality. At the other end of the spectrum is Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker. It is difficult to imagine any other actor performing this character as well. And Nicholson, in white makeup with his face frozen into a menacing grimace, plays it to the hilt. The actor goes over the edge as only he can do and his performance works perfectly. Jack Palance is fun in his brief appearance as a crime czar and Michael Gough is excellent as Wayne's fatherly butler. Other performances including Robert Wuhl as a reporter and Pat Hingle and Billy Dee Williams as city officials are effective, although basically overshadowed by the production itself. New York Mayor Ed Koch has an amusing unbilled"
83,MKW_Doc4_Batman,MKW_Doc4_Batman,MKW,Action,Negative,Batman,"As its trailer has already hinted, ""Batman"" (citywide) is very much a movie and a hero for the '80s. Is it interesting? Fitfully. Is it fun? Not much, Gotham City fans, not much. It's a murky, brooding piece, set in a twisted city almost choked with evil and inertia, and Bruce Wayne, half of its hero's dual identities, is very nearly in the same fix. Driven to right a naughty world the best that one man can, he's withdrawn, cerebral, severely absent-minded. As director Tim Burton sees him, he's practically the Hamlet of millionaire philanthropist socialites. When he puts on his Batmuscles and his Bathat, his Batjock, his Batgauntlets and his world heavyweight's Batbelt, almost nothing is left of him but glitteringly blue-gray eyes and a voluptuously full mouth. If a costume alone could stop crime, this one would, since it almost stops Michael Keaton. In the opposite corner, wearing purple satin, clown white, green hair and a permanent rictus, is the picture's big noise, the Joker, the dirtiest trickster since G. Gordon Liddy. Never still for a millisecond, Jack Nicholson's Joker preens and prances, drum major for a squad of sociopaths, detonating his noxious jokes like cherry bombs. (""You're insane!"" Joker: ""I thought I was a Pisces."") Director Burton has sensibly turned his back on the camp of the '60s ""Batman"" TV series, and has drawn his menacing atmosphere from the Gotham City of ""Batman's"" creator, Bob Kane. Burton read his audience right in that respect. And with the production designs of Anton Furst (""The Company of Wolves,"" ""Full Metal Jacket"") and Danny Elfman's darkly enveloping score, he has a shiveringly dense and poetic city against which to set his characters. Unfortunately, the screenplay, credited to both Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren from Hamm's story and Kane's characters, doesn't give those characters a fighting chance. It flops about, unsure of which of its scarred protagonists it finds the most seductive, and it's disastrously low on the sort of wit that can make a gargantuan movie lovable. The movie's first half hour is a thicket of exposition, yet it never answers a few basic Batquestions in every mind. The Joker we learn almost everything about: his plans to take over first the girlfriend (Jerry Hall), then the chair of crime lord Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Batman, his savvy butler Alfred (the estimable Michael Gough) and the Batgadgets remain annoyingly uninvestigated. So does the moment when Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale notices it's Bruce Wayne fiddling away in that Batcave. So Bruce Wayne was traumatized by witnessing the murder of his parents when he was 9, and that has led him into this double life of midnight vigilantism. Why bats? Wherefore bat caves? The fact that he's mortal makes him especially fascinating, yet the movie (and that Batrig) never lets us worry for a second that anything can happen to him. The volatile Keaton, an extremely interesting casting choice if he had a chance to let some of his dangerousness out, remains"
84,MKW_Doc5_Batman,MKW_Doc5_Batman,MKW,Action,Negative,Batman,"Critics adored Batman for its eccentric, Burtonesque take on a pop-culture icon, for its moody, noirish gothic art-deco Gotham City, and of course for Nicholson's showy performance. Comic-book fans, meanwhile, appreciated the film for rescuing the Dark Knight from the over-the-top camp comedy of the 1960s series and making him suitably dark and brooding. For all that, though, the film's flaws are hard to overlook. The story is a mess. To start with, the love affair of Bruce Wayne (Keaton) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) has no substance or emotional resonance. Bruce and faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) are constantly reminding one another how ""special"" Vicki supposedly is, though she's done little to show it, unless you count sleeping with Bruce after their awkward first date. (Peter Parker and Mary Jane's romance in the original Spider-Man is also shallow, but at least MJ is sweet and Peter is credibly smitten. Bruce and Vicki have no chemistry as well as no relationship.) Scenes and lines of dialogue make no sense. Take the bit where Bruce Wayne, protected only by a small metal tray under his shirt, gets jiggy with the gun-wielding Joker when the latter bursts in on Vicki's apartment. Forget the absurdity of relying on a book-sized tray as a bulletproof vest what's the point of Bruce's actions? What's he trying to accomplish? What's the point of the Joker's ""Who do you trust?"" PR campaign against Batman, as if the two of them were running for mayor? This theme makes sense when it recurs in the Burton-directed sequel, Batman Returns, where the Penguin (Danny DeVito) really is running for mayor, but in the original it feels like a private issue of Burton's that's been imposed on the story for no reason. (That the Joker is crazy is not a sufficient explanation. As depicted in this film, the Joker is an ""artist""; he may be bizarre and sociopathic, but his actions are never simply irrational or pointless.) Then there are sloppy little things. When Bruce asks Vicki on their first date whether she had ""any trouble finding the place,"" it's meant to be funny because Wayne Manor is presumably a major Gotham landmark but the movie seems to have forgotten that Vicki was just at his place for the big cocktail party. Then there's the bit in the newsroom with Vicki and reporter Knox (Robert Wuhl) musing about who Bruce Wayne really is, how there's ""nothing in his file... no photos, no history, nothing."" Hello? Nothing on Bruce Wayne, millionaire playboy? That's like saying they have nothing on Donald Trump or Paris Hilton. Then there's the depiction of Batman himself, starting with the casting of Keaton, hardly anyone's idea of an action hero. Years later, when the director was briefly attached to the long-delayed Superman movie project now in development by Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2), Burton made an even odder casting call, tapping Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel. Such eccentric choices seem to bespeak not just creative quirkiness, but"
85,MKW_Doc6_Batman,MKW_Doc6_Batman,MKW,Action,Positive,Batman,"Dark, haunting and poetic, Tim Burton's ""Batman"" is a magnificent living comic book. From its opening shots, as the camera descends into the grim, teeming streets of Gotham City, the movie fixes you in its gravitational pull. It's an enveloping, walk-in vision. You enter into it as you would a magical forest in a fairy tale, and the deeper you're drawn into it, the more frighteningly vivid it becomes. Ultimately, that's what ""Batman"" is -- a violent urban fairy tale. And it's as rich and satisfying a movie as you're likely to see all year. But though it springs from American pulp origins and provides comic book pleasures, it expands upon them as well, transmuting the raw material into operatic gold. Burton's pop vitality and his ability to make the world over in surreal cartoon terms could have been predicted from ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" and ""Beetlejuice,"" but nowhere in those films is there a sign of the muscularity and emotion he shows here. Photographed by Roger Pratt, the movie is visually symphonic, with layers and layers of detail and color. Gotham City itself is both recognizable and alien, an imaginative extension of contemporary urban chaos. Anton Furst's sets have a post-Industrial Age grandeur. The buildings are heavy and squat; they're monumental examples of urban rot. Clearly, the movie's Gotham is meant to be a nightmare variation on present-day New York City. (It even has Ed Koch and David Dinkins stand-ins, played by Lee Wallace and Billy Dee Williams.) As its 200th-birthday celebration approaches, it is in the grip of a brutal crime wave, orchestrated by Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), the boss of bosses, and his head henchman, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). In his stylish threads, Napier is the most dapper of the crooks, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by Grissom's moll, Alicia (Jerry Hall), who's two-timing the capo with his lieutenant. Batman and the Joker are essentially each other's creations. The Caped Crusader brings his arch-rival to life by letting Napier slip from his grasp into a vat of toxic chemicals. What emerges from the ooze is a macabre caricature of Jack Napier. Billing himself as ""the world's first fully functioning homicidal artist,"" the Joker is an incarnation of all the indiscriminate psychopaths who kill for the sheer, exhilarating fun of it. Defacing old masters and beautiful women with equal panache, the Joker takes riotous pleasure in his evil-doing. Nicholson, too, seems to be having a blast, and he brings a sense of dangerous hilarity to the character. Dressed in lurid lavender suits with orange silk shirts and aquamarine ties, he plays his green-haired trickster as a prancing, camp maniac. Beneath the Joker's killer jokes, though, the violence is palpable. Nicholson's acting here is dexterous, dancerly; physically, he's a wild-man combination of Barrymore, Baryshnikov and Jackie Gleason. Ogling a picture of the famous photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) -- who becomes Wayne's girlfriend -- he hisses, ""She could put steam in a man's strides."" This may be the"

It's a shame something more memorable doesn't happen there. ""Batman"" is a triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about. All of the big moments in the movie are pounded home with ear-shattering sound effects and a jackhammer cutting style, but that just serves to underline the movie's problem, which is a curious lack of suspense and intrinsic interest. ""Batman"" discards the recent cultural history of the Batman character - the camp 1960s TV series, the in-joke comic books - and returns to the mood of the 1940s, the decade of film noir and fascism. The movie is set at the present moment, more or less, but looks as if little has happened in architecture or city planning since the classic DC comic books created that architectural style you could call Comic Book Moderne. The streets of Gotham City are lined with bizarre skyscrapers that climb cancerously toward the sky, held up (or apart) by sky bridges and stresswork that look like webs against the night sky. At street level, gray and anonymous people scurry fearfully through the shadows, and the city cancels its 200th anniversary celebration because the streets are not safe enough to hold it. Gotham is in the midst of a wave of crime and murder orchestrated by The Joker (Jack Nicholson), and civilization is defended only by Batman (Michael Keaton). The screenplay takes a bow in the direction of the origin of the Batman story (young Bruce Wayne saw his parents murdered by a thug and vowed to use their fortune to dedicate his life to crime-fighting), and it also explains how The Joker got his fearsome grimace. Then it turns into a gloomy showdown between the two bizarre characters. Nicholson's Joker is really the most important character in the movie - in impact and screen time - and Keaton's Batman and Bruce Wayne characters are so monosyllabic and impenetrable that we have to remind ourselves to cheer for them. Kim Basinger strides in as Vicky Vale, a famous photographer assigned to the Gotham City crime wave, but although she and Wayne carry on a courtship and Batman rescues her from certain death more than once, there's no chemistry and little eroticism. The strangest scene in the movie may be the one where Vicky is brought into the Batcave by Alfred, the faithful valet, and realizes for the first time that Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same person. How does she react? She doesn't react. The movie forgets to allow her to be astonished. Remembering the movie, I find that the visuals remain strong in my mind, but I have trouble caring about what happened in front of them. I remember an astonishing special effects shot that travels up, up to the penthouse of a towering, ugly skyscraper, and I remember the armor"
87,MKW_Doc8_Batman,MKW_Doc8_Batman,MKW,Action,Positive,Batman,"Holy Jack Nicholson! He provides whatever pow! blam! and splat! you'll find in ""Batman"" an otherwise dour 50th anniversary tribute that treats the Caped Crusader as if he were a tortured intellectual out of an Ingmar Bergman film. But just as Sean Connery alone would make ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" worth seeing, Nicholson's sizzling performance as the Joker is reason enough to catch the season's most ardently anticipated movie. Nicholson and Connery are the two most accomplished screen actors we've got, and room should be made among the presidents at Mount Rushmore to capture their features in stone. Ignoring the high-camp spirits of the 60s TV series, this very big-screen ""Batman "" takes place in a grim futuristic Gotham City that does for New York what ""Blade Runner '' did for Los Angeles which is not a lot. To be sure, muggers abound, but not much else of what makes New Yorkers content to endure it all. What keeps rich socialite-philanthropist Bruce Wayne in Wayne Manor is his determination to avenge the murder of his parents, which he witnessed as a 9-year-old boy. So by night he transforms himself into Batman (both parts splendidly played by Michael Keaton), the scourge of Gotham's apparently sizeable criminal class. Chief among them is megalomaniacal hood Jack Napier, transformed by a physical accident as horrific as Wayne's psychic scar into the Joker mastermind of crime. The mauve-clad Joker is not a very nice man. When his girlfriend assures him while he's primping before a mirror that he looks fine, he snaps back: ""I didn't ask"" He believes ""dumb people, shouldn't live here, "" and the whole town ""needs an enema."" He also does his own commercials and vandalizes the world's most beloved paintings at an art gallery. His ""theme song"" a quietly hilarious touch is Stephen Foster's ""Beautiful Dreamer."" The only thing he shares with Batman apart from their traumas is a pair of eyebrows so highly arched that they seem to be aspiring to heaven like the roofs of Gothic cathedrals. Batman has his Batcave, Batmobile, and Batwing aircraft... but no Robin. Instead, his sidekick has been thoroughly heterosexualized into Kim Basinger as photojournalist Vicki Vale, on assignment to the Gotham Globe, where reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) is smitten with her abundant charms. But he doesn't stand a chance against Wayne, once the troubled but socially committed millionaire begins courting her. And here ""Batman"" lets us down. Clearly in such comic-book escapades it's the recognition scene that counts; the moment say when Lois Lane realizes that her nerdish friend Clark Kent is really Superman. Unaccountably, this happens offscreen in ""Batman,"" so the schizophrenic Wayne-Batman subtext is totally muffed. But then the whole movie is slightly schizo.

While the timing of when Batman was made can often mean some of the effects it does use don't always hold up, that is a small price to pay for just getting to see all of what was actually constructed. Do yourself a favor and go look up the miniatures that were made just to get some sense of the artistry on display in every facet of the city. Not only are they completely convincing, but they remain darkly beautiful to look at. It all feels real, yes, but there is something more to it as well. Though not the most unrestrained of Burton's films, it still feels like we are getting a glimpse into a world that is not just a recreation of our own, but something with its own texture that feels like it had been dreamt up rather than rendered. There is a degree of it that is cartoonish and absurd that doesn't conflict with its darker notes. Rather, it enhances them as the grim moments of laughter can all easily be followed up with a sense that things are spiraling out of control. While the Oscars are not always the best barometer by which to measure the achievements of a film, the work of countless craftspeople getting recognized with the Academy Award for Best Art Direction could not have been more deserved. Though it remains a superhero film through and through without shying away from the particulars of the story, Batman feels more like Burton's magnificent Beetlejuice than anything else. It doesn't feel like we are watching a film where the director's name attached feels incidental and possibly irrelevant. You can see Burton's fingerprints and those of his collaborators on every frame. What now feels like a rarity in an industry where IP is often valued above craft was absolutely fundamental to every facet of the experience. Of course, one would be remiss not to discuss just how wonderful Nicholson is in the role. Though he is known for a whole host of great performances in everything from The Shining to The Departed where he really goes for it, there is still something uniquely chaotic about his embodiment of the Clown Prince of Crime. No scene ever feels like it is an excess even as he is doing the absolute most because of just how entertaining and unsettling he is to watch. The longer he wreaks havoc on the city, the more it feels like everything is beginning to crash into his orbit. It even reaches a point where many have felt that he overshadows Keaton. However, while Nicholson is absolutely the one taking more bonkers swings, that is very much by design. Keaton, with his subtle humor and"
89,MKW_Doc10_Batman,MKW_Doc10_Batman,MKW,Action,Negative,Batman,"Do not go looking for the belovedly wacky antics of TV`s Batman in the movie Batman. This gloomy adaptation from DC Comics is a curiosity piece buoyed by a tide of advance hype. Take away Jack Nicholson`s merrily manic turn as the Joker and there is little to go on beyond visual thrills for 130 long minutes. At least there`s a lot to look at in terms of production values. But when you find yourself paying more heed to the art deco-inspired murals than to the story line, this $40 million fantasy epic is in trouble. Michael Keaton is OK as the Caped Crusader for good in crime-infested Gotham City, but Raul Julia might have been a better choice. Out of his rubber Batman suit, which fits none too well around his neck, he is Bruce Wayne, an urbane fellow of fabulous wealth who can`t seem to lighten up. Compared to Adam West`s lighthearted, self-spoofing TV Batman, Keaton`s version is far from being a fun guy. Nor is this much of a fun movie, even considering the filmmakers` intent to return to the dark nature of the original characters created by cartoonist Bob Kane. A rapt audience at an advance screening saved its cheers for the Batmobile, a snazzy piece of machinery capable of instantly armoring and disguising itself. There are a handful of tepidly amusing lines, apart from the black humor load carried by Nicholson. The mood is bleak and the city is forebodingly dark when Batman intervenes in a scheme of industrial espionage. Villainous Jack Napier (Nicholson) winds up in a transmogrifying vat of chemicals and becomes the evil Joker. Since he is now ghoulish-looking, he wants to create other people in his image by poisoning deodorants, make-up and other cosmetics. Soon TV news announcers are appearing on camera with pimples and mussed hair. Luscious blonde Kim Basinger as photojournalist Vicki Vale tries to find the connection between Batman and his undisguised self, when she`s not taking pictures of the masked vigilante in action. The actress seems more caught up in the spirit of the piece than does Keaton. Director Tim Burton, whose only previous films are the hits Pee-wee`s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, doesn`t hold back on amazing hardware for Batman and awesome-looking sets of an undetermined time period, designed by Anton Furst. Yet, he forgets the essential element of suspense in prolonging the grudge match between the Joker and Batman. A sure sign of the filmmaker`s uncertainty is the fact that he blunts the effectiveness of the Joker by keeping him on-screen too long. The antic Nicholson becomes a drag while he defaces famous paintings in a museum. By the time he waltzes Vicki around the bell tower of a rickety cathedral, the movie has misplaced its energy and purpose. But Nicholson, dressed in garish purple and orange, is the most reliable actor in this big, bold, empty Batman. He is given the best lines and plays perversity as if he had a twisted grin in"

Roger Ebert, in particular, had an absolutely gushing review, in which he praised the film for being ""a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit."" Ebert is by all accounts a lovely human being, but every time I read something by him, I am reminded that he does not have the critical sense that God gave a roach. Even an insect that frolics in filth would be hard pressed to find any enjoyment in such a shiny, treacly, turkey of a film. Spielberg as director has found perhaps the perfect outlet for his glibness in this tale of precognitive saviors. The film grinds frictionlessly along, a remorselessly predictable blueprint for itself. Flawed hero, tragic backstory, clever chase scene, cleverer chase scene, cleverest chase scene, false antagonist, twist, real antagonist, reconciliation with perfectly domestic yet also spunky wife. Like the precogs, we can see it all coming and all going too; painful echoes of sentiment past sliding down our brainstems as we float weightlessly in an infinite vat of sentimental horseshit. The emotional core of the film is (you could predict it) the tragic backstory I mentioned. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a efficient no-nonsense police guy in the precrime unit, snooping out murders before they happen. Beneath his gruff exterior and Hollywood good looks, though, lurks a sadness; his 5-year old disappeared from a public pool. Anderton's marriage collapsed, and now he takes drugs (ooooh...dark) and watches 3-D home movies of his son and wife. His heart is tugged while watching them and our heart is tugged while watching him; it's a testament to the power of film and to ""complex human feelings"", in Ebert's words. Said complex human feelings being: hey, losing a kid that really sucks. If that happens to you, you've got to be deep, right? That is the extent of the film's character development; Anderton has no other discernible personality traits; nor does his wife. The film's stupid, by-the-numbers plot, it's utterly facile and familiar characters, are all supposed to be redeemed by dropping a murdered five-year old onto them from a great height. Before I had a kid myself, I found this sort of mindless, self-serving manipulation unpleasant. Now that I have a child of my own, who is actually a person rather than a trope, I find it even more detestable. At the end of the film, Anderton indignantly yells at his stupid standard-issue corrupt boss for manipulating his love for his child. Rarely have I seen a moment of such utterly clueless hypocrisy. The whole film is nothing but a giant machine designed to turn unearned pathos into critical bona fides. The closing scene with Anderton, where reunited with his now pregnant wife he touches her stomach, is a blindingly offensive capstone to a thoroughly offensive film, a smug reassuring"

This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen. This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control. Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which"

It's a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in ""red ball"" situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated ""Blade Runner"" setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of ""Minority Report,"" which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism.

The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter. There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be"

Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers. Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities. Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future. As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!"" Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication"

Dick, plays for most of its running time like a John Ashcroft wet dream, but in the last minutes it chickens out with an American Civil Liberties Union-approved ending full of pardons and second thoughts. Tom Cruise gives one of his most inconsistent and incoherent performances as Chief John Anderton of the elite Department of Pre-Crime in Washington, D.C., circa 2054. Just think of it: Murder has been banished from the nation's capital because the guilty are punished before their crimes are committed. At one time or another, Anderton is a bereaved father sobbing over his murdered child and a Toscanini of mumbo-jumbo hand gestures summoning future crime to virtual reality and then apprehending and imprisoning the criminals before they have committed the crimes. Then, lest the kids begin yawning during the tediously expository dialogue, Anderton turns into a superspeedy fugitive from justice outrunning, outwitting and outmuscling a horde of Pre-Crime troopers in the silliest chase scenes in movie history. Colleagues I respect and even admire have written rave reviews for Minority Report . My own minority report is that it stinks, and I would leave it at that if it were not for my embarrassing admiration for Mr. Spielberg's A.I.: Artificial Intelligence last year. ""Embarrassing"" only because I'm supposed to be a registered auteurist from way back. It is not that I am particularly disappointed in Mr. Spielberg for making Minority Report . I have been considerably less than enthralled by most of his films over the years, and yet I have always understood why mine was often a minority position on his career. Lately, some critics have been condescendingly describing him as a Kubrick without cojones , which is to overlook Kubrick's frequent descents into sentimentality and infantilism, however diluted with vinegar. At their best, though not necessarily most popular, both directors-Kubrick with The Shining (1980) and the first part of Full Metal Jacket (1987), Mr. Spielberg with Empire of the Sun (1987) and A.I. (2001)-have displayed an ability to confound their juvenile constituency with an expression of psychological maturity. By contrast, Minority Report sinks to the level of pornographically violent video games such as Grand Theft Auto, with some ghoulish surgery involving switched eyeballs guaranteed to titillate the tots. Indeed, the film's vaunted Pre-Crime technology ends up looking like little more than a peculiarly shaped pinball machine. The incongruities of mixing futuristic environments with defiantly retro costuming are supposed to be amusing. In this respect, the curious publicity campaign to promote Irish Russell Crowe-like rogue actor Colin Farrell as the new Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt heartthrob is sabotaged by the sanitized, American-accented version of Mr. Farrell in a vintage F.B.I. business suit circa 1950. I won't go into the holes in the plot, because Swiss-cheese narratives are supposedly part of the postmodern idiom, but I did wonder idly why Anderton seemed to lose interest"

One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelganger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them. Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it's set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a ""priori,"" developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called ""Pre-Cogs"" who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he's a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs. The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General's office who covets Anderton's job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who'll-do-it as the flawed hero (he's hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film's playing time to two hours plus. Mr. Cruise, who barely survived Vanilla Sky , one of the worst movies ever made, bares his teeth and pecs in a variation of the same role he played in that"

That makes it the opposite of ""Bad Company"" and ""Windtalkers."" Cruise stars as Detective John Anderton of the ""pre-crime"" unit in Washington, D.C. Pre-crime has cut the murder rate in D.C. to zero in the year 2054 by arresting the would-be killers before they commit the murder. Genetically-engineered ""pre-cogs"" can forsee the murders while floating in a futuristic think tank. These visions of future murders are picked up by skull-mounted censors and fed into a computer system which can display the images to law enforcement and judiciary officials who can quickly expedite the search and arrest warrants. It seems like a perfect system, but of course it is not, or we wouldn't have a movie. Something goes terribly wrong and a pre-cog image shows Anderton murdering a man he does not know 36 hours in the future. Anderton must escape arrest in order to prove his innocence. It is not easy to escape detection when there are cameras and retinal scanners on every corner. There are also little spider-like robots which can search buildings, scanning retinas to find fugitives. The retinal scans are creepy. Everywhere Anderton goes giant wall-mounted television screens blurt advertising messages aimed specifically at him, instantly accessing his history of purchases. This is all linked to the retinal scans. Although the film does have its share of action scenes combined with great special effects, it is more of a true science fiction film dealing with the social implications of technology. One action scene has Anderton leaping from one moving vehicle to another on the side of a very tall building. It is done with blue screens and digital animation, but it looks pretty impressive. Another stunt has Anderton and a pre-crime cop falling off a building with only a jet pack to prevent the two from falling to their doom. The film deals mainly with the concepts of free will versus fate. It also deals with the problem of corruption caused by too much power being controlled by too few people. The way that fate (determinism) is usually handled in films is simplistic and one-sided. This film gets into the issue a little deeper and it is more even-handed. The thesis advanced by the film (based on a short story by legendary sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, whose work inspired the movie ""Blade Runner"") is that if you know your fate, then you have a choice. If you don't know your fate, then you have no choice. Of course that means if you know your fate it is no longer your fate. Such contradictions are faced squarely in the film. In one scene, Anderton rolls a ball along a table top. When the ball falls off, it is instinctively caught by government investigator Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell of ""Hart's War""), who is very skeptical about the infallibility of the program.

Would you allow personal information to be collected and used by any organization (public or private) that paid for or required it? Would you place your fate and trust in the hands of the faceless servants of politicos looking to gain a few more votes for their campaign? Would you abandon the ageless, entirely human distinction of free will? Would you care? The answers to these questions have already begun to appear, and with our track record so far, it's not entirely farfetched to consider Minority Report as relevant a warning as 1984 or Brave New World. Steven Spielberg understands this, and the result is quite possibly his darkest, coldest, most socially pertinent, subversive, and reactionary film to date. In this regard, it's the perfect answer to the critics of A.I., who I am sure will comment on the perceived irony of successfully but unintentionally summoning Stanley Kubrick on the film immediately after his intentional and highly publicized attempt. But the atmosphere, tone, and subtext are merely the tip of the iceberg; the entire film is a gripping success. In 2054, the murder rate in Washington, D.C. has been reduced to zero. The reason is the establishment of the Department of Precrime, which analyzes the visions of three precognizant humans to stop murders before they happen. The Precogs (the trade term for the three psychics) can predict a murder to the second it will occur. The system is so effective that there has not been a murder in six years thanks to the work of people like department chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise). The federal government is preparing to bring the experiment to the national level, but before undertaking such an effort, the bureaucrats need to make sure there are no flaws with the system and send in one of their own, Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), to investigate. The officials of the department believe in the system, and even though Witwer doubts Anderton's capabilities to head the agency because of the loss of his son, he has strong supporters, particularly the director of Precrime Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow). That's all about to change when the Precogs predict that Anderton will kill a man within a few days. However, there is hope: Sometimes the Precogs disagree, and when that happens, the resulting vision is called the ""minority report."" The copy of the information is destroyed, but the original remains with the Precog who predicted ittypically Agatha (Samantha Morton), the most talented one. The story blends elements of noir and action against a science-fiction backdrop as Anderton tries to unravel the mystery of the crime he is about to commit and at the same time propelling himself into a series of events that may cause him to commit the crime in the first place. Anderton is on the run for the majority of the film, and as a result, we are"

It is adapted from a short story by one of the great sci-fi writers, Philip K. Dick (he wrote Blade Runner). Spielberg made Dick's short work into his lengthy 135 minute film by getting screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen to brighten up some of Dick's more paranoiac visions in their effort to make the film more universally appealing and easier for the public to comprehend. It asks the question, Could one trust the system to ever bring crime under complete control without one's freedoms usurped? By showing that it is impossible to always be sure an innocent person is not convicted of a crime, Spielberg's thought-provoking film challenges us to rethink how we as a country are handling our crime problem. He shows how an innocent person can be victimized by even a flawless mechanical system, as he emphatically states that we shouldn't trust our eyes alone to tell us what we see. It also shows how even if you knew a crime was to happen, there might be other factors that make even this visionary knowledge not enough to be conclusiveas there are always human factors to consider. The director is starting to get heavier in his films and is starting to take on the mantle of Stanley Kubrick, as he is looking more like this country's next resident film genius instead of the purveyor of pop culture some might have thought he would never let go of. He still does what he does best, tell a visually pleasing story, though his later scripts have become more poetical and less concerned with feeding the public their usual diet of pap. This film is less lyrical than A.I. and more given to ready-made explanations, but Spielberg's story is so strong and his visualizations are so refreshing that he can't really be faulted for some lingering flaws leftover from his past filmmaking. The film's weakest point was the so-so ending, which couldn't match the effectiveness of the films startling beginning when it presented its riveting premise by hunting down a potential killer and the action filled middle part where the cop is on-the-run. The story is set in 2054 in Washington, D.C., where a crime wave in homicides is stopped by a novel program called Pre-Crime. A Pre-Crime agency has been successfully established in the District of Columbia for the past six years and has stopped all murders since its inception. The director and founder is the elderly Lamar Burgess (Sydow), and the unit's chief of police is Burgess' hand-picked protege, John Anderton (Cruise).

Indeed, 22 Jump Street is another meta-comedy from directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, creators of the ultimate ""meta"" experience, this year's The LEGO Movie. Self-awarealmost certainly to a faultof the diminishing quality and increasing absurdity when it comes to most sequels, the filmmakers take the same material from the breakout 2012 release and regurgitate it; however, because its approach has a self-referential pulse beating through every joke and visual gag, the material feels fresh. It's a stale illusion, good for a few hearty laughs, but it ultimately results in an empty experience. By both embracing its cliches and sending them up, Lord and Miller, along with their co-writer Michael Bacall, ""own"" the film's formulaic storytelling through absurdist meta-humor. The conceit of this approach is that, while it attempts to satirize its own laziness by pointing it out for comic effect, the filmmakers aren't interested in coming up with an alternative to the formula. ""All they do is recycle shit from the past and expect us not to notice,"" said Hill's character Schmidt in the original, not that it bothered him or Tatum's character Jenko. In 22 Jump Street, after failing to capture a crime lord named Ghost (Peter Stormare) in the slapstick opening action sequence, Schmidt and Jenko receive a deadpan lambasting from their chief (Nick Offerman), who tells them they're no good as street cops. ""Do what you did before,"" he says. ""That's all anybody wants to see."" When they're assigned another undercover mission, this time at a college instead of a high school, they're told: ""We've doubled the budget, as if that would double the profit."" Tasked by their ever-shouting and scowling boss, Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube), with infiltrating the local MC State campus, our heroes adopt the alter-egos of Brad and Doug McQuaid to sniff out the drug dealer whose product has led to a student's death. But the familiar setup is just an excuse to purvey an overabundance of humor steeped in ironic detachment. They report for duty to the address across the road from ""21 Jump St."" and in the background we see signage for the ""23 Jump St. Condominiums"" under construction; but it's only an ironic promise of a sequelno different than the extended punch-line during the end credits, where we see the franchise's future through ""34 Jump Street"" and beyond. This extended joke is a perfect summation of Lord and Miller's approach, in which every joke that's worth telling is worth beating to death, and then some. Before long, the viewer feels guilty for ever having laughed, because sooner or later, the initial joke is no longer funny. There's another ongoing comedic strain in 22 Jump Street, both in form and function, involving improvisational humor. In"

The problem with highlighting these imperfections is that this follow up to 2012's unexpectedly popular flick falls victim to those very blunders, and attempts to mask lazy plot points and floundering dialogue as clever self-referential wittiness. When the gags aren't being highly repetitious, they're rarely thoroughly competent (regardless of a vigorous start or finish). The ridiculing of pecuniary problems, slam-poetry recitals, and drug-induced hallucinations begins astutely enough, but rapidly turns stale. Alternately, clingy relationship analogies, dating foibles, and weird college roommates commence unsteadily yet gradually find their charm. A stronger focus on crafting fresh jokes over deriding existing cliches might have allowed ""22 Jump Street"" to eclipse its predecessor. Moving into their new headquarters at 22 Jump Street, narcotics agents Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are once again sent undercover, this time to locate the dealer of a dangerous new drug dubbed ""Whyphy."" Assuming the identities of college freshmen, the two enroll in MC State and begin investigating several of the students. While the athletic Jenko quickly bonds with football players Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), Schmidt gets close to refined art major Maya (Amber Stevens). But as the officers' newfound colleagues and lifestyles begin to cloud their sleuthing abilities, the once inseparable duo find themselves at odds, with both their friendship and the case placed in jeopardy. Like the ""Scream"" franchise, ""22 Jump Street"" goes to great lengths to single out the inherent flaws and routine difficulties with a specific genre here, sequels in general (though the action comedy genre is also a target). While budgets increase exponentially, stunts, props, scripts, actors, and, most importantly, laughs are commonly less rewarding. Although the first few self-aware stabs at the repetitive exchanges, the church-based headquarters, and the nearly identical assignment are humorous, the continued jabs at the film's own expense actually detract from the fun. It's as if the filmmakers not only want to make audiences aware of probable sequel-oriented faults to come, but also to reveal those very defects in the movie as it unfolds (though the end credits sequence takes this notion to hysterical new heights). Was the original formula truly worthy of a sequel? ""22 Jump Street"" shouldn't be asking that question of its own viewers. Previous near-death experiences haven't inspired any sincerity or recognition of mortality from the nearly cartoonlike lead characters. Fortunately for them, the new batch of villains (led by the visually perfect Peter Stormare) are equally inept and completely incapable of inflicting real damage even with guns pointed at the heroes while in confined spaces, or while Jenko, with a fresh bullet wound in his shoulder, dangles from a helicopter's landing skids.

The 2012 ""original"" wasn't cutting satire to any extent, but it did at least have a little bit to say about how much high school attitudes have changed, even in 10 years. (The gay kids are the popular kids now, and the jocks are all socially active, eating organic and worrying about the environment.) Whereas the sequel's take on college echoes Homer Simpson's. The ongoing joke is that Schmidt and Jenko are actually in lovethat they're in a real relationship requiring counseling and time away from each other and breakup flings and all of itwhich is a rather moldy conceit in this bro-heavy age. (I feel like three-quarters of the comedies I've watched in the last year are about that exact thing.) Surfacing so soon after Neighbors does 22 Jump Street no favors; that's a movie with a lot more to say about college and growing up, and has the added advantage of featuring a female character who doesn't exist solely to make out with Jonah Hill. This film still has its moments, mostly because it's directed by the duo of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who made the very funny first film and have since exploded with The Lego Movie, which remains the highest-grossing movie of 2014. (You may also recall their late, lamented TV show Clone High.) Still, they're sort of working at half-speed here, offering more of a dashed-off experiment than a fully"

So are 21 Jump Street directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The Lego Movie). But 22 Jump Street is testament that some bands shouldn't get back together. A comic takedown of the cult Fox undercover cop drama of the same name from the 1980s, 2012's 21 Jump Street was a so-so comedy with novelty in its favor. Without that freshness, 22 Jump Street struggles for consistent laughs even more. After going over undercover as high school students to take down a drug dealer, Jenko, the brawny meathead, and Schmidt, the brainy melodramatist, are sent to the generic MC State to stop a new drug called WHYPHY (Wi-Fi) from flooding the campus and beyond. After joining the campus, the pair zero in on two football players named Zook (Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt and Goldie) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro). As part of the investigation, Jenko joins the football team and the players' fraternity. But his bro-bonding with the like-minded Zook causes Schmidt to feel left out, jeopardizing their friendship and the investigation. At least Schmidt can take comfort in hooking up with an attractive coed named Maya (Amber Stevens) who's way out of his league, as her roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell) repeatedly points out in verbal assaults about Schmidt's age. Bell, a former writer for Saturday Night Live and a regular on the Comedy Central series Workaholics, is the best addition to the film. Patton Oswalt has an all-too-brief but humorous cameo as a tenured professor who encourages Jenko to be himself, while Ice Cube, back as the profane and easily aggravated Captain Dickson, steals scenes just as he did in 21 Jump Street. The Zook and Jenko camaraderie over beers, in the weight room, and on the football field has its laughs, as does sad sack Schmidt's jealousy of their friendship. But there's not enough new material for Tatum and Hill. And what there is such as Schmidt improvising a poetry slam piece isn't worth the effort. The actors have a surprising comic chemistry together onscreen, but the script saddles them with the same Mutt-and-Jeff humor that the first Jump Street explored. Breaking free of the familiar is the sequel's biggest struggle. In a brilliant piece of comedy meta, 22 Jump Street acknowledges as much as Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) lectures Jenko and Schmidt before their next undercover assignment at college. He reminds them that their first assignment was a surprise success, which necessitated the need for another operation by the undercover officers. Only this time the budget for their operation is much bigger, as are the expectations. Coming so early in the film, the self-referential speech suggests this comedy won't take such expectations too seriously and apply the same formula of most sequels: a cut-and-paste script, with a new setting and a few news faces, in the hopes that audiences either won't notice or won't care. In TV parlance, this is classic Jump the Shark criteria, and 22 Jump"
104,QIT_Doc5_22_Jump_Street,QIT_Doc5_22_Jump_Street,QIT,Comedy,Negative,22_Jump_Street,"Of the 14 million 1970s and 80s TV shows that were turned into movies, only 21 Jump Street earned a sequel. That's because it had the good sense to take the hyper-emo, After School Special tone of the original and target it like a urinal cake the whole time. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill nailed the mismatch buddy cop vibe, Ice Cube was there to yell at them, and there were just enough laughs to make you forgive the movie when it got boring. Now comes 22 Jump Street, which brings everyone back and tries to squeeze more slightly-above-averageness out of the same incompetent-cops-as-undercover-students premise. It's a shameless rehash, and the characters winkingly acknowledge that upfront. They joke about how lucky it was that the first outing was not a dismal failure, how rehashing the same formula is sure to lead to disappointment and how little business sense it makes to pour more money into the same formula and hope for commensurate success. For a surreal moment or two, 22 Jump Street is onto something as it goes ultra metaroasting itself for having run out of ideas. The only problem is, the doubts the characters jokingly express turn out to be all too valid. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, hot off the success of The Lego Movie, extend that opening bit throughout the whole movie, which turns out to be about how dumb it is to make a sequel to 21 Jump Street. This time, there are enough absurd giggles to make a couple good trailers, but not to make a nearly two-hour movie tolerable. Hill and Tatum are out to infiltrate a college drug ring this time, and the setting is an excuse to push the guys through barely-related skits that hit all the college life touchstones. They move into a dorm, rush a frat and deal with the awkwardness of close-quarters roommates who heard you having sex last night. They also try out for the football team, hit up spring break and check out pretentious improv shows and poetry slams. The stars work best together when the hampering structure fades away and they end up talking about nothing. Hill and Tatum are so naturally funny together, you get the feeling they exchanged the best lines over beers after filming. There's some decent physical stuff, with Tatum or his stunt double pulling off John Woo-style supercop moves, followed by Hill's fat man in a little coat attempts to keep up. But despite the movie's efforts to resurrect the nostalgia of college mayhem, it has enough dead spots to bring back college memories that aren't so good: Waiting in long lines for registration, suffering through interminable lectures and being stuck alone at the dorm while everyone else is out partying and ""forgot"" to invite you. A study in squandered opportunities, 22 Jump Street is most like college in that it's fun at times, but for most of it you're just ready for it to end so you can move"
105,QIT_Doc6_22_Jump_Street,QIT_Doc6_22_Jump_Street,QIT,Comedy,Positive,22_Jump_Street,"22 Jump Street is obvious. 22 Jump Street is a hot mess. 22 Jump Street is 20-30 minutes too long. 22 Jump Street is in many ways a carbon copy of 21 Jump Street. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. 22 Jump Street is also incredibly funny and one of Summer 2014's first true popcorn flicks. In case you're wondering, that's a compliment. If you can surrender yourself to the fact that pretty much everything in 22 Jump Street is intentional, then there's a really good chance that you're going to find yourself a lot like me - sitting in the movie theater recognizing all the film's flaws while also laughing your butt off at its willingness to go pretty much any direction with full-on gusto. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, then it's fairly safe to say you'll find yourself enjoying the reuniting of officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum). Co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who also gave us this year's The LEGO Movie, have created a film that essentially laughs at itself for following the formula that made the low-budget original a success. 22 Jump Street is a bigger, louder, and more expensive film that takes everything you loved about the original film and simply makes it bigger, louder, and more expensive. While lots of films have tried to poke fun at themselves for such an approach, the vast majority have failed. There's something about the strong chemistry between Hill and Tatum and the writing prowess of Lord/Miller that has managed to let this film succeed where so many others have failed. I suppose there is one difference in 22 Jump Street. This time, Schmidt and Jenko are going back to college rather than high school, though a good portion of the film also plays off the fact that both actors clearly look like they're 30-year-olds and everyone on campus seems to know it. While the chemistry between Hill and Tatum helps to carry the film, 22 Jump Street doesn't always work. As noted, the film is a good 20-30 minutes too long and, while I'd stop short of calling the film homophobic, the film's rampant exploitation of the bromance element does start to get a tad uncomfortable the longer it's played out. This may as well be because the angle isn't particularly funny, and when certain lines land with a ""thud"" it feels particularly obvious. To attempt to explain a storyline to you for 22 Jump Street would truly be a futile exercise. The film is a buddy flick that parodies buddy flicks including itself. It's a series of one-liners, witticisms, humiliations, physical comedy, and swagger. Both Hill and Tatum are incredibly winning here, with Tatum getting a terrific chance to flex his muscles while showing that he's a lot more than muscle. Hill, on other hand, gets to geek out and still get the girl. The supporting players, especially Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell, are given quite a bit of room to shine here"

It's a statement repeated so many times, the statement itself has become a cliche. But for every few inferior sequels, there is that one that equals its predecessor or, in super-special cases, surpasses it. So which camp does 22 Jump Street fall into? Comedy sequels are usually especially tainted to be terrible, so Phil Lord & Chris Miller were really going to have to pull something special to make this movie work. But remember: they are Phil Lord & Chris Miller, so why should we be worried? Very much like how 21 Jump Street was aware of itself as a reboot of an 80's property that no one cared about and played with it, 22 Jump Street is aware of itself as a sequel to a highly successful movie with a similar plot and bigger budget and they play with that. The story feels very similar to the first one, but they know it and they both make fun of it and play with your expectations at the same time. It's a comedy goldmine that keeps giving every time you think it runs dry, though all the great non-meta humour also helps support the film and makes sure the film isn't just a bunch of deconstructive, self-referential jabs at Hollywood sequels. Taking away the humour, the story itself isn't quite as good as the first one but the movie works where it really counts, moving at a fast clip and never stooping to crass humour. Oh, and one more hyperbolic note: best end credits sequence from any movie ever. Ever! The main reason 21 Jump Street worked was because of the fantastic chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum and it's just as sharp here, if not more so. Their bromantic relationship is played to the limits (and I mean THE limits), and the two never seem lost for words as they throw jokes back and forth. They're a classic comedy duo for the modern age, and I'd love to see these two do more movies together. Ice Cube returns and is even funnier here in what might be the man's finest performance, even managing to get in on the action this time around. Tatum has a fun subplot with Wyatt Russell as his new BFF, though its resolution feels a bit rushed. Hill's relationship with new love interest Amber Stevens feels similarly cut short, but the jokes mined from that are so funny that it doesn't matter. The villains are a bit weaker here than the first, with Peter Stormare's one joke of being behind the times starts to run thin, but the film quickly wraps up before it starts to get grading. I also wish there was a bit more from cast members of the first film, as Tatum's old nerd friends only have a couple of walk-ons and Brie Larson's character isn't even mentioned; a subject that could have made for a fun self-referential"
107,QIT_Doc8_22_Jump_Street,QIT_Doc8_22_Jump_Street,QIT,Comedy,Positive,22_Jump_Street,"When Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum tumbled onto screens in 2012's 21 Jump Street, a movie reboot of the TV show that launched Johnny Depp's career twenty-five years earlier, expectations had understandably been tempered. The leads were likable enough, but the concept seemed weak and the direction was squarely in the untested hands of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, at that time only known for the wonderfully bonkers Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009). Luckily, the result was smart, warm, and very funny; the double-act of double-acts had nailed it. Could they pull it off again, though, in the brilliantly-monikered sequel 22 Jump Street (2014)? Of course they could. From their meteorologically inclined appetiser through to the universally adored The Lego Movie (2014) just a few months ago, Lord and Miller have excelled at up-ending convention and riffing on genre traits and cliches. Far from being an exception, 22 Jump Street provides more of the same, leaping head first into the very fact that it is the sequel to an unexpected hit and its invariable inferiority to the same. This time, rather than staking out a high school, undercover cops Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are off to college. Called back into the same operation as the first film now located across the street the duo are sent to MC State to uncover the supplier of a new drug called 'WhyPhy'. After the success of the original, a follow-up was inevitable and the writers and directors milk that for every ounce. Opening with a television show's customary ""Previously on..."" recap, Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) then sends them off with a wink to do exactly the same as they did before, but they'll have more money thrown at them this time. The audience is also warned that it's always worse the second time. Fortunately, that's very far from the case with Hill and Tatum on wonderful form again with their charming odd- couple relationship putting the 'romance' in bromance. They're both equally at home as comic actors eve with wince-inducing slapstick most notably put to the test during an opening bust that recalls Beverley Hills Cop (1984). Knowing the genre like the back of their hands the directors balance childish humour with whip- smart asides and a tirade of visual gags, managing to keep all forms of comedy funny throughout. To their immense credit, Lord and Miller even treat their supporting characters played by the likes of Ice Cube and a Mexican Peter Stormare to their share of chuckles. Arguably they save the best for last with an inspired credit sequence that promos the next dozen or so potential (ridiculous) sequels; it's all very meta, or course. Whether or not a third instalment ever arrives on screens, 22 Jump Street is hugely successful in retaining and in many instances, improving upon the qualities of it predecessor and pitching some jokes that will still have people chuckling for days afterwards."
108,QIT_Doc9_22_Jump_Street,QIT_Doc9_22_Jump_Street,QIT,Comedy,Positive,22_Jump_Street,"After its initial action set piece, 22 Jump Street spends a good five-to-ten minutes lampooning its own existence, taking the self-referential humour of the first film's opening act to new levels. ""Things are always worse the second time,"" deadpans Police Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman). Well, he's wrong. In the case of 22 Jump Street, which comes just two years after its surprisingly successful predecessor, pretty much everything is better the second time. We're immediately back in familiar territory, re-joining inept cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as they fluff a job and are placed back under the stewardship of hard-talking police boss Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), who assigns them an undercover task which is suspiciously similar to their last outing only this time they're going to college. Once the guys are back undercover as twin brothers Brad and Doug McQuaid, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who have already had a hit this year with The Lego Movie are free to go about establishing their off-kilter supporting cast, as well as reacquainting us with the Hill/Tatum double act that sparked so deliciously in the first film. Last time out, there was a pleasant subversion of expectations when it turned out that Jenko's jock-like tendencies weren't quite so in-vogue at a modern day high school, and schlubby Schmidt turned out to be the popular guy. This time we swing the other way, as Jenko makes quick friends with the members of the college football team, and Schmidt becomes the loner; that is, until he meets beautiful art student Maya (Amber Stevens). You could argue that, as far as the characters are concerned, it's actually a weaker setup than that of the first film, but the strain placed on Schmidt and Jenko's bromance still works, and garners some great laughs. Lord and Miller allow the film to ramble a little in the mid-section, and the plot drifts in and out of significance, but the remarkable thing is that they pretty much never drop the comedy ball. There are enough funny supporting roles to back up Hill and Tatum in particular Keith and Kenny Yang as the twins next door, and Jillian Bell as Maya's embittered roommate that there are always laughs, even when the duo aren't on screen together. There's also a beefed up role for Ice Cube to sink his teeth into, and he gets some terrific moments, in particular thanks to a plot development half way through. The directors have a great time poking fun at the tropes of the action genre, and the nature of sequels, but none of the self-referential comedy ever feels cynical; the overriding sense you get from the film is one of delirious fun; that there were so many jokes it was an effort just to cram them all in. If the film wasn't funny, that could've got tiresome quickly (particularly as it's almost two hours long), but it hits so many comedy marks that the time simply flies by. Hill and Tatum"

And it totally works. A follow-up to the 2012 hit comedy 21 Jump Street, a big-screen parody of the TV series of the late 1980s, this do-over reunites the duo of Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill), bumbling undercover-cop partners again trying to pass themselves off as students, only this time at a college instead of a high school. The silly shoestring of a plot involves Jenko and Schmidt's task to break up a dangerous drug pipeline called ""WhyPhy,"" which has caused the death of a coed. But that's really just a loosey-goosey framework for a goofy R-rated grab bag of jokes, puns, sight gags and riffs, many of which are truly hilarious, as the two would-be students try to infiltrate campus life. I'm the first person from my family to pretend to go to college,"" says Jenko. Most of the humor revolves around their attempts at blending in, especially since everyone notices immediately how much older they are than everyone else. (""Tell us about the warany one of them,"" prods one student.) But Schmidt impresses his classmates at an improv slam-poetry event (""Jesus died, runaway bride"" is one of his on-the-fly couplets), and Jenko relives his teenage fantasy of becoming a football star, befriending the school's dude-ish quarterback (Wyatt Russell, the son of Goldie Hawn and Curt Russell) and setting up a ""bro-mantic triangle"" subplot. Patton Oswald pops up in one scene as a professor trying to coax coherent thoughts out of Tatum's character's thick head, and the Comedy Central duo of the Lucas Brothers, identical twins Kenny and Keith, make the screen hum with groovy energy every second they're onscreen as laid-back, comically synchronized roommates. Returning as Capt. Dickson, rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube still gets howls with his scowl and plays a pivotal role in one of the movie's funniest scenesa ""gotcha"" that truly sneaks up on you, which is a testament to the craft of returning directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, whose other collaborations include Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and The LEGO Movie. A recurring theme is an in-joke about just how lazy (and pricey) it is to just do the same thing over againin this case, the same characters, same plot, same directors. ""Exactly like last time,"" dryly notes Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman from TV's Parks and Recreation. A chase across the campuswith drug lords in a Hummer pursuing Jenko and Schmidt in a little cart with an enormous football helmet ""cab""destroys everything in its path. At one point, the cart comes to a split: Which way should it go? ""Whichever way's cheaper!"" Jenko shouts. The bawdy comedy tap runs wide open in 22 Jump Street. It may be a ridiculously expensive retread, but man, just about every jolly dollar gets a laugh."
110,RRT_Doc1_Equilibrium,RRT_Doc1_Equilibrium,RRT,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those who survived knew that mankind could never survive a fourth; the volatile nature of human beings would only increase, ensuring continued ruination. So, with classic governmental overreach on the horizon, a new organization is formed: the Grammaton Cleric, whose elite soldiers have only one purpose to eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man, which is his ability to feel. In walks John Preston (Christian Bale), a first-class cleric, tasked with wiping out yet another stronghold of emotion and creativity a stash house of music, art, books, and various trinkets that reflect the remnants of traditional human society. In a rather unintentionally comical moment, Preston stares down the recovered Mona Lisa painting before ordering it to be burned. In this peaceful yet bleak future, any item that might spark feelings is dubbed EC-10 or ""sense offense"" material, which warrants immediate destruction. A drug called Prozium is administered to citizens at regular intervals (mandated by alarm bells sounded off in the city centers and available at Equilibrium buildings), which helps suppress emotions on a personal, chemical basis. But despite all of these precautions, including Vice Counsel Dupont (Angus MacFadyen) routinely interviewing his staff, Preston's partner Errol Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the forbidden, finer things in life such as poetry by Yeats. After discovering Partridge's indiscretions, John executes the man, betraying no emotion at all. Or does he? With each criminal he apprehends, Preston begins to realize that living without feelings negates the very reason to be alive. It may be a complete rip-off of ""1984"" and by extension, ""Brazil,"" ""Gattaca,"" and ""The Matrix"" or any of the other countless, futuristic, oppressive-regime/soul-crushing, postapocalyptic civilization movies, but ""Equilibrium"" is one of the better ones. If a picture is going to borrow heavily from works before it, it might as well loot from the best. It also helps tremendously that writer/director Kurt Wimmer was able to acquire such a talented cast from Bale's efficiency as a dispassionate soldier to the high caliber of notable supporting players like Emily Watson, Sean Bean, and William Fichtner. Even child star Matthew Harbour is exceptional. Great actors, however, can't solely redeem the more mediocre materials in play. There are plenty of overly familiar ideas, such as a Resistance, the ""processing"" of underground fighters, and the involvement of an unseen, supreme leader named ""Father."" To counter this, there are also a few new concepts, such as the gunkata martial arts form (essentially kung-fu with shooting weapons) and the parallels of Preston's downward spiral with that of his partner (along with the well-kept secrets of his wife and children). Unfortunately, rather than exploring the thought-provoking side of fascistic rule, or the tragedies of discovering the righteousness of the opposition and failing to protect loved ones, ""Equilibrium"" goes for the heavy-handed approach. Shooting puppies, striking absurd poses, and abusing slow-motion for the sake of over-the-top action sequences might play up to the target audience,"

But it's true: This medium-budgeted, futuristic action tale that arrives on screens with precious little fanfare is, to my mind, the best film I've seen all year.It's a movie that thrilled and moved and deeply affected me when I got the chance to see it at a very early advance screening last July, and hasn't been out of my mind in the months since. I've been heaping praise on it for so many months to friends, colleagues, family...pretty much anyone who'd listen that it almost feels like I've written this review already. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has delivered an intelligent and honorable riff on such science fiction classics as George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, presenting a not-too-distant future where freedom has been traded for security (a timely subject these days!) through the State-mandated use of emotion-suppressing drugs. War and crime and hate are things of the past in Equilibrium's world, but so are art and creativity and love. This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father, and enforced by a quasi-religious order of ""Clericks,"" whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on ""sense offenders"" who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile. A terrifying future, to be sure, though not one without hope especially when Clerick John Preston (Christian Bale, a much more impressive action hero here than he was fighting dragons in Reign of Fire) accidentally misses his drug dose and begins to feel for the first time. I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of Equilibrium, jammed as it is with surprise and invention suffice to say, this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride, as cerebral as it is visceral; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit. Though the film gets immeasurable mileage out of its cinematography, stunning futuristic production design, and music (an awesome neo-Wagnerian choral score by Klaus Badelt, a frequent collaborator of Hans Zimmer), it's (not surprisingly) the performers who give the proceedings so much gravity. Bale has never been better, combining the sleek coldness that served him so well as Patrick Bateman in American Psychowith a heartbreaking portrayal of a man rediscovering his lost humanity (and paying for the recovery of that humanity: Wimmer cleverly has the violence become more intense and wrenching as Preston learns to feel again). Bale is strongly supported by Emily Watson (one of the most soulful actresses working today, here perfectly cast as a beautiful sense offender who spurs Preston's rebellion against the system), Taye Diggs (having a wicked good time as Preston's suspicious partner), and Angus MacFadyen (sinister and oddly mournful as the head Clerick). This is a cast who seem to be giving their all in the service of a brilliant script, and guided all the way by a"
112,RRT_Doc3_Equilibrium,RRT_Doc3_Equilibrium,RRT,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"Pilfered though it is from many superior (and not-so-superior) sources, Equilibrium has a lot more to offer than you'd expect. Dimension Films (the genre branch of Miramax) sat on it for over a year before finally dumping it into a paltry 301 screens in a December death slot against the big year-end films (i.e., The Two Towers and its like). It didn't even get a chance to make back its relatively low $20 million budget it grossed just over $1 million before disappearing from theaters in three weeks. The movie deserves far better. Equilibrium is not the most original movie to come down the pike it's indebted to your choice of dystopian science fiction (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, The Matrix, Gattaca) but it's a sleek and forceful film of its kind, with some of the most eye-boggling gunfight scenes in recent memory. They're not even gunfights they're more like systematic gun massacres, begun and finished in an eyeblink, with shooter and targets close enough to kiss. John Preston (Christian Bale), a ""Grammaton Cleric"" (i.e., assassin for the government), does far more shooting than kissing. John is one of the black-clad enforcers of the new world order: in the post-WWIII fascist state of Libria, it has been determined that war and violence can be blamed solely on emotion, so all emotions have been outlawed. Scruffy bands of resistance fighters, who have refused to take their daily dose of the emotion-killing drug Prozium, gather together to appreciate art, music, film contraband works of beauty (which are illegal because they inspire feeling). John is a complete moral and emotional blank, which means he's the best at his job, and his two children, raised (like him) on a steady diet of Prozium, are likewise empty. John was married once, but his wife became a ""sense offender,"" rebelling against the emotionless world, and was summarily executed while John stood nearby, not bothered in the slightest. Such a man could never carry a movie if there weren't a change of heart or, in John's case, an introduction of heart in store for him. Christian Bale plays the early scenes almost as a sequel to his dead-zone Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, as if Bateman had finally found his niche as a callous destroyer in the bleak world of Libria and was handed a badge and a gun. But little by little, emotion invades his shell. His partner Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the poetry of Yeats; John neutrally pulls Partridge's plug, but with the tiniest flicker of doubt (""I'll do what I can to see that they go easy on you,"" he says, an odd sentiment for someone supposedly without sentiment). Later, John drops one of his Prozium capsules, but instead of getting a replacement, he begins to have feelings. Some viewers may complain that John, conveniently for the plot, has an emotionally tough day ahead of him the same morning he goes Prozium-free; but he may have had many days just like it"

It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I've seen this film's theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre! Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995-""One Man's Justice""), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998-""Sphere,"" the 1999-""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and the 2003-""The Recruit,"" never got this 'baby' off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state: ""Without love, breath is just a clock ticking""), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of cliches from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It's a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression). Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he's a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called ""Gun-Kata"") going on missions to root out all rebels who haven't taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he's also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge's expected fate is as doomed as Preston's wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner ""I spread my dreams under your feet."" Before you can say 'let's burn some more books' all of the following things happen to Preston: he's given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be"

The moviea mish-mash of Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" George Orwell's ""1984"" and several other 20th Century anti-authoritarian classicsis about a post-nuclear-war world where war and crime have been eradicated, emotion has been banished and all the things that might provoke it, such as great art, poetry, literature and music, have been outlawed as well. Trapped in this world is John Preston (Christian Bale), a ""cleric"" or supercop. His job is to track down art-hoarders and emotion-feelers and destroy their art works, just as it was Guy Montag's job in ""Fahrenheit 451"" to find hidden books and burn them up. Preston is the best there is, thought-policeman numero uno. And, as played by Bale, the fashion-conscious Wall Street maniac of ""American Psycho,"" he has the rapt body moves of a high-tech gun-toting samurai and the lean, high cheekboned, toned and trimmed look of a killer/supermodel. Bale is fairly credible even though he's shown doing preposterous things like burning up the Mona Lisa or shooting his partner Partridge (Sean Bean) through a copy of Yeats' poems. With his dead dark eyes, Bale can make stillness either menacing or poignant. As with most movie heroes of this type, Preston has a soft spot, and you know that sooner or later, he'll turn, just as Montag went over to the book people in ""451."" ""Equilibrium"" has an underground group of art-loving radicals who are deep within the bowels of the city, making bombs. Fairly soon, Preston has found them, fallen in love with captured and condemned dissident, Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and is being pursued himself by his smug, smiling ex-partner Brandt (Taye Diggs) and his snaky little boss DuPont (Angus MacFadyen), who has a few whopping surprises up his sleeve. Preston hardly has a character arc. He starts as a killer and continues as one, simply changing targets. But the movie tries to persuade us that his deeper sensibilities and sensitivity have been awakened by Maryand that, perhaps, the prozium-doped public may be aroused as well. Sure they will. ""Equilibrium"" has a sterile, steely surfaceit was shot mostly in modern-day Berlin in Nazi-era architectureand a trancelike rhythm to go with its derivative, punch-the-keyboard plot. The characters act like robots and the story unfolds like a computer program. It's such a slick, brutal, mechanically constructed film that the intensity of the theme and its anti-technology sentiments keep surprising you. If writer-director Kurt Wimmer loves art and feeling so much, why doesn't he show us more of it? Emily Watson and her yearning, erotic gaze supply most of the movies' softer emotions, while the good guys and bad guys alike keep blasting each other throughout. In ""Equilibrium,"" the rebels are just as destructive as the tyrants, and I'm not sure this is intended with ironyany more than the movie is consciously putting homoerotic undercurrents into"

The plot -- brazenly pillaged from ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"" -- concerns a high-ranking government ""Cleric"" named John Preston (chisel-featured Christian Bale), a ruthless and deadly law enforcer in a ""Metropolis""-styled dystopian future where emotions (and by extension, music, art, poetry, etc.) have been outlawed. The populace takes twice-daily doses of a stupefacient called Prozium, but when passionless Preston misses a couple injections, has a confusing day of emerging feelings, then finds himself staring into the big brown eyes of a cute little puppy he's supposed to kill during a raid on a ""sense offender"" hideout (insert shots of famous paintings being torched with a flame-thrower here), he...just...can't...do it. Instead he hides the puppy in the trunk of his car (a modern sedan discount-retrofitted to look laughably ""futuristic"") and embarks on a mission to single-handedly overthrow the system. I am not making this up. Right from the portentous and pretentious but utterly muddled opening voice-over that quite inadequately sets the stage, this movie is an embarrassment of unintentional laughs. The comic-book-military Nehru jackets, black gloves and slicked hair worn by Preston and his fellow Clerics are funny. The way dramatic shafts of light fall across their cold eyes whenever they say something important is funny. The constant giant-video-screen barrage of ironically impassioned government propaganda is funny, not to mention nonsensical. Funnier still is the scene in which Preston is accused of being off Prozium and when he angrily bellows ""I'm not feeling!,"" his superiors buy it. Most hilarious of all are the many severely over-edited, slow-mo, ""Matrix"" rip-off, shootout-fu action sequences in which Preston kicks Orwellian ass with his tai-chi-based gun slinging, blade swinging and bullet dodging. What isn't so funny is that very talented actors somehow got swept up in this B-movie bottom-scraper. Bale has been known to embrace cheesy movies before (""American Psycho"" arguably, ""Reign of Fire"" certainly), and he's so good at ham-fisted performing that it's impossible to tell if he's taking this movie seriously or if he knows he's hip-deep in crap. This is the second so-bad-it's-funny movie this year for Taye Diggs, playing a rival Cleric who may be forced to bring rebellious John Preston down. Most recently he was superb in ""Brown Sugar,"" but be glad you didn't see the killer sorority bimbo bomb ""New Best Friend."" The real question is, what are the illustrious Emily Watson (""Punch-Drunk Love,""""Gosford Park"") and Agnus McFayden (""Cradle Will Rock,"" ""Titus,"" ""Braveheart"") doing here, playing a condemned ""sense offender"" Preston falls in love with and the autocratic world's maniacal head of state?

116,RRT_Doc7_Equilibrium,RRT_Doc7_Equilibrium,RRT,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"A stunning dystopian piece with fiercely fun combat! Director Kurt Wimmer's science-fiction action-drama Equilibrium (2002) is unfairly lambasted by critics and ignored by movie going audiences. I found myself enjoying revisiting Equilibrium as much, if not more, than when I first saw Equilibrium. I think Equilibrium holds up beautifully. The gun-kata is ridiculous and not as efficient as it pretends to be, like The Matrix' slow motion chaotic combat in a more highly choreographed fashion. However, gun-kata is such an absurdly entertaining, stylish, and slick way to shoot action combat sequences, so who cares if the gun-kata is not realistic? Kurt Wimmer's direction is fabulously sleek and emotionally engaging like he combined the stunning cinematography of Gattaca's sci-fi dystopia with the premise of Fahrenheit 451 and Brave New World or 1984. Equilibrium is quite moving seeing art destroyed and citizens killed just for feeling. Wimmer shows you ordinary people getting gunned down or incinerated to death for convincing depictions of why exterminating emotions with lethal force is just as cruel and violent as humanity's hatred and warfare. Kurt Wimmer's writing is really touching as he understands you must make the viewer care about Preston and humanity with really empathetic and poetic dialogue. His fearsome sci-fi speeches by the autocrat Father are the stuff of 1984 and V for Vendetta dystopian nightmares. I love how Equilibrium focuses on the growing emotional epiphanies that the hero Preston starts to feel. Honestly, Equilibrium is a better adaptation of Fahrenheit 451 than most actual film adaptations of the novel. Writer and director Kurt Wimmer did a wonderful job with Equilibrium. Christian Bale's solemn hero John Preston goes from stoic, book burning, secret police, Grammaton Cleric to devastatingly moving resistor to the political order. Bale knows how to portray a cold, unfeeling killer as well as a deeply felt protagonist, who has changed his entire personality. Bale uses his tearful eyes to show how touched he is by poetic words and lovely music. His use of expressive body language shows when Preston is nervous or tense to calm and reassured. I loved Christian Bale in Equilibrium. Emily Watson is incredible as the fierce and thoughtful as conscientious objector Mary O'Brien. You can feel how gentle and emotional Mary is with Watson's graceful and moving supporting actress performance. Taye Diggs is great as being smug and observant as the treacherously loyal to a fault Brandt. Angus Macfadyen is interesting and commanding as the ultra serious cleric leader Dupont. Sean Bean is only in Equilibrium for a few minutes, but he's unforgettable as the sincerely feeling Errol Partridge. William Fichtner has real gravitas and intelligence as Jurgen. I like that director Kurt Wimmer cameos as a resistance fighter during one raid. Editors Tom Rolf and William Yeh cut sharply throughout Equilibrium with these hard cuts to Christian Bale's face to get his every reaction to the brutal violence before him. They keep the story moving quickly and never lose sight of Equilibrium's purpose in conveying human emotion"
117,RRT_Doc8_Equilibrium,RRT_Doc8_Equilibrium,RRT,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"""Equilibrium"" is like a remake of ""1984"" by someone who's seen ""The Matrix"" 25 times while eating Twinkies and doing methamphetamines. It's set in someone's zany idea of a future totalitarian state where guys in black leather are burning all the poetry but haven't gotten around to picking up the machine guns yet. As Keanu Reeves might say, whoa! Boasting a handsome if over-digitized production and a bevy of male beauties as central characters (there's a big cheekbone thing going on here), the movie has evolved at least one degree from the dystopian broodings of Orwell. That is, its central conceit is based on antidepressants that weren't around in Orwell's day. In this future, it is law that every day in every way, every citizen must take an injection of the drug Prozium, which reduces humankind to an efficient if narcoticized half-life. In exchange for this miasma of stupor, the folks do enjoy freedom from crime, aggression, jealousy and all those other messy attributes of what is called the Human Condition. But writer-director Kurt Wimmer takes this intriguing idea a little too far and ventures off into Cloud Cuckooland: Since art stirs feelings, art (including poetry, drama and mein gott! movie criticism) is banned. Thus the reigning stud-pups of this future are an elite security cult, called Clerics. In obedience to ""Father"" (the movie's dim-bulb simulation of Orwell's horrifying Big Brother) they raid underground crypts and out-of-the-way apartments where heavily armed dissenters still bliss out on the Mona Lisa and Andy Warhol's soup cans and the poetry of noted revolutionary Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The plot proper turns on the adventures of Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale, cheekbone rating 9.8), who is a kind of mythically effective killing machine charged with blowing away Gerard Manley Hopkins readers with AK-47s. He's so efficient that he turned in his own wife for elimination, having detected certain deviant fondnesses for, I don't know, Hermann Hesse or something. But one night, after an especially hectic day of rat-tat-tatting perverts and art mavens, he forgets to take his Prozium and those horrible messy tidal waves called emotions guilt, love, pain, regret, sentimentality come over him. He regrets frying his wife, and his former partner (Sean Bean, cheekbone rating 9.1) and, like the great Winston Smith before him, begins to develop his own set of deviant impulses. At the same time, his ambitious new partner (Taye Diggs, cheekbone rating 9.3). is beginning to suspect him. Then, in Plot Twist 18, he's falling in love with revolutionary poetess Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson, cheekbone rating 4.2) and, eventually (Plot Twist 37), consorting with a revolutionary leader (William Fichtner, cheekbone rating 765.9). Busy, busy, busy. To make it busier, Wimmer has conceived the clerics as having Zen-like close combat skills; they can dodge bullets by undulating in slow motion, they can unleash stylized karate mayhem like Hong Kong stuntmen, they can shoot with scientific precision anything that holds bullets. This leads to far too many ridiculous dancelike gunfight/kung-fu sequences in"

It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun. The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment. In a free society many, maybe most, audience members will hardly notice the message. But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous. You know who you are. The movie is set in the 21st century--hey! that's our century!--at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His. Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend. Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feels--well, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id. If ""Equilibrium"" has a plot borrowed from 1984, Brave New World and other dystopian novels, it has gunfights and martial arts borrowed from the latest advances in special effects. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that"

He/it has determined that man's inhumanity to man is fueled by his ability to feel. Hence everybody's on heavy doses of Prozium, which makes them think and behave in a neutral, obedient fashion. Subsidiary clericks like top-of-class John Preston (Christian Bale) are trained to intuit signs of sense offenses, thereby ferreting out persons who read books, look at paintings, listen to music, hide pre-Grammaton memorabilia, go off medication, or otherwise dare forbidden emotions. Offenders are invariably executed; one such was Preston's own wife, some years ago. The occasional nostril twitch suggests he perhaps wasn't as hunky-dory with that event as he claims, though grade-school-aged son Robbie (Matthew Harbour) appears to be developing just fine into a droning little fascist-snitch. It's unclear just how much of civilization is left, or even if there are other cities outside pic's Librya. There are pockets of illegal dissent beyond town limits, however, in a zone known as the Nethers. John & Co. are frequently dispatched there to break up radical cells and torch their verboten booty. In a sequence that sets the somber-silly tone, ""Equilibrium's"" first such raid uncovers wouldn't ya know it the original Mona Lisa! To which blowtorch is immediately applied. When his clerick-ing workmate commits suicide rather than be exposed as a Yeats-reading sense offender, John gets a new partner. Brandt (Taye Diggs) is a by-the-book squealer who immediately suspects Preston of harboring illicit ideas. Indeed, protag has stopped taking his Prozium, and is fishing about trying to join the resistance. Still keeping up the good front, he regretfully takes part in the bust of free-thinker Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson, utterly wasted in just a few scenes), who sees him for the sensitive soul he's secretly becoming. In this supposedly far-advanced society, plot holes are widened by the apparent nonexistence of bullet-proof vests or phone call tracing. Among numerous absurdities is Mary marching like Joan of Arc (or a volcano-sacrificed jungle virgin) to her sentenced doom, an event prompting Preston to declare, ""She's scheduled for combustion!"" Or a final digitized robo-t'ai chi-fu face-off between hero and chief nemesis (Angus MacFayden) that looks a whole lot like patty-cake. Much of the ultimately-inspirational nonsense is drenched in the ominous, then heavenly choirs of Klaus Bedelt's score, which doesn't get the joke, either. Reminiscent of ""Gattaca"" some years back, ""Equilibrium"" gets away acceptably with doing ""the future"" on a medium budget by focusing on utilitarian, bureaucratic and/or desolate landscapes, with gray the primary color. F/x and animation aspects are OK, though fight trickery that worked for ""Matrix"" and certain imitators doesn't work here.

This endlessly fascinating swirl of a film could have come only from Nolan, who blends the cerebral twistiness of Memento (his thriller that moves backward in time) with the spectacular action of his Batman megahit, The Dark Knight. DiCaprio, as a thief-for-hire named Cobb, doesn't merely skulk around sleeping minds, pilfering strangers' secret thoughts. He and his team, complete with architect, actually construct the dream worlds they'll enter, with streets that can rise up and become wallsthe city as Murphy bedor, if things go wrong, a train roaring through city traffic. You may get a headache keeping up with the plot as Cobb tries to plant a new idea in a man's brain; stealing thoughts is simple, but adding one is a risky operation involving a dream within a dream within a dream. Even as you tick off the film's overload of references, thougha Matrix here, a James Bond therethe amazing effects and Cobb's quest carry you along. But Nolan is the brainiest of Hollywood directors, and Inception is more than the ultimate ""it was all a dream"" movie. It is the most sophisticated in a year of splashy screen events about parallel worlds, in which characters enter alternate realities and return with some solution to personal and often global problems. Cobb's dangerous assignment is meant to save the world from an energy conglomerate. Avatar's hero goes to Pandora, falls for its nature-loving people, and learns to value the environment. The characters on Lost travel sideways to other times and places in what seems an attempt to escape the island, but turns out to be a way to save their own souls. Even Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland transforms Lewis Carroll's story into a journey of self-discovery fit for the 21st century. The movie's Alice is a 19-year-old who returns from Wonderland realizing she doesn't have to marry the smug gentleman her family selected; she can head out to sea and open a trade route to China instead. These films, not radical-minded indies but among the most expensive and popular onscreen, suggest that reality is so fraught and problematic that we need to go elsewhereout of this world or deep into our mindsto see things clearly. They evoke a Wizard of Oz parallel dimension (""You're not in Kansas anymore, you're on Pandora,"" the villainous colonel in Avatar warns), but their lessons are more political than ""There's no place like home."" Cobb is hired by a businessman (Ken Watanabe) to plant a thought in the brain of a rival (Cillian Murphy). The new idea: the rival must break up the conglomerate he is about to inherit, which is poised to control half the world's energy and become, as one character puts it, ""a new superpower.""

That's the gist of many of the rave reviews currently circulating in the American press in the wake of his new, brain-teasing sci-fi thriller. Nolan gained critical success early on with Memento, then hit the other kind of jackpot with the Batman franchise. Now, with Inception, which he wrote as well as directed, he seems to have the whole world at his feet. Which is apt, because the central characters in Inception dabble in ""pure creation"" and, as a result, feel ""like gods"". To start at the beginning which, naturally, is a false start the film is set in a cut-throat future. Separated from his kids thanks to a crime he (possibly) didn't commit, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is employed by a corporation to steal ideas from people while they're sleeping. His latest victim, Saito (Ken Watanabe), turns the tables and demands that Cobb plant an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), who is heir to a business empire that is on the brink of world domination. If Cobb can convince Fischer to break up this empire, Saito will pull strings so that Cobb's ""crime"" is overlooked. Cobb assembles a crack team, including unflappable boffin Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), mischievous forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and earnest undergraduate Ariadne (Ellen Page). She is to be the team's ""architect"", creating a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream that Fisher will at all times accept as ""real"". There are two problems. Fischer has been trained to resist brain infiltration. And Cobb's own demons are running amok in the subconscious realm a runaway train and a noirish dame (Marion Cotillard) seem to have it in for our man. Cobb insists he has things under control but, as Arthur deadpans, ""I'd hate to see you out of control."" Inception is the kind of information-packed movie that creates the painful/pleasurable sensation that there's no time to think. There's a whole new vocabulary to be mastered (""projections"", ""kicks"" and ""totems""). Your ears are bombarded, and not just by Hans Zimmer's indignantly doom-laden score, but by in-jokes, such as the playing of Edith Piaf's Je Ne Regrette Rien, which was sung by Cotillard in La Vie en Rose. Your eyes, if they are to catch clues like the design of a certain passport stamp, would be advised not to blink. The ideas that Nolan is toying with are deliciously meta-textual. Key characters are suffering from what literary critics like to call The Anxiety of Influence, the fear that they are someone else's creation and that original thought is impossible. Which begs the question, how original is Inception itself? Nolan's narrative borrows from such other navel-gazing gems as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Cronenberg's eXistenZ, Soderbergh's Solaris and Richard Linklater's Waking Life. It flat-out plunders The Matrix, the guilt-laden Don't Look Now and everything Philip K Dick has ever written. It's got a wee bit of Citizen Kane in there, too.

Heaven knows what artist Laurie Anderson would make of Christopher Nolan's first film since ""The Dark Knight,"" but if audiences don't go for it, we're more likely to hear a different complaint: It's just too darned complex. A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolan's own original screenplay, ""Inception"" is the smartest CGI head-trip since ""The Matrix."" The premise is so out-there, it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain, so do yourself a favor and pay attention. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb, an ""excavator,"" who digs around in people's subconscious while they're catching some zzzzs. This act of infiltration is ""not strictly legal""; the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft. It's also not a solo operation. To do the job properly requires an ""architect,"" basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape, something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamer's defenses down. Depending on the complexity of the project, it might also require a ""burglar,"" a ""chemist"" and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well-timed wake up call. Cobb's partners include Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a newbie, Ariadne (Ellen Page); Yusuf (Dileep Rao); and Eames (Tom Hardy). Their client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants more than access to a rival industrialist's grey matter; he requires Cobb to plant an idea in there that will dismantle an entire conglomerate. As if that weren't hard enough, Cobb is also plagued with keeping his own demons at bay, in the form of an angry dead wife (Marion Cotillard). DiCaprio evidently hasn't got ""Shutter Island"" out of his system yet. A kind of meta-heist movie, ""Inception"" evokes Philip K. Dick's cerebral sci-fi, the exploration of alternate states of consciousness, memory and fantasy. But these are also Nolan's themes, familiar from the amnesiac noir of ""Memento"" and the many, varied mind-games practiced by the warring magicians in ""The Prestige"" as well as the psychological warfare between Batman and his adversaries (fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here). ""An idea is like a virus,"" says Cobb, and that idea too might have been born in Gotham City or in the rabid enthusiasm that greeted ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige,"" ""Inception"" is constructed as a box of tricks. Ariadne (who helped Theseus slay the minotaur in Greek mythology) devises labyrinths that are also escape hatches, and that metaphor of the maze runs through ""Inception,"" which is itself a puzzle to be navigated by filmmaker and audience alike. In the course of probing his subject's subconscious, Cobb escorts him into a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream.

Probably not, but writer-director Christopher Nolan takes a stab at breaking down the structure of a dream and the influence of the subconscious in Inception. There's nothing more perplexing than the unknown and Nolan uses that to his advantage. It's one thing to simply make up a story about a theoretical concept, but it's another to come up with a scenario and actually make it feel real and that's exactly what he achieves in Inception. It may be Nolan's dream world, but it's so exciting, so disturbing and seems so authentic, you might start to wonder. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an extractor. He's employed to sneak into people's dreams and steal their secrets. Turns out the gig comes with some serious baggage and Cobb wants out, but the only way he can safely return home is by completing one last job for a businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe). The problem is, Saito doesn't want Cobb to snatch someone's secret information, he wants him to do the unthinkable, plant an idea in a subject's mind inception. The general premise, while intriguing, can sound pretty absurd, but Nolan approaches the story in such a well thought out and artistic manner, it practically feels real. Even when the information is sparse, Nolan grabs hold and doesn't let go through sheer stellar action and cinematography. In the film's opening scene, little is known about Cobb's line of work, however, you're eager to join his cause making the reality of the situation a little easier to digest when Cobb comes to. And that's when the real fun begins. Once the stage is set, Cobb begins to assemble his team for the inception gig. He's already got his right hand man, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but now must find himself an architect. That's where Ellen Page comes in. She plays Ariadne, a budding designer who's swooped up by Cobb and hurled into his dream worlds. Cobb also enlists the help of a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), a chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and even agrees to take his employer, Saito, along for the ride. Together they'll infiltrate the mind of an heir to a major corporation, Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy), and plant an idea so deep inside, he'll think it was his all along. Inception clocks in at a whopping 148 minutes, but not once will you feel compelled to check your watch. The drizzle of data during the opening sequence quickly becomes a shower once Cobb amasses his crew and from then on, even blinking can run you the risk of missing a vital piece of information. You're not a member of the audience, you're a member of Cobb's team and should you misstep, it could thwart the whole operation.

Director/writer Christopher Nolan conceived the premise for the film 10 years ago when he was first fascinated with blending waking life with dreams and the ability to corrupt dreams. His resulting screenplay has a complex, hard-to-follow, story-within-a-story, dream-on-top-of-dream plotline that might test the patience of the casual viewer. But stick with it; all the head-scratching antics lead to an intellectually stimulating and emotionally fulfilling finale. Nolan's eclectic, fine-tuned blend of action and art was firmly established with his signature Batman film, ""The Dark Knight;"" arguably the best action film made in the last two decades. Scenes of Cobb running from assailants in the streets of Mumbai are every bit as exciting as those in ""The Bourne Identity."" A sequence in a hotel hallway that is set on an angle with Arthur and an attacker fighting in zero gravity is stunning. Visuals of buildings and neighborhoods reflecting each other, and then landing on top of each other are spectacular. Nolan's extraordinary direction is aided perfectly by cinematographer Wally Pfister, editor Lee Smith, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers who were all part of ""The Dark Knight"" technical team. Using an angst-worn protagonist to give the sci-fi laden, techno-heavy story a personal feel was smart. It was even smarter to cast the ever-passionate DiCaprio in the pivotal lead role. Although, a sharp agent might encourage him to skip the overpowering real-or-not-real themed film genre (""Shutter Island"" opened just months ago) and take a roll in a simple drama where viewers could focus primarily on his acting (e.g. ""Basketball Diaries""). Wantanabe, Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard and Page give solid supporting performances, but DiCaprio's emoting drives this movie, albeit under a cloud of visual theatrics. Countless, empty-headed blockbusters have paraded across movie screens this summer. It's refreshing to experience an always-tense, extremely suspenseful sci-fi action film that respects a viewer's intelligence."

The film is bookended and periodically interrupted by real Dust Bowl veterans' talking heads, their hard times testimonies taken from a Ken Burns doc on the topic. It speaks to Christopher Nolan's admirably idiosyncratic instincts that he'd ground visualizations of near-mystical journeys through quantum physics with seemingly incompatible Burns talking heads; it speaks simultaneously to his imaginative limitations that he can think of no better way to contextualize his work. I take Nolan semi-seriously, at least enough to wish he was better; he's got some moves, two pretty faultlessly entertaining films in The Prestige and The Dark Knight, and certainly an idiosyncratic enough agenda. As Mike D'Angelo has succinctly outlined, Christopher Nolan's major, none-too-subtle recurring concern is demonstrating that we live in a universe whose workings can be explained in rational terms: he makes blockbusters for militant atheists. Interstellar adds a hefty amount of quantum physics to the mix, first as exposition, then visualized. Granted basically unlimited resources from the studio coffers, Nolan thinks it's essential that he deliver talking heads first explaining in 70mm how a wormhole works before the obligatory big f/x showpieces, an allocation of resources I find both charming and frustratingly symptomatic. I may not read a more bemusingly maddening sentence from a director this year than Nolan's explanation of why The Thin Red Line is one of his Criterion Collection top 10 picks: ""What better than Malick's extraordinary vision of war to demonstrate the technical potential of a carefully mastered Blu-ray?"" It's clear Nolan as viewer has patience for the ineffable hard to imagine a Thin Red Line or 2001 admirer who didn't possess a capacity to admire that which can't be fully articulated but what a comical comedown in the second half of that sentence, such a rational explanation for his pick just in case you doubted his preference. Part of the reason you can trust Nolan with final cut is because he's similarly always guaranteed to not go well and truly off the reservation and pull a Southland Tales. An admiring New York Times profile had Nolan explaining how he thinks about how much hand-holding the audience needs vis-a-vis his development of The Dark Knight: ""Execs are very good at saying things like, 'What's the bad guy's plan?' They know those engines have to be very powerful. I had to say: 'The Joker represents chaos, anarchy. He has no logical objective in mind.' I had to explain it to them, and that's when I realized I had to explain it to the audience."" There's an analogy in the P.G.

I know it's a head scratcher in general, but after I saw it there was one thing I wanted to understand more than anything else: How did Christopher Nolan come up with the name ""Dom Cobb""? Was it because ""Dom Cobb"" sounds like something you say when you're just waking up but you're not really awake yet? And you're making that jaw motion where you open and close your mouth like a fish trying to talk while you mumble some incoherent ""om, om"" syllable because your lips are sticking together? And the person next to you goes, ""What was that, honey? Dom Cobb?"" Maybe Dom Cobb is a metaphorical name like Ariadne or Mal, other characters in this turgid crowd pleaser, and I just didn't know what the significance was. A lot of people who have seen it will tell you that Inception is one big metaphora movie about making movies, about how movies work, about what it's like to see movies, and how close they are to dreams and how life is a like a dream and like a movie, too. ""It's a movie about movies!"" these fans insist, giving special emphasis to the word movies the way sometimes people used to say something meaningful was about life. Then they tell you how it was about movies. What they don't tell you is that it's about bad movies. ""Always imagine new places,"" Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) instructs, but Inception refuses to do that. It presents instantly recognizable non-places, swanky hotel bars in world capitals, vistas from James Bond movies with skiing in them, post-apocalyptic landscapes from comic books. Suffused with an ahistorical sensibility, this insta-remake of Shutter Island combines the washy metaphysics of Nicholas Roeg films with Where Eagles Darea range of unsmiling British unfun. Terrible dialogue fights to the death with bombastic music meant to pound a ""militarized subconscious"" into further submission, which it does. Inception succeeds in convincing us for two and a half hours that somehow our dreams and lives are exactly like all the bad action movies we have ever seen. The film has none of the vivid unpredictable banality of dreams or life. Instead it has the kind of banality found in Speed 2it puts dreamers on cruise control, lays them out on gurneys, runs them up and down elevators. I can't recount the plot of Inception or tell you what it means, but I can tell you this: People whose dream movie is a bad movie about dreams that are like bad movies are fucked."

It is a grandiose conceptual thriller in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a brilliant ""extractor"", one who enters another's dreams and filches their secrets. Apparently his success rate has made him notorious in the corporate espionage racket, but now there's a new wrinkle. His latest client (Ken Watanabe) wants him not to steal an idea, but to insert one in the mind of a business rival (Cillian Murphy). For the first 15-20 minutes I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Dreams-within-dreams, projections, figments and mazes are part of the fancy talk batted around by DiCaprio and his cool young team of specialists, who include Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dileep Rao. As the fog thins, we find that Nolan is dispersing his narrative over a number of levels, flip-flopping between a car chase through rain-lashed streets, a gunfight atop an Alpine redoubt, another in ""unreconstructed dream space"" wherever that is. So we're essentially watching a sychronized cycle of dream sequences, with occasional intrusions from the ghost of DiCaprio's wife (Marion Cotillard), who still has some unspecified grievance with her husband. This is a lot to digest, even at two-and-a-half hours' length. It is intricate, it is convoluted, it is mysterious. It is also lavishly boring. Advance word on the movie promised mind-blowing visual effects, and there are indeed some arresting images along the way. Admire, if you will, a city folding over on itself like a gigantic sandwich, or the funhouse spectacle of Gordon-Levitt fighting a bad guy in a zero-gravity hotel corridor. But the point of them? Are we really admiring inventiveness here, or just those tricks that designers can conjure in a lab? It is said that Inception is a long-cherished project of Nolan's, though its metaphysical hoop-jumping has nothing new on the first Matrix, or Minority Report, or even his own great Memento, which is about 10 times more exciting and made for a fraction of the present film's $200m. The real cause of wonder, though, is why Nolan should have embraced technocratic complexity in the service of such a puny story namely, how to dupe the unloved son of a tycoon into breaking up his business empire. What possible insight does that afford us into our dreams, or our fears, or that level of consciousness we know as ""life""? And this is a film I've already heard being hailed as a masterpiece. Hmm.

I suppose how you feel about Inception depends on whether you compare it to Nolan's Batman movies, which I have not seen, or his brilliant breakout film, Memento, which I have seen more than once. Perhaps both of these comparisons are misguided and Inception should be evaluated in the company of other big budget, head-trippy futuristic fare, with or without sci-fi trappings; Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, Total Recall, Brazil, and no doubt lots of other stuff I've never seen. Be this as it may, I am inclined to compare Inception to Memento because the former so plainly presents itself as a thinking man's action thriller, with a complex psychological premise we are expected to find as engaging as the one around which Nolan constructed Memento. It would be easy merely to dismiss Inception's failure on this score as being the result of it saddling its complex psychological premise with way too much action thriller baggage. Clearly, the intense drama achieved by the low-budget, street life, daylight Noir of Memento is not even approximated by the capital-intensive, fantasy land, CGI overload of Inception. But the real problem with Inception has to do with its complex psychological premise in the first place. In the first place, it's truly not complex at all. Set aside all the mumbo-jumbo tech talk about how there are concentric rings of the unconscious that can be induced, invaded and controlled by others from without. What remains is the most banal, coffee-table Freudian stuff. So much smoke and mirrors about how to manipulate the inner workings of the mind through the power of suggestion, only to trot out and ride the tried and true hobbyhorse of a father figure fixation. Jesus, why not simply put the billionaire victim in intensive (and expensive) psychotherapy, let him take forever to get over daddy, and take over his inherited company while he's preoccupied on the couch. In the second place, the psychological premise is way too complex. On this score, the demands of the action thriller really are at fault. In order to establish the changing situations that facilitate the variety of thrilling action, the Byzantine architecture of the head-trippy plot takes on ever more inconsistent proportions that must be justified by ad hoc explanations in the dialogue. The constitutional articles of the psychological premise are continually undergoing congressional amendment. Just when being murdered in a dream is the mechanism for waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different mechanism is introduced. Just when there is definitely a mechanism of some sort - any sort - to ensure waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different and deeper ring of the unconscious is introduced, from which it may be impossible escape.

But why? To what end? His new movie, ""Inception,"" is an astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly. Nolan has devoted his extraordinary talents not to some weighty, epic theme or terrific comic idea but to a science-fiction thriller that exploits dreams as a vehicle for doubling and redoubling action sequences. He has been contemplating the movie for ten years, and as movie technology changed he must have realized that he could do more and more complex things. He wound up overcooking the idea. Nolan gives us dreams within dreams (people dream that they're dreaming); he also stages action within different levels of dreamingdeep, deeper, and deepest, with matching physical movements played out at each levelall of it cut together with trombone-heavy music by Hans Zimmer, which pounds us into near-deafness, if not quite submission. Now and then, you may discover that the effort to keep up with the multilevel tumult kills your pleasure in the movie. ""Inception"" is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else. The outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper. Leonardo DiCaprio, with a full head of golden hair and a touch of goatee, plays Cobb, an international thief. Not a common thief, but an ""extractor"": he puts himself to sleep, enters the dreams of another person, then rummages around and steals something important that pops out of the sleeper's unconsciousan industrial secret, say. Saito (Ken Watanabe), the head of an enormous Japanese energy company, hires Cobb to go beyond extraction to inception; that is, not to steal an idea but to plant one that the dreamer will think is his own. Just like Danny Ocean preparing to crack a safe, Cobb assembles a larcenous crew, who will enter the mark's dreams with him. There's a dream architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), who can create convincing interior worlds, so that the dreamer will think that everything is real. There's a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), who, in the dreams, can embody any person known to the dreamer. There's a chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), to drop both the team and the target into deeper layers of sleep with a super-sedative. And there's a kind of dream manager, a demanding, unimaginative sourpuss named Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to insure that the fantastic sting comes off. There's also a wild card. Cobb's dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), keeps jumping out of the lower reaches of his mind bearing a knife or a gun and crashing into the created dreams. Cobb is still in love with her, and feels guilty about something he did to her. Occasionally, he takes a rusty old elevator down to his subconscious and visits her.

But while returning director Andy Muschietti manages to craft a couple of creepy moments, the overall effect is one of overkill. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) was pretty scary when we saw his demonic eyes peeping out of storm drain but the tension plummets every time he pops up in this crushingly repetitive sequel. The first film was about a gang of troubled teenagers from the 1980s who teamed up to battle a shape-shifting, child-stealing clown. Now 27 years later, they return to their home town of Derry to face him again as equally messed-up adults. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa),the only member of ""The Losers' Club"" who has remained in Derry is also the only one who can remember their promise to return home if the clown ever resurfaced. When he pops up again, Mike calls Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan) and Stanley (Andy Bean), who, rather improbably, are all big shots in the city. To defeat him they must return to a childhood haunt, confront an old trauma and retrieve an artefact to use in a killer clown-banishing ritual devised by the local native American tribe. Hader's Richie, who is now a famous stand-up, gets the funniest lines but McAvoy's Bill steals most of the running time. He's a famous horror writer (and King surrogate) whose novels are being turned into movies. A running, and very risky, in-joke is that his friends think his stories suffer from rubbish endings. Each mission forces a loser to tangle with the clown. Every character has a scary encounter where they retrieve the artefact and most of them also get an extended flashback to an terror from their childhood. The scenes in the 1980s (where they are played by the child actors from the original) are pointless. They do nothing to advance the plot and, as we know they survive to adulthood, have no sense of peril. The grown-up ones are a mixed bag. Jessica Chastain's encounter with a seemingly harmless old woman is wonderfully staged but McAvoy's time in a fairground hall of mirrors must have felt hackneyed when King wrote the novel. As these set-pieces could be put in any order, the film feels more like a series of randomly assembled shorts than a coherent feature film. And don't expect to see them brought together in a devastating clever finale. It turns out that gag about Bill's novels is horribly misjudged."

They reunite decades later after tragedy strikes. I'm referring, of course, to Chhichhore, the Indian dramedy that carries such striking parallels to It Chapter Two, based on the Stephen King novel. If you pointed a gun at me and forced me to watch one of those films again, I'd think that was a weird and messed-up thing for you to do, but I'd also pick the Indian film, because this box-office champion has all its predecessor's flaws and screws up almost everything the original had right. Picking up 27 years after the events of the first film, a grown-up Mike Hanlen (Isaiah Mustafa) sees a cluster of murders in the town of Derry, Maine and decides that Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) has somehow returned to prey on the townsfolk. The other members of The Losers all left town as adults, with Bill (James McAvoy) enjoying great success as a Stephen King-like famous horror novelist and Richie (Bill Hader) as a standup comic, but they took an oath to return if the clown ever came back. Their resolve to kill him permanently is strengthened by Beverly (Jessica Chastain), who has foreseen short lives and nasty deaths in all their futures if they don't. When I review Joker, I'll tell you why scary clown movies don't do much for me, but both this and the original seem to have the wrong end of the stick. In the first film, we saw young Beverly (Sophia Lillis) as a 14-year-old girl who went home from school every afternoon and wondered whether her father was going to rape her. I mean, that's real terror. Yet somehow It found that shape-shifting demon clown more interesting. This movie has Pennywise as the embodiment of these adults' fears left over from their childhood traumas, and that's fine, but that's dealt with in the lamest possible way. When Beverly goes back to her childhood apartment, she's chased by a giant hideous old woman with sharp teeth. Surely her father reappearing to her would have been more fearsome to her and us. The Losers' loved ones and professional obligations drop away once everyone's in Derry, as no one bothers to check up on them, even though Bill is married to the lead actress (Jess Weixler) of a film adaptation of his work that's in the middle of shooting and anxiously awaiting his rewrites. All the flashbacks involving the kid versions of these characters could have been lost, and I like Lillis and Jack Dylan Grazer are strong presences. Stray subplots are everywhere: The opening scene shows us the murder of a gay man (Xavier Dolan) by some Derry homophobes, and then we never hear anything about it or its connection to Pennywise again. The same goes for Bev's marriage to a pathologically jealous husband who beats her with a belt. Pennywise eats"

Stephen King horror adaptation returns with It: Chapter Two. Delivering great characters and plenty of scares, the film hopes to also deliver some much-needed box office juice for the studio amid an otherwise difficult year. The first It opened to $123 million domestic, on its way to $327 million in North American receipts and a global total of $700 million, making it the biggest R-rated horror release in cinema history, as well as the third-highest opening for an R-rated film (behind both Deadpool movies) and the fourth-highest grossing R-rated movie of any genre (behind the two Deadpool films and The Matrix: Reloaded). It: Chapter Two is currently tracking toward about $100 million stateside, but tracking is an iffy proposition and we've seen plenty of films either blow past expectations or fall far short. Tracking is just a snapshot of the effectiveness of a film's marketing at a given point in time, and it often underestimates turnout among demographics overindexing on social media. Some of the expected falloff of opening numbers for the sequel is based entirely on assumptions that the longer runtime will equate to less screenings per day and less audience interest, neither of which is necessarily true, as Avengers: Endgame made glaringly apparent earlier this year. With no significant challengers opening against it and no recent holdovers looking to score significant numbers this weekend, It: Chapter Two has the field to itself. Additionally, Fandango reports It: Chapter Two is their best-selling horror title of all time, and is the #1 film choice for the September-to-November period according to Fandango's audience polling. Recall that the first It film was tracking at $60+ million before opening week estimates eventually rose to $85 million, and then expectations jumped again to $100+ million based on opening day numbers. The final $123 million debut cume wound up far ahead of those numbers, obviously. So I think anticipation for the sequel and positive audience word of mouth will combine to lift it past tracking estimates toward $110 million range. Yes, Chapter Two so far has a lower Rotten Tomatoes score than the first film, but it's still squarely in ""fresh"" territory and audiences don't generally seem to care much about critical reactions to big highly anticipated films anyway, especially in the horror genre. The international numbers will likely come in higher than last time, north of $100 million I suspect (and most tracking estimates support that prediction). So my expectation is a worldwide opening of $200-210+ million. 2017's It had a final multiplier of 2.65x off its $123 million bow. If the sequel manages a lower but still healthy 2.3x multiplier, that's good enough for $250+ million if it opens to $110 million. It could of course wind up with a final multiplier closer to 2.5x, which still assuming a $110 million debut would translate to"

As I explained in Slate back in 2017 on the occasion of the release of It: Chapter One, It holds a particularly cherished position in my heartI've reread Stephen King's magnum opus so many times since I first read it in middle school that I've literally lost countso there was never any question that such absences were going to stand out to me. But watching It: Chapter Two, a visually inventive and at times extremely scary film that, at nearly three hours long, could have stood to omit considerably more, I couldn't help but feel like many of director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman's choices in adaptation were much worse than necessary sacrifices. They felt like grave misunderstandings, if not willful betrayals, of some of the richest parts of their source material. Like most 1,000-page, decades-spanning novels about clowns who kill children, It has long been thought to be an unfilmable work. It: Chapter One acquitted itself surprisingly well in this regard, although it did so by sailing the ol' paper boat down the road, so to speak. In adapting King's novel to the screen, Muschietti and Dauberman made two major changes to the original material. The first was disentangling the novel's two parallel timelinesone about the protagonists' childhood and the other about their adulthoodto make them two discrete entities presented in chronological order. (In King's novel these two sections are interwoven with one another.) The second was changing the eras in which these two sections are set. In the novel, the childhood sections take place in 1957 and '58, and the adulthood sections in 1984 and '85; in the movie, the childhood section takes place in 1988 and '89, and the adulthood section in 2016. It: Chapter One thus offered audiences the surprisingly enjoyable experience of watching an R-rated horror film starring a remarkably charismatic cast of foulmouthed adolescents, while collaterally benefiting from the rush on 1980s nostalgia prompted by the runaway success of Netflix's Stranger Things, a show that owed no small debt to King's body of work. In choosing this more linear structure, though, the filmmakers also opted to backload many of the novel's most complex and compelling aspects onto the second movie, setting themselves up for a landing more difficult to execute than the Ritual of Chud. That It: Chapter Two struggles to completely stick that landing is no fatal failure, and in many ways confirms what those of us who love this novel have suspected all along: that It is, indeed, an unfilmable book. But what is particularly discouraging is the manner in which Chapter Two misses its marks, as the filmmakers' choices too often seem to come at the expense of the moral world of the source material.

When members of the Losers' Club honour the pledge they made as kids, returning to Derry in the wake of a horrendous hate crime, they experience a group hallucination in a Chinese restaurant at roughly the same time as the fortune cookies arrive. Slithering eyeballs, human-headed spiders, babies with bat wings ... their long-dreaded but hotly anticipated rematch with the evil clown Pennywise is like Dali on steroids. It's as if the CGI department has been furiously engineering surrealist mutations for every one of the intervening 27 years. Adding to the classic, more-is-more approach of the Hollywood blockbuster is the considerable baggage each character is lugging from their previous encounter with the supernatural predator. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy), who led the attack against Pennywise in revenge for his baby brother's death, is now a successful author who can't quite nail the endings of his mystery novels, largely because of his unresolved guilt. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) is in an abusive relationship with a jealous, controlling husband which makes sense, given her past history with her father. The adult Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) is handsomely buff, but he's still a fat boy on the inside. And his feelings for Beverly are still unrequited. Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) is a stand-up comic with a secret life.

Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only member of the Losers' Club who has stayed in Derry, having taken it upon himself to monitor events. When it's time, he summons the reluctant heroes back to their home town. In order to vanquish the evil entity known as It, or Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), each of the selectively amnesiac characters must come to terms with key events from their past seldom has pop psychology been so slavishly applied. It Chapter Two has enough flashbacks to trigger an epileptic fit, and not all of these sequences appeared in the previous film. Since each character's showdown with Pennywise is given a similar weight, the film's running time blows out to a whopping two hours and 49 minutes. But while the narrative for this horror film is unnecessarily bloated and Andy Muschietti drops the reins on the action, at times, there are plenty of sequences in which you will find yourself holding your breath and the visual effects department has a ball.

What else to do, then, but ruin it with a sequel? Given the glut of follow-ups in cinemas, one might have thought the industry was getting better at the art of the reheat. It: Chapter 2, despite some strong performances (James McAvoy and Bill Hader to the fore), returns to the bad habits of sequels past by taking the small and perfectly formed elements of the original and blowing them up like Pennywise's red balloons until they go ""Pop!"" Chapter 2 opens with the final scene from the first film, when the gang of young friends, the self-dubbed Losers' Club of bullied kids, swear a blood oath to return to their home town of Derry, Maine, if the child snatching monster they called ""It"" ever came back. As legend has it, Pennywise resurfaces every 27 years. Sure enough, we're transported to the noughties, and the fun fair is in town. After a nasty incident that gives a taste of things to come it is obvious that Pennywise's sleep of the undead is over. Obvious to Mike, that is, the only one of the original bunch not to have moved away from Derry. He sets about assembling the old crowd, all of whom are deeply disturbed by the summons even though their memories of the past have more holes than a clown's bucket. There is fun to be had as we see what became of the titchy heroes and heroine. Bill (James McAvoy), is now a writer; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is a rich designer trapped in a nightmare marriage; Richie (Bill Hader) is still a loudmouth joker only now, as a stand-up, he gets paid for it; Eddie's germophobia remains a close run thing to his coulrophobia, and so on. And what of our old chuckle buddy himself? Pennywise has not aged a day, as is often the deal when you are the embodiment of evil. So the tale begins, with each adult forced to once again confront their worst fears as Pennywise messes with their minds. Chapter 2 is not without its moments (Chastain returning to her childhood home is a corker). But there is too much reliance on special effects, with results that are downright weird, as when the original young cast, now older, are ""digitally de-aged"" for new scenes. The story would shame Scooby Doo, the tone wanders from mocking to menacing, and Chastain screams a lot.

The plot is an all-grown-up echo of 2017's ""It,"" which brought a half-dozen middle school outcasts together to battle a murderous supernatural entity in their hometown of Derry, Maine. Twenty-seven years after the events of Chapter One, the sadistic clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) is back in action, and the so-called ""Losers Club"" is the only team fit to stop him. After a grisly murder opens the film, the one Loser who never left town Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) summons the rest of the club back from their adult lives. In almost every case, the members of the team have matched material success with some sort of poison pill. De facto leader Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a successful author, albeit with a reputation for unsatisfying endings. Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) is a successful standup comedian, but hiding a deep personal secret. Beverly's (Jessica Chastain) success in business is overshadowed by an abusive marriage, and the formerly pudgy Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) has thinned out and bulked up into a wealthy real estate magnate, though he still pines for an unrequited love. Once the gang returns to Derry, suppressed traumatic childhood memories start to come back, but Mike convinces them to stay the course. If they can each find a token of a childhood fear, he explains, an ancient ritual should banish Pennywise for good. From here, ""Chapter Two"" settles into a familiar pattern as each club member revisits a ghost from his or her past to secure an artifact and confront a fear. To make matters worse, the gang's old bully nemesis Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) has escaped the local nuthouse, and along the way, of course, Pennywise tries to counter the Losers' every move. This formula creates endless creepy scenarios, and in most every case, the effects and visuals deliver the goods especially when it comes to Pennywise himself. Fans of the 1990 TV miniseries and Tim Curry may beg to differ, but Skarsgard does an excellent job as the villainous clown. The trouble is that you can pretty much see every scare coming a mile away, and rarely does ""Chapter Two"" develop any real degree of tension. The story also has a way of getting lost in its supernatural ambiguity, and though the theme of confronting fear is salient, dividing it between so many cast members (the Losers Club boasts seven total members) makes it hard to develop any real depth. But to King fans and fans of the first film that may not matter. The cast has changed, but the story is pretty much the same. It's also just as R-rated as the first film, which felt like an adult version of Netflix's"

More epic in both scope and length than its predecessor (the running time outstrips even Tarantino's ultra-indulgent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Andy Muschietti's good-looking sequel has visual style to spare as it pits its now-adult antiheroes against an ever-expanding creepshow of shrieking scary monsters and crawly super creeps. From giant, drooling clowns to grotesque insect apparitions and spiderlike shape-shifters, It Chapter Two doesn't skimp on the funhouse theatrics, even riffing on a quotable moment from John Carpenter's The Thing, which remains a monstrous benchmark for mind-bending 80s horror. Yet in stretching its canvas so far, the film also bursts the balloon-like charm of its predecessor, throwing more at the audience while ultimately landing less of an engaging emotional punch. Twenty-seven years after the Goonies-inflected adventures of the first film, the former members of the Losers' Club from Derry, Maine (now played by a new, grownup cast), have gone their separate ways, all but forgetting the oath they swore about their ghoulish childhood nemesis: ""If it ever comes back, we'll come back too."" Each has their own life, although the past still haunts them. Bill (James McAvoy) is a popular writer who has a problem with endings; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) has swapped an abusive father for an equally toxic husband; Ben (Jay Ryan) is still lovelorn despite remodelling himself as a ripped success story; Eddie (James Ransone) has retreated into risk assessment; Richie (Bill Hader) has funnelled his insecurities into standup comedy; and Stanley (Andy Bean) lives in terror of his childhood nightmare returning. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has stayed in Derry, awaiting an echo of former horrors that will call his comrades to ""come home, come home"". Things start promisingly with a nostalgic roundup that reunites the old gang in a Chinese restaurant, laying the table for what is to come. An encounter with devilish fortune cookies soon mutates into a shiversome set piece, the palpable chills of which are promptly undercut by a reassuring pay-off gag (""Can we get the check?""). This is a recurrent trope: whenever fear rears its ugly head, humour is swiftly deployed to rebalance the upbeat atmosphere, undercutting any genuine sense of dread. The titular beast may feed on fright, but this movie (like its predecessor) doesn't really want to scare us beyond delivering the odd jolt. For all its dark secrets (repressed guilt, violent homophobia, post-traumatic amnesia) and visions of sewers full of dead children, the film retains a mainstream popcorn sensibility, as carnivalesque as Derry's festival fairground. Nods to horror classics abound, from the ripped shower curtain of Psycho to the ""Here's Johnny!"" refrain from The Shining, but once again it's the family-friendly fantasies of Steven Spielberg that cast the longest shadow. From cave-bound Indiana Jones-style action to otherworldly sequences that play out like"
138,SMP_Doc9_IT_Chapter_Two,SMP_Doc9_IT_Chapter_Two,SMP,Horror,Positive,IT_Chapter_Two,"It Chapter Two arrives at the inevitable problem with many a Stephen King adaptation: The more faithful the adaptation, the more it exposes the difficulty of translating King's novels to the big screen. Hollywood tends to transform King's overwhelmingly internal, psychological horror and Tolkienesque fantasy worlds into externalized, supernatural horror with straightforward plot beats. And with It Chapter Two, director Andy Muschietti leans into this urge more than away from it. The result works, because even diced into a series of scary beats, It is still a great story. But it only barely works. The lack of attention paid to It's internality is obvious, especially given the film's runtime of nearly three hours. On the one hand, by splitting his version of It into two separate films, Muschietti has done an admirable, satisfyingly creepy job of commanding the massive blimp of King's 1,400-page 1986 horror classic. King structured his story about a killer shapeshifting clown and the kids who unite to defeat it into two overlapping timelines; the novel switches back and forth between past and present, as the ""Losers Club"" battles the titular evil known as ""It"" as both teens and adults. Muschietti's choice to break the timelines apart was a smart one at least through It Chapter One, which used a nostalgic coming-of-age lens that made the 2017 film a record-breaking smash hit. But on the other hand, most grownups are way more boring than kids and that's ultimately a disadvantage It Chapter Two can't quite overcome. Though Chapter Two spends many of its 165 minutes weaving connections between past and present to make us care about who these kids have grown up to be, it lacks cohesive characterizations or strong emotional connections. For most of Chapter Two's audience, this narrative sloppiness won't matter too much, because the film is well-made and entertaining. It features all kinds of delightfully hallucinogenic imagery, ranging from gore and body horror to phantasmagorical fantasy creatures. It all feels very epic, and it slots in smoothly after Chapter One with little change in tone and ambiance. But the narrative gaps and flaws including a dissatisfying amount of weirdly handled subtext and one brutal, controversial element taken straight from King's novel mean that, for some fans, Chapter Two won't deliver on all its promises of a psychologically complex showdown between bad clown and the adults he traumatized when they were kids. While Chapter Two works perfectly fine as a complement to Chapter One, it still falls short in that the closer our heroes come to triumphing over ""It,"" the further they get from a satisfying conclusion. Stephen King's It centers on an ancient evil that lurks in the cavernous sewers beneath the town of Derry, Maine: a shapeshifting being whose resting form is that of Pennywise the clown (played in Muschietti's films by the ever-menacing Bill Skarsgard). Pennywise, a.k.a. ""It,"" is a terrifying child-eater who resurfaces every 27 years to prey on kids like a viral outbreak, after ""metastasizing"" off the evil of the"

On the plus side, each movie completes multiple character arcs in more or less satisfying ways, understanding that for all of the expensive special effects being displayed on screen, the main quality that makes or breaks a film is whether or not we care about the protagonists. Each one also has an iconic villain at the center of its story, although the baddie in ""It Chapter Two"" is horrifying, while Thanos of the MCU is intended to be more of an intimidating ""final boss"" archetype. Finally each movie, despite the roughly three-hour running time, feels lean; neither drags or feels padded out, but keeps moving along at a brisk clip. On the less flattering side: Each movie works better on an emotional level than a logical one. Picking up where 2017's ""It"" left off, ""Chapter Two"" again directed by Andy Muschietti tells the story of seven adults who have suppressed traumatic memories from their childhoods in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. They are of course forced to confront them when an evil supernatural clown threatens to murder innocent people. As readers of King's novel will know, the cast of characters is extensive. It includes Bill (James McAvoy), a successful writer who had to overcome a debilitating stutter as a child; Richie (Bill Hader), a stand-up comedian whose vulgarity is revealed to be motivated by a secret character trait that serves as one of the film's plot twists (and one of the most notable deviations from previous tellings); Beverly (Jessica Chastain), a fashion designer who was physically and sexually abused by her father; Eddie (James Ransone), a risk assessor who suffers from hypochondria and had an overbearing mother; Ben (Jay Ryan), a wealthy architect who used to be obese; Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the town librarian whose family suffered from drug abuse and still struggles with it himself; and Stanley (Andy Bean), who was frightened and weak as a child and is much the same as an adult. Not surprisingly, a movie that has to juggle so many plot threads at once and that's not including the violent bully Henry (Teach Grant), who went to prison after murdering his father in the first movie will wind up shortchanging a few of them. The big twist about Richie feels underdeveloped, which is a shame given Hader's strong dramatic performance, and the movie's attempts to tie into larger social issues comes across as forced, if well-intentioned. Likewise the movie's attempt to elevate a crucial choice made by Stanley early in the story into something more noble falls flat. In both King's 1986 novel and the 1990 television film, that aspect of Stanley's character felt like a lazy anti-Semitic stereotype. Here it's more respectable, but only makes sense if Stanley knew things that, in plot terms, only another character could possibly have known. These aren't the only story glitches in ""It Chapter Two,"" which too often"

No doubt the movie will give audiences plenty to mull over long after the credits. In the film, the Jeremiah 11:11 Bible verse appears twice before pivotal moments, and there are plenty of other Biblical references to dig into, including an analogy to heaven and hell. Perhaps Jason's ""Jaws"" shirt is a reference to the rocket sweater the little boy wears in ""The Shining"" or it could be a warning about the film's oceanside dangers. In the '80s scene, when young Adelaide walks into the mysterious attraction, the sign welcoming her is that of a Native American in a headdress above the name ""Shaman Vision Quest."" When the family returns to the beach, the sign has been replaced with a more PC-friendly sign bearing a wizard advertising it as ""Merlin's Enchanted Forest,"" a bandaid solution to hiding the racist exterior and the horror inside its halls. As he did with ""Get Out,"" Peele pays significant tribute to the films that have influenced him in ""Us."" Though this time, there doesn't seem to be a consensus. As I spoke with others who saw the movie, we focused on different titles that stood out to us. For me, ""The Shining"" looked to be the film that received the most nods in ""Us,"" including an overhead shot of the Wilson family driving through hilly forests to their vacation home, much like the Torrance family does on the way to the Overlook Hotel. There's also a reference to ""The Shining"" twins, a few architectural and cinematography similarities and, in one shot, Nyong'o charges the camera with a weapon much like Jack Nicholson menacingly drags along an ax in a chase. However, ""Us"" is not just a love letter to one horror movie. Peele also pays tribute to Brian De Palma with a split diopter shot that places both Adelaide and her doppelganger in equal focus for the first time in the movie. There's also a tip of the hat to Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" in terms of dueling balletic styles and a gorgeously choreographed fight scene that looks like a combative pas de deux. This delightfully deranged home invasion-family horror film works because Peele not only knows how to tell his story, he assembled an incredible cast to play two roles. The Wilsons are a picture of an all-American family: a family of four that looks to be middle class, with college-educated (Gabe is wearing a Howard University sweater) parents doting on their two children. Their doppelgangers may look like them and be tied to them in some way, but their lives are inverses of each other, and their existence has been one of limits and misery. It's one of the most poignant analogies of class in America to come out in a studio film in recent memory.

Peele transcends genre limitations, weaving a narrative that chills to the bone while simultaneously prompting audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about themselves and the world around them. The film centers on Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o), a woman haunted by a childhood trauma that resurfaces during a seemingly idyllic family vacation. On a night at the beach, Adelaide's world is turned upside down when she encounters a horrifying doppelganger of herself Red, the leader of a band of monstrous ""tethered,"" subterranean creatures who mirror their surface counterparts. Peele's brilliance lies in his ability to build tension from the very beginning. The film opens with a haunting prologue, foreshadowing the darkness to come. The camerawork, meticulously crafted by Mike Gioulakis, lingers on unsettling details, creating a pervasive sense of unease. The use of color is deliberate, with the vibrant hues of the beach contrasting starkly with the unsettling red jumpsuits worn by the tethered. Nyong'o delivers a career-defining performance. She portrays both Adelaide and Red with an astonishing emotional range. Adelaide is vulnerable and fiercely protective of her family, while Red embodies a chilling blend of rage and despair. We see the remnants of Adelaide's childhood trauma reflected in Red's actions, creating a sense of tragic symmetry. The supporting cast, including Winston Duke as Adelaide's strong-willed husband Gabe and the phenomenal child actors Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, deliver equally compelling performances. ""Us"" is more than just a collection of jump scares. Peele uses the horror genre as a springboard to explore themes of trauma, identity, and societal inequality. The tethered represent the underclass, the forgotten, and the voiceless. Their existence as twisted reflections of the Wilsons becomes a powerful metaphor for the stark disparities that plague contemporary society. The film forces us to confront the consequences of unchecked privilege and the potential for rage to boil over when voices are silenced. Peele doesn't shy away from ambiguity, which ultimately strengthens the film's impact. The ending is open-ended, leaving audiences to ponder the meaning of the events that transpired. This ambiguity allows the film's themes to resonate long after the credits roll. ""Us"" isn't simply a frightening movie; it's a film that lingers in your mind, prompting discussions and introspection. Beyond its social commentary, ""Us"" is a masterclass in suspenseful storytelling. The film is filled with unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience guessing until the very end. The score by Michael Abels perfectly complements the visuals, adding another layer of unease with its discordant sounds and haunting melodies. ""Us"" isn't without flaws. Some viewers might find the film's symbolism overly complex, requiring multiple viewings to fully grasp its nuances. However, these complexities contribute to the film's richness and depth.

On a night at the beach, Adelaide's world is shattered when she encounters Red, a horrifying doppelganger of herself leading a band of monstrous tethered subterranean creatures who mirror their surface counterparts. Peele's brilliance lies not only in his ability to build suspense from the very first frame, but also in his meticulous attention to detail. The film opens with a prologue rich in symbolism a carnival funhouse sequence foreshadowing the twisted reality Adelaide is about to face. Throughout the film, Peele utilizes camerawork to masterful effect. Long, lingering shots create a sense of unease, while quick cuts and dutch angles amplify moments of violence and chaos. The use of color is deliberate, with the vibrant hues of the Santa Cruz boardwalk standing in stark contrast to the unsettling red jumpsuits worn by the tethered. Nyong'o delivers a tour-de-force performance, portraying both Adelaide and Red with an astonishing complexity. Adelaide embodies vulnerability and maternal strength, desperately trying to protect her family from the horrors of the night. Red, on the other hand, is a chilling manifestation of repressed anger and years of subjugation. Nyong'o masterfully portrays the emotional dissonance between the two characters, highlighting the duality that lies at the heart of the film's themes. The supporting cast complements Nyong'o's brilliance Winston Duke brings a quiet strength to his portrayal of Gabe, Adelaide's husband, while Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex deliver exceptional performances as their children, Zora and Jason. ""Us"" is more than just a collection of jump scares. Peele utilizes the horror genre as a springboard to explore themes of social inequality and the long-lasting effects of systemic oppression. The tethered represent the underclass, the voiceless, and the forgotten. Their existence as twisted reflections of the Wilsons becomes a powerful metaphor for the stark disparities that plague contemporary society. Peele forces us to confront the consequences of economic disparity, the silencing of marginalized voices, and the potential for rage to turn violent when a society fails its most vulnerable. The film is rich with symbolism, drawing inspiration from historical events and cultural touchstones. References to the Hands Across America campaign subtly underscore themes of unity and societal fracture. The inclusion of the classic horror film ""Night of the Living Dead"" adds another layer of meaning, prompting viewers to consider the racial subtext often present in zombie narratives.

The doppelgangers, traditionally symbols of the uncanny and unsettling, become a metaphor for the voiceless and oppressed underclass. The tethered, clad in red jumpsuits, evoke images of enslaved people and the ongoing struggle for racial justice. Peele masterfully utilizes foreshadowing and symbolism throughout the film. From the unsettling Hands Across America reference in the opening scene to the inclusion of the classic horror film ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the film subtly nudges viewers to consider the racial subtext often present in genre narratives. Nyong'o delivers a phenomenal performance, portraying both Adelaide and Red with remarkable depth. Adelaide is a complex character a woman haunted by the past yet fiercely protective of her family. Red, on the other hand, embodies a potent mix of rage and desperation, a manifestation of the tethered's collective suffering.

Red (Nyong'o), the leader of the tethered, is a terrifying figure, her raspy voice and scissor-wielding menace undeniable. Yet, the deeper meaning behind these elements remains frustratingly unclear. The film throws out social commentary about class disparity and the dangers of complacency, but these themes never fully coalesce. Peele seems more interested in creating a nightmarish spectacle than in delivering a nuanced critique. This is where Us falters most significantly. The world-building, so crucial for a film with such ambitious thematic goals, feels incomplete. The origins and motivations of the tethered remain shrouded in mystery. How did this underground society form? Why can't they speak clearly? These unanswered questions create plot holes that undermine the film's overall message. The audience is left with more confusion than catharsis, the horror stemming less from the threat itself and more from the narrative's inconsistencies.

The film throws out social commentary about class disparity and the dangers of complacency, but these themes never fully coalesce. While Peele excels at building atmosphere, the world-building in Us feels incomplete. The origins and motivations of the tethered remain frustratingly vague. How did this underground society form? Why can't they speak clearly? These unanswered questions create plot holes that undermine the film's overall message. Furthermore, the tonal shifts between horror and humor feel clumsy. While Get Out masterfully blended these elements, the comedic moments in Us often fall flat, disrupting the tension the film so carefully builds. Take Pluto, the tethered version of Marcus, who communicates solely through barks and growls. While some viewers might find this unsettling, it often comes across as silly, diffusing the film's horrific elements. The performances are undeniably strong. Nyong'o delivers a tour-de-force, imbuing both Adelaide and the menacing Red with distinct personalities and motivations. Duke, Wright Joseph, and Alex are equally compelling as the Wilson family fighting for survival. However, even these stellar performances can't elevate a script that feels more interested in visual spectacle than a cohesive narrative. Ultimately, Us is a frustrating film. It boasts undeniable stylistic flourishes and strong performances, but it struggles to deliver on its social commentary or horror promises. US ultimately fails to resonate on a deeper level, leaving the audience with a sense of disappointment. The film feels like a collection of intriguing ideas that never fully come together, leaving the audience wanting more substance and less style."

In the violent, churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken, he's a suave, power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who, in truth, is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (he's an ex-husband, as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And he's paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a ""preventer"" (""I prevented bad things from happening"") that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regretif he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours he's torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower. First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers' cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding: ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of France's leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on"
151,VGY_Doc2_Taken,VGY_Doc2_Taken,VGY,Action,Negative,Taken,"NEXT out of the January dreg-u-lator: A Liam Neeson thriller so lacking in ambition they should have called it ""Paycheck."" ""Taken,"" one of those Frenchy efforts to do an American-style chase-'em-down and shoot-'em-up, comes from formerly respectable producer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel, whose homegrown, low-budget action thriller ""District B13"" was a lively little collection of stunts. In trying to broaden their scale to interest a big American audience, Besson and Morel are as convincing as Marcel Marceau doing John Wayne. Neeson plays a retired ex-spook trying to mend fences with the teen daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), he had with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), who is still bitter about being neglected during his career as an international undercover agent. We learn that Neeson's Bryan left his teammates in the middle of a mission in Beirut so he could fly 9,000 miles to attend one of his daughter's birthday parties. So which is it: Was he distant or dedicated? And why do his ex-mates think he's such a great guy if he disappears every time he wants to go wrap a present? Bryan is a growly killin' machine trying to find his daughter after she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris. To find his way, he uses a road map of cliches: moldy dialogue (""I will find you. And I will kill you""), improbable escapes from teams of incompetent henchmen (just shoot him in the head, guys don't handcuff him to a loose overhead pipe) and one of those only-in-the-movies sofas that is bulletproof and fluffy at the same time. When the machine guns roar, just get behind one of these babies and watch the air fill with soft, pretty flurries of stuffing. Available at Crate & Gunbarrel. The movie has two tasks: One is to track Neeson's every step as he pieces together the mystery of where his daughter is. The other is to stage cool chases and gunfights. Both the action and the mystery scenes, though, are made up of such choppy, sloppy, laugh-till-you-drop-y elements that I couldn't figure out whether the movie was rushing through the fights to get back to the mystery or vice versa. An example of how the mystery plays out: Bryan plays a tape of a snippet of conversation between his daughter's attackers to one of his fellow spies. The spy tells him that the men are speaking Albanian, identifies what town they're from, guesses what their game is (trafficking in women to turn into prostitutes) and even explains who their crime boss is. I wish I had a Basil Exposition of my own to decode Neeson's accent. The Irish actor chews over his words as though speaking through a mouthful of mashed potatoes. After half an hour, it dawned on me that he might be trying to sound American, although I couldn't be sure. ""You need my permission to leave the coontry?"" he asks. The fights and chases are so scrambled that it's hard to figure out basics such as where"

All he wants is what's best for Kim, his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace). Divorced from her mother and overshadowed by her filthy-rich stepfather, he would, he says, ``sacrifice anything for her.'' Specifically, he would kill each and every scum he meets in Paris. The number he does on the City of Lights is comparable, corpse-for-corpse, to any damage wreaked by Jason Bourne. With one key difference: Jason has a conscience, or wishes he did. Bryan has none. I mean none. The only life that means anything to him is Kim's, and when she gets nabbed by Albanian sex traffickers on a trip abroad, Bryan hops on a plane and lays waste to gay Paree. ""You can't just run around tearing up Paris!"" whines a French colleague (Olivier Rabourdin). Au contraire, Bryan says: ""I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to."" Clench-jawed action star is a new gig for Neeson, but the Man Who Was Schindler has long worn the mantle of heroism. The twist this time is an utter lack of moral complexity. He's a dad, and he's a killing machine, and that's it. This blindered characterization makes for a driving premise and a few interesting scenes, but it gets to be a bore after the shock wears off. If he'll kill or maim just about anyone, where's the suspense? It's less Neeson's fault, or even director Pierre Morel's, than the movie's co-writers: Robert Mark Kamen and the entertainingly shlocky Luc Besson, who also produced. The Besson-Kamen writing team gave us The Fifth Element, all three Transporters and, most recently, a little Norwegian-Mexican comic Western called Bandidas. They're just the men for high-gloss knockabout bloodshed. So Bryan shoots people. He knifes them. He snaps their necks, sprays them with hot steam and chases them onto highway ramps where they're conveniently smooshed by oncoming traffic. He electrocutes a guy for information, then flips on the switch and leaves. He wings a lady whose only crime is cooking him a nice chicken dinner and being married to the wrong man.The film's single most effective scene is the tense trans-Atlantic sequence when Kim, on the phone with her father, sees her airhead friend (Katie Cassidy) abducted in a Parisian flat and realizes the kidnappers are coming for her next. As Bryan instructs his daughter to scream identifying characteristics (height, hair color, tattoos) into her cell, the camera looks squarely at Neeson's pale brow and watery blue eyes. He doesn't cry; his face is gripped not by immobilizing grief but by pragmatism, professionalism and the need to act immediately. After he arrives in France, there's a bit of quirk with a fellow hired to translate Albanian. What a nifty touch hey, Bourne never hired a temp. For a minute there, movie begins to approximate real-world logic. But then Bryan starts arguing with the Albanians in English, and they argue back in English, and at no"
153,VGY_Doc4_Taken,VGY_Doc4_Taken,VGY,Action,Negative,Taken,"Trashy paranoid thriller directed by Frenchman Pierre Morel (""The Transporter""/""District B13""). The preposterous script is by Frenchman Luc Besson (who specializes in Eurotrash) and the American Robert Mark Kamen. The 56-year-old talented Irish thesp Liam Neeson steps down from his more arty pics and takes a turn as a James Bond type of action hero and single-handedly brings down a dangerous foreign crime ring on their turf, if you can believe. If escapist fantasy films that are fast-paced, filled with well-staged testosterone-driven action and you don't mind that it's not-to-be-taken seriously for even a sec, then this entertaining but mindless roller coaster ride of a taut film is probably just right for you. I found it too absurd to be 'taken' in by it, even its best assetits skill in filmmaking techniques left me thinking more bad trip than going with its adrenaline high. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA agent, who is divorced from his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). She's remarried to the tycoon Stuart (Xander Berkeley) and lives a life of pleasure in Los Angeles, while Bryan barely gets by on his pension. Doting estranged father Bryan just lives for his now 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), an aspiring pop singer, as he retired early because he missed following his daughter grow up and now wishes to make up for years of parental neglect due to career obligations. Against her overbearing dad's advice, the underaged Kim without an adult chaperone goes for a summer holiday with her teenager girlfriend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to Paris (which is viewed as a terrifying place by the spy and that teens on holiday can't be trusted to behave without supervision) when she agrees to his strict set of rules. As soon as Kim arrives in Paris for her summer vacation, a spotter (Nicolas Giraud) for an Albanian white slaver ring orchestrates the kidnapping of the two girls from their luxurious residence. The spy hears all this on the special cell phone he laid on his daughter and rushes to Paris, as his CIA pals in L.A. tell him he has at best 96 hours to save her from being swept away to a life of prostitution. Since Bryan seems to be the only one in the world capable of retrieving his daughter, he goes it solo. Just before he goes on his mission, he lets the kidnappers know that he has ""a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. . . . I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you."" If you don't find this silly and that the filmmakers are just cynically manipulating US foreign prejudices for this blockbuster entertainment spectacle to cash in, then you might as well sit back, relax and watch Neeson kick-ass with his repertoire of judo skills that he expertly does without making a fool of himself (also once in a"
154,VGY_Doc5_Taken,VGY_Doc5_Taken,VGY,Action,Negative,Taken,"ONE of the side effects of September 11, 2001, is a general hardening of attitudes towards foreigners and foreign parts in American movies. There has always been no place like home; now you might die if you leave it. Bad guys are even more likely than before to be from some other place, even in a film set in the US. A number of recent horror films have shown young Americans how scary Europe is, never mind the Middle East. Hostel and Hostel: Part II dramatised a post-Cold War nightmare, in which parts of eastern Europe had become kidnap-and-kill zones for US kids. The three Bourne films went deeper into the idea of dangerous Europe but they suggested that American intelligence services were reaping a bitter harvest for their own excesses. Jason Bourne was one of theirs, after all: a brainwashed CIA killer gone off the leash. The Bourne movies have been very influential in terms of style and they made a lot of money but that questioning of American hegemony probably irked a few studio executives. They were also a bit highbrow as action movies go and not quite patriotic. Taken would be more to the studios' taste, because all the non-Americans in the film are basically awful and untrustworthy and an ex-CIA man is the hero. We get bloodthirsty Albanian mafia guys with long greasy hair and corrupt cheese-eating French bureaucrats in suits. Eventually, the usual suspects appear - swarthy men from the south, speaking Arabic. Someone needs to sort them out - this time it's Liam Neeson, who's not really seen as foreign, even though he's Northern Irish. The irony is that Taken was directed and co-written by two Frenchmen (plus one American). The prolific Luc Besson co-wrote the script with Robert Mark Kamen, the veteran American action writer of the three Karate Kid films. The director is French cameraman Pierre Morel, working for Besson's Europa Corp, in partnership with Twentieth Century Fox. In fact, this is largely a French movie tricked up to look like American action and calculated to appeal to American sentimentalism. It's a pretty cynical exercise all round because there's a fair bit of contempt for American values as well, even as it reaches into American pockets. You can see that in the way the film portrays Neeson's character and his relationship with his daughter, a 17-year-old princess called Kim, or Kimmy (Maggie Grace). Neeson is Bryan, a retired CIA man. He has moved to Los Angeles to be near her, after his ex-wife has remarried. He feels guilty about all the years he wasn't around. Kim lives with her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen, who's actually Dutch) and Stuart the millionaire (Xander Berkeley). On Kim's 17th birthday, Bryan turns up with a karaoke machine, because she wants to be a singer. Stuart gives her a pony. Her shrieks of delight can be heard in Paris - which is where she wants to go for a holiday with her close friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy),"
155,VGY_Doc6_Taken,VGY_Doc6_Taken,VGY,Action,Positive,Taken,"So many movies are well intended but poorly made that when something like ""Taken"" comes along, it's a relief, almost a joy. There's nothing lofty in the intentions of ""Taken."" The aspiration here was to make a simple, straight-ahead action thriller. Period. But if you think that's easy, think of all the lousy action thrillers that come out in the course of a year. The level of skill that went into ""Taken"" is masterly. This is a picture that will appeal mainly to people who love movies, and I use the word ""love"" advisedly. Viewers who love movies for their true soul - for their obviousness, for their manipulations, for their corniness, for their blend of high and low emotion - will take great pleasure in ""Taken."" Others, who like movies conditionally, like a wayward lover they hope to reform, may end up hating ""Taken"" - or at least thinking of it as something stupid, ridiculous, far-fetched and worthless. Which reminds me of a story: When I was 6, all the kids I knew used to watch the TV show ""Batman."" We took it very, very seriously. Then, at around 7, we realized it was ridiculous. Then, when we were around 9, we realized it was intended to be ridiculous, and we liked it again. At 7, we thought we were quite sophisticated, but, it turned out, there were higher levels of appreciation. ""Taken"" requires that higher level of appreciation. In terms of pace and economy, it's beautiful to behold. Director Pierre Morel, working from a script by Robert Mark Kamen (""The Fifth Element"") and Luc Besson, knows when to slow down and lavish time on characters to establish the emotions and motivations that are going to give the action its urgent undercurrent. Liam Neeson plays Brian, a nice, easygoing fellow whose main mission in life, as the film starts, is to rekindle a relationship with his teenage daughter. Apparently, he was a workaholic who neglected his family and wrecked his marriage, but he's determined to keep that one flickering connection alive and thriving. Oh, yes, and it turns out that he's a former CIA agent. Of course he is. What did you think, that this movie was going to be some boring thing about a family? Wake up and smell the explosions! So what happens next? How do the screenwriters connect the dedicated-father angle with the former CIA-agent angle? Three guesses. ... What, you only needed one guess? That's right, the daughter is taken and borne away by an international cabal of criminals. Anyone could devise this premise. The real measure of ""Taken"" is not in what happens but in how it happens. Observe, for example, the intelligent construction of the abduction scene. Notice how the design of the apartment (from which the girl is taken) and the use of the victim's perspective contribute to the tension. Take note of the sheer cleverness of the filmmakers' choosing to have it all happen while the girl is on the phone,"
156,VGY_Doc7_Taken,VGY_Doc7_Taken,VGY,Action,Positive,Taken,"Who knew Liam Neeson, the same highly regarded actor who's made a living starring in such sophisticated and acclaimed films as ""Schindler's List,"" ""Nell,"" ""Rob Roy"" and ""Kinsey,"" could be so convincing as a kick-butt-and-take-names-later action hero? We all know that Neeson can act, and act extremely well, but I can't fault anyone for thinking he might be a little out of place in director Pierre Morel's ""Taken,"" a fast and furious offspring of the ""Bourne"" franchise and the television show ""24."" It's easy to doubt Neeson's ability to pull off such a role because he's never really done it before (Sorry, but I don't count ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace""), and let's be honest here, how many 56-year-old actors can effectively play a tough-as-nails vigilante who can easily take down loads of evil thugs half his age? It is often said you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and fortunately Neeson has made the most of his initial offering to the action genre. In fact, a large part of the appeal of ""Taken"" comes from Neeson and the credibility he brings to a film that oftentimes deals with preposterous and unrealistic situations. That's not to take anything away from today's top action stars - Jason Statham, Vin Diesel or Mark Wahlberg, to name a few - but it is very rare that action junkies like myself get to experience watching an actor with the same demanding screen presence and swagger as Neeson. The gravitas and complexity that is provided by Neeson actually ends up adding an extra layer of depth to ""Taken,"" and his memorable performance will make you wish he would've considered dabbling with the action genre a whole lot sooner in his career. With that said, it should come as no surprise that he seems right at home playing Bryan Mills, a newly retired CIA operative who left his job and moved to Los Angeles so he could be closer to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, formerly of the television series ""Lost""), much to the chagrin of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and her new, filthy rich husband (Xander Berkeley). Kim may be happy that Bryan wants to be a part of her life, but the thing she wants more than anything is for him to sign a permission slip that will allow her to spend the summer in Paris with her girlfriend. As an overprotective father who has seen the worst the world has to offer, Bryan is reluctant to potentially put his daughter in harm's way, but, after all, he wants to stay on her good side so he eventually caves in to her request. However, daddy apparently knows best because soon after Kim and her friend arrive in the City of Lights, they are abducted by a mysterious bunch of Albanians who are so merciless even the Russians give them a wide berth. But if you think the kidnappers are going to get away with their"
157,VGY_Doc8_Taken,VGY_Doc8_Taken,VGY,Action,Positive,Taken,"""Taken's"" greatest asset resides within the perfectly cast Liam Neeson and the deliberate build of his fascinatingly merciless character. Rather than jump directly into the advertised plot, the film is careful to explore the anti-hero's troubled relationships and hint at the dark past that allows him to transform into the ruthlessly efficient soldier requisite for the task at hand. Halfway through the film, when audiences discover to what extent the protagonist is willing to go to accomplish his mission, it's impossible not to be engaged in his brutally unrelenting plight. Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job of long hours and dangerous work in an attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But with a restrictive ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and his naturally overprotective impulses, he finds the young woman drifting further away. Not wanting to compound their strained relationship, Bryan reluctantly permits Kim to vacation in Paris, giving her more freedom than he's comfortable with. Things quickly spiral out of control when she's kidnapped by Albanian slave traders from her hotel room. Now, in a desperate and deadly quest, Bryan will stop at nothing to track down those responsible, to save his daughter from the clutches of a depraved organization. Luc Besson certainly has an obsession with shady men with checkered pasts, forced to delve into disturbing criminal underworlds to seek redemption and vigilante justice. Antiheroes come in many styles, and although some critics may scour at unoriginal aspects of Liam Neeson's Bryan, the man still knows how to be a badass. In the rescue of his daughter, he has no limits; this creates many unexpected scenes of exercising an iron will and a frightening determination, which finds a seemingly heroic man donning a guise of villainy. And yet, all of it feels righteous it's a testament to character design when the hero can remain a hero even after viciously torturing criminals or shooting innocent people to force a few quick answers. He may not be entirely unique, but this hardboiled, unflinching ""preventer"" is simply fixating. ""Taken"" is an action film connoisseur's perfect guilty pleasure. Bubbling over with chase sequences, shootouts (the kind where the baddies supply all the firepower), and fistfights, it takes on a realism not found in many of the action-for-the-sake-of-action flicks of recent years. Bryan's hand-to-hand combat skills don't rely on flamboyant or showy martial arts, instead taking a more realistic approach, with plenty of one-hit takedowns and throat-chops that effectively subdue the enemy in a stealthier manner. The authenticity of it all may be negotiable, but it's refreshing to see simpler forms of attacking and defending and it's certainly more believable when random gun-toting henchmen aren't prepared with perfect kung-fu fighting techniques to combat the specially trained protagonist. ""Taken"" prides itself on its serious, dark tone. The villains' atrocities are amplified by their detestable trade; they will receive no sympathy from viewers when they get what's coming to them. The hero is also rather remorseless, stopping at"
158,VGY_Doc9_Taken,VGY_Doc9_Taken,VGY,Action,Positive,Taken,"I have to admit, when Luc Besson sits down to invest in an offering of buttery popcorn entertainment, it's an occasion to celebrate. Flipping through the likes of ""District B13,"" ""High Tension,"" ""The Transporter,"" and ""Kiss of the Dragon,"" it's obvious Besson has a skill for picking out tight, twisted, lovable distractions, and ""Taken"" takes a welcome spot on his mantle of achievements. It's an inconsequential action diversion, but damn does it pack a wallop over 90 taut, tempting Liam Neesony minutes. Bryan (Liam Neeson) is a father trying to stay invested in his estranged teen daughter's (Maggie Grace, 25 unconvincingly playing 17) lush life, putting aside his covert work for the government to make nice with his ex (Famke Janssen) and rebuild relationships. Reluctantly agreeing to send his child off to Paris for a summer trip, Bryan is confronted with his worst fear when the girl is kidnapped by Albanian thugs. Shedding his suburban exterior, Bryan launches into offensive mode, traveling to France with his only goal being the retrieval of his daughter. Stepping into the human trafficking underworld, Bryan is confronted with absolute horror and Euro threat, but nothing can stop his frantic hunt. The one quality that defines the ""Taken"" experience is simplicity. Glorious simplicity. Besson and co-writer Robert Mark Kamen script a revenge story that's built entirely from nuts of aggression and bolts of panic, developing a tale of parental love that stays the course of suspense to the very end. ""Taken"" is a low-cal dream thrill ride, best appreciated after years of explosion-happy Hollywood blunders, traditionally cluttered with superfluous subplots and unnecessary build up to flaccid finales. ""Taken"" certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's delightfully agile and bullet-ready determined, aiming to cram all the rage it possibly can into 90 minutes without taking its eyes off of Neeson and his beautifully intimidating performance. The director of ""Taken"" is Pierre Morel, the filmmaker behind ""District B13"" and a man who prefers to keep his havoc blunt. Following Besson and Kamen's broad lead, Morel dreams up an obstacle course for Bryan as he works his way from the initial interpretation of the crime (through a cell phone recording and help from C.I.A. friends) to the lawless streets of Paris, where Albanian criminal slime rule the streets with their alarming human trafficking scheme. Chasing a sublime Charles Bronson tone (albeit crossbred with Jason Bourne), Morel turns in an exquisitely lean motion picture, nimbly jumping from location to location without the natural hum of the piece interrupted. Morel understands ""Taken"" is the Liam Neeson show and adjusts accordingly, keeping Bryan's worry as fine tuned as his wrath, giving the actor plenty of room to play as he maneuvers around cliches and stock villain characters. After a 30 minute introductory period, ""Taken"" tears off into an investigative fury, following Bryan as he inches closer to his daughter's whereabouts, using and abusing local cops and robbers as he sees fit. Again, ""Taken"" is not high-art, not especially logical, and doesn't"

A movie with less interest in character development and dialogue than in roundhouse kicks and gunplay, Taken is brutish and loud and slow in parts, but also undeniably entertaining. The presence of Liam Neeson in the lead role is a bonus, but surprisingly, not really the source of success. Credit goes to Pierre Morel, the director who previously made the gonzo French action movie District B13 and brings the same frenetic, sadistic energy to the manifold action sequences here. The plot takes forever to get going, and suffers throughout from terrible dialogue and ridiculous twists, but when it comes to the action-- which is why you bought the ticket in the first place, of course-- Morel is completely in charge.. But first, there's an interminable half hour or so spent meeting Bryan Mills (Neeson), a former spy now living in Los Angeles in order to be closer to his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives with her mom (Famke Janssen) and a rich stepdad who buys her a pony for her 16th birthday. Mills, poor guy, can only afford a karaoke machine. We needlessly watch Mills return briefly to the job to protect a pop star-- and take down an assailant in the process-- and hang out with his old spy buddies, since apparently screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen took the ""show, don't tell"" method of exposition way, way too seriously. The plot finally emerges when Kim asks permission to spend the summer in Paris, and Mills, an insanely overprotective father, denies her at first. She then confirms the worst suspicions of every overprotective parent on earth by getting kidnapped, along with her friend Amanda, within minutes of arriving in Paris. After a frantic phone call with Kim that gives a few key clues about the kidnappers, Mills has packed his toolkit of weapons and jetted overseas, preparing to ""tear down the EIffel Tower if I have to"" in order to find his daughter. He stops just short of that, but destroys any number of cars, construction sites, and lives as he races through the seedy underbelly of Paris. He determines Kim and Amanda have been taken by Albanian traffickers, who kidnap unassuming young women and, usually within 70 hours, ship them away forever. A number of plot threads that might give more insight into this under-discussed, tragic world are abandoned, including an odd moment when Mills cares for a kidnapped woman whom he first thinks is Kim. There's also an encounter in which Mills' French government contact appears to be in cahoots with the traffickers, but that's mostly an excuse for Mills to throw a few more punches and track another clue. The action, though sometimes over-edited and confusing, is mostly thrilling, including an early chase scene at a construction site and a final confrontation on a boat in the Seine. Neeson is such an automatically empathetic figure that he gets away with"

Its punchlines are recognizable from a distance as the volcano dominating the remote island where most of the story takes place. This is a movie you can get a clear sense of from its opening moments, every beat clearly telegraphed. There is, however, a significant amount of comfort and delight in all this familiarity. Directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee understand exactly what their audience wantsmuch like a good romance novelist mightand deliver an undeniably charming (and refreshingly IP-free) romantic romp. This is a movie you watch in the theater, with popcorn, then again and again on streaming, with a glass of wine. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a burnt-out romance writer whose grief after the loss of her husband threatens to derail her career. Her disdain for her books is only matched by her dislike of their cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), a seemingly dim beefcake who indulges her readers at signing events. After an event promoting her latest book, Loretta is abducted by explorer/rich guy Abigail (it's a gender-neutral name, apparently) Fairfax, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fairfax knows that the lost city from Loretta's book is real, and he wants her to translate some ancient writing that leads to a treasure before a volcano erupts and covers the whole thing. Alan mounts an ill-advised expedition to save Loretta, with help from his meditation guru, Jack (Brad Pitt), and Loretta's beleaguered editor Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). Loretta and Alan's eventual romance is unavoidable, but ""The Lost City"" does a great job exploring the mounting chemistry between Bullock and Tatum's characters. In particular, the movie highlights Alan's emotional intelligence and unwavering support. He may be the kind of guy who refers to Loretta as a ""human mummy,"" but he also knows she gets cranky without snacks, and that she could use a slightly more sensible pair of shoes traversing all that rocky terrain. Like many a beloved romantic hero, Alan is not only a gorgeous man, he's a man who cares. Tatum is great casting for a role like this on several levels; not only does he look like he belongs on the cover of a romance paperback, he's also an actor who understands his own appeal and has proven time and again that he isn't afraid to play it for laughs. Bullock is also more than happy to play into her character's physical awkwardness and eventual shedding of her prickly exteriorit's not exactly unfamiliar territory for her, either. Together, the pair exude fun and a sense of affection that's easy to get caught up in. Other members of the supporting cast, particularly a very welcome Patti Harrison as Loretta's hysterically self-involved social media manager, add bright, bizarre punches of humor to a script that otherwise plays it by the numbers (oddly, this isn't a criticism, ""The Lost City"" is working with an effective formula). Radcliffe is the only"
161,ZFF_Doc2_The_Lost_City,ZFF_Doc2_The_Lost_City,ZFF,Comedy,Positive,The_Lost_City,"Romantic comedies, better known as rom-coms, are a genre I've grown to appreciate more and more. As an advocate that all kinds of stories are necessary for a more complete film education, the comfort of being able to watch a light, fun flick, even if it's not innovative, is a positive feeling that can often transform a dull day into a joyful one. Depending on the taste of each viewer, some prefer more romance, some prefer more comedy, but in the end, what matters the most is the movie delivering enough entertainment and inspiring lessons. Add an adventure component, and the results are films like The Lost City. No viewer enters the theater to watch a rom-com expecting to witness the most impressive narrative ever. Predictably, The Lost City follows the usual formula of the genre: two protagonists who couldn't be more different and/or hate each other have to face an unexpected situation, getting closer and truly getting to know each other, ultimately creating a deep bond that results in passion and love. This work from brothers Aaron and Adam Nee (Band of Robbers) doesn't escape the admittedly cliche structure, but their screenplay co-written with Oren Uziel (Escape Room: Tournament of Champions) and Dana Fox (Cruella) has enough variations of the generic elements to create a very entertaining movie. With a particular focus on deceptive appearances, The Lost City offers two main characters with relatable motivations and distinct personalities that combine hilariously well. Alan, a seemingly goofy cover model, and Loretta, the depressed author of the most popular romantic novel franchise, are brilliantly portrayed by Channing Tatum (Dog) and Sandra Bullock (The Unforgivable). The actors share a lot of chemistry in roles that force them to have moments where they need to be immensely comfortable with their co-star, and both show extraordinary ease, in addition to superb comic performances. The main plot may lack imagination, but care wasn't lacking in the treatment of the protagonists nor in the comedic adventure sequences. Genuine laughter hits double digits primarily due to the unexpected conclusions of certain scenes. However, the biggest surprise of The Lost City turns out to be the excellent development given to the arcs of Alan and Loretta that, in fact, convinces the audience of the eventual evolution of their relationship. When it comes to the rest of the cast and respective storylines, only Brad Pitt (Ad Astra) stands out in a positive manner. Despite the short screen time and the clear objective of simply showing up to perform an action sequence, the actor is truly hilarious in his few minutes of presence. On the other hand, everything secondary in The Lost City lacks appeal and entertainment value. Daniel Radcliffe (Guns Akimbo) is too talented to be hanging around like a cartoonish villain who strangely disappears during the second act after providing the obligatory cheap exposition for the audience to immediately understand where the film is headed. As much as I was incredibly pleased to see Oscar Nunez (The Office)"
162,ZFF_Doc3_The_Lost_City,ZFF_Doc3_The_Lost_City,ZFF,Comedy,Positive,The_Lost_City,"The Lost City is a terrific throwback to studio romcoms of the 90s and 00s, with two true-blue movie star performances from Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. As superhero films strengthened their grip on the industry, one of the first genres for studios to no longer deem a ""theatrical necessity"" was the romantic comedy. Nowadays, most people get their romcom fix from Netflix (Set it Up, Always Be My Maybe, etc.) but there was a time not so long ago when movies like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, and Pretty Woman could pair a couple of movie stars (Will Smith, Julia Roberts, etc.) with a creative concept and make nearly $200 million at the domestic box office, packing in crowds like a Marvel movie. Cut to 2022 and, extraordinary exceptions like 2018's Crazy Rich Asians aside, most romcoms simply can't compete with the IP-driven titles that have theaters in a chokehold; despite being critically acclaimed, 2017's The Big Sick and 2019's Long Shot, for instance, barely registered with average audiences. However, that doesn't mean some romcom aficionados aren't still trying to keep the genre alive. Just this February, we saw the release of the Jennifer Lopez's Marry Me (co-starring Loki's Owen Wilson as her mismatched love interest), and the multihyphenate even has another due for June Shotgun Wedding, co-starring Transformers' Josh Duhamel. But, before that, this month brings us the long-awaited The Lost City, which not only gives Sandra Bullock yet another starring role in one of the genres she's most famous for (While You Were Sleeping, The Proposal, you know the rest) but also, along with last month's Dog, serves as co-star Channing Tatum's triumphant return to live-action cinema, having been absent since 2017's Kingsman: The Golden Circle. On paper, The Lost City looks like the kind of thing that used to be Hollywood's bread-and-butter a old-fashioned ""movie movie"" based around an original idea and led by two mega stars with clearly defined public personas who lure in audiences despite the lack of IP. And, in execution, it's every bit the exuberant big-screen entertainment you'd expect it to be. We start on Loretta Sage (Bullock), a dissatisfied, middle-aged author who, following the death of her husband and her inability to publish a book on their archeological findings, turned to writing romance-adventure novels centered around a beautiful and brooding fictional hero named Dash (who is given a vibrant visage by clueless cover model Alan Caprison, played by Tatum). But now, Loretta's found herself in a rut; aside from rarely (if ever) leaving her house, she's grown disenchanted with the series as a whole, and she wants this latest book which she's about to leave for a book tour on to be her last. That doesn't sit well with Alan (who relies on this job since he can't really do anything else) and her brassy publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, of Dolemite Is My Name and Office Christmas Party), but before they can voice too many frustrations, Loretta is kidnapped"
163,ZFF_Doc4_The_Lost_City,ZFF_Doc4_The_Lost_City,ZFF,Comedy,Positive,The_Lost_City,"Sandra Bullock seems legitimately depressed in the early scenes of The Lost City. She's playing Dr. Loretta Sage, a bestselling romantic-adventure novelist whose archaeologist husband died five years ago. Since then, Loretta has barely left the house, and she's no longer feeling the Romantic Adventure she's thinking of retiring her Romantic Adventurers Lovemore and Dash, which would be a bummer for hunky but doofy model Alan (Channing Tatum), who poses as Dash on the covers of Loretta's books. Anyway, Bullock has been altogether too grim in recent years, what with Gravity, Bird Box, and The Unforgivable, so I was worried about her demeanor here until I remembered the film was following the familiar Romancing the Stone template, where the novelist must break through her emotional hindrances and embrace, well, Romance and Adventure. As it is, I don't think Bullock even laughs until almost the end. That doesn't mean she isn't entertaining, though. The Lost City is the sort of bubbly, unchallenging studio plaything that some of us may receive gratefully in these harrowed times. Will I watch it again? Maybe not; not when I can rewatch Romancing the Stone or, for that matter, Raiders of the Lost Ark. But it's a mild mood enhancer if you just hand yourself over to it and say, Okay, movie, do your thing. There may be long stretches where you forget the official plot and just roll with the gently funny rapport between Bullock and Tatum. I liked that Loretta is still too fogged up by grief to notice that the younger, dishy Alan seems to be crushing on her; I liked the movie's nods to LGBTQ+ representation in the persons of Bowen Yang and Patti Harrison as satellites publicizing Loretta's book. The movie feels somewhat canned but is also good-hearted. The only significant blood we ever see is part of an abrupt joke I won't spoil. So this is an old-school adventure, with caves and underwater tunnels and, as advertised, a lost city on a remote island, a city that skunky billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) wants to discover. To that end, he kidnaps Loretta, figuring she can translate a bit of parchment that might lead to the city and its possible treasure. Wanting to establish himself as Loretta's hero, Alan follows, and the two are soon bumbling through the jungle, doing battle with leeches and sharing a hammock that really only fits one. The awkwardness with which Loretta extricates herself from the hammock while trying not to awaken Alan is an example of the unnecessary but welcome gestures towards realistic discomfiture sprinkled throughout the film. Alan is always jumping into derring-do situations and finding himself not up to the task. This isn't a cruelly gritty deconstruction of adventure, though, so we simply read it as comedic misadventure. The Lost City is the sort of amiable, star-centered bonbon that used to make modest-to-surprising profits in a more lenient age for movies. Sadly, it may not have cleared enough to call for a sequel,"
164,ZFF_Doc5_The_Lost_City,ZFF_Doc5_The_Lost_City,ZFF,Comedy,Positive,The_Lost_City,"Some viewers might find adventure rom-com The Lost City smarmy and off-putting, while others will sink into its warm bath of tropes with pleasure and relief. But the film is about that same tension. It's been widely hailed as a retread of Romancing the Stone (itself a riff on The African Queen and Raiders of the Lost Ark), but I think a better comparison is the recent Jumanji reboot, which sets a group of stock characters in search of an exotic McGuffin, but which explicitly frames its cartoonish action as video gameplay, and its characters as players whose familiarity with the game clashes with the incongruity of their underlying 'real selves'. Similarly, The Lost City begins with a delightful sequence lampooning romantic adventure storytelling, which turns out to be the projected imagination of jaded romance author Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), who's stuck on the ending of her latest novel, The Lost City of D. If that cheap joke doesn't raise a smirk, this film probably isn't for you but I saw it in a cinema filled with women who'd been enjoying free cocktails in the foyer, which is the right and proper viewing experience. The Lost City is a story about the vicarious pleasures of romance fiction, and about the folly of either dismissing them as stupid or of taking them too seriously. The film amiably indulges corny tropes forced proximity! Tending wounds! A hardened heart learns to love again! There's only one hammock! while also incorporating its audience's resistance to them. And it tests, and resolves, the story's conflicts between brains and body, reality and fantasy, and contempt and respect, using the personas its stars have both honed over long, successful careers. So, if you feel romance fiction is beneath you, here's Bullock as Loretta, a self-professed 'sapiosexual' whose escapist novels star a brilliant female archaeologist and her hunky sidekick, Dash whom the Fabio-esque hunk Alan (Channing Tatum) portrays on her book covers. Still mourning her archaeologist husband, Loretta dismisses her books as trash and despises her rapturously horny female fans, who wish they could feel the fictitious Dash beneath them. Her latest book tour stop, at a romance convention, is going as awkwardly as expected, despite the best efforts of her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and social media manager Allison (Patti Harrison), who push Loretta onstage in a sequined fuchsia jumpsuit that's memorable enough to get its own plotline. Loretta storms out, and Alan follows her to declare his longstanding crush ... only to witness hired goons bundling her into a black SUV. Her kidnapper is Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) 'it's a gender-neutral name!' a scion of a billionaire family who's still seething that the company was passed to his brother. Unlike most of Loretta's fans, Abigail has read her novel The Lost City of D with a nerd's eye. He's convinced that the city is real, that it hides a priceless jewelled crown buried in a grieving queen's tomb, and that with her archaeological knowledge, Loretta"

It isn't that I haven't enjoyed her presence onscreen. It's just that on her own, she doesn't feel like a supernova; she dims or brightens by virtue of whom she is acting against. When it's Keanu Reeves? That's when she truly shines, in movies like 1994's Speed, where her determination and wit perfectly flirt with Reeves's doting machismo. (I even have a soft spot for their dynamic in the admittedly weird 2006 romantic drama, The Lake House.) She has the appropriate charm in Miss Congeniality, a 2000 film that again highlights her prickly steadfastness while giving her physical comedy alongside seasoned scene partners like Michael Caine and Candice Bergen. In 2013's Gravity, her drive is so well-harnessed that the chemistry she cultivates with George Clooney persists long after he disappears. But as an unyielding matriarch in The Blind Side, a 2009 film built on baldly uncomfortable racial politics that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar, she fails to feel whole or engaging. As the supposed center of the film, she lacks any force beyond curdling white saviorism. The Lost City, released this weekend, is the kind of film meant to rest on the laurels of star power. Not just Bullock's, but her immediate cast members', too. The film which scans as Romancing the Stone cosplay updated for the current moment is the kind of romantic action-adventure caper we haven't seen in decades. It doesn't waste time. At a fleet 92 minutes, the film dives into a story about Loretta Sage (Bullock), a highly successful romance novelist whose life has been defined by loneliness since the death of her beloved husband. Her apparent knowledge of a lost city reflected in her swooning recent book gets her kidnapped by a madcap, disgruntled billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) who believes she can locate the priceless treasure he's been spending oodles of cash to find. Loretta proves to be more capable than her captors realize, and she's not alone the sweet himbo who models on her covers, Alan (Channing Tatum), sets out to save her, leading to high jinks and, theoretically at least, romantic sparks set against the backdrop of a dangerous jungle on a forgotten island. ""The movie comes with an additional set of stakes specific to Hollywood's post-pandemic future,"" the New York Times' Kyle Buchanan posits. ""As the theatrical business constricts, will people still go see an old-fashioned comic adventure where the actors lack any superpowers besides A-list charisma?"" Here's the problem. The Lost City may have the A-listers, but it doesn't possess the craft necessary to spotlight their skills. Audiences shouldn't be blamed if they are cold to the film. How can we expect people to respond to adult movies like this if they lack the charm of the genres they're plundering for inspiration? The Lost City isn't terrible, just aggressively mediocre. It is the kind of movie you put on in the background after coming"

Curiosity rarely kills the movie watcher; the worst it can lead to is disappointment. Aaron and Adam Nee's The Lost City, involves a treasure hunt. So I will admit: the film held my attention far longer than I expected it to. Who does not like a good old big-screen Legends of the Hidden Temple-style chase through mountains and caves in the quest for some elusive prize once in a while? All I had to do was adjust to the persistent sense of deja vu I had all through watching it. (Please note, I do not use the word 'persistent' lightly.) There is a Channing Tatum taking his shirt off. There is a wise-ass Sandra Bullock in a crisis. Bullock has literally made a wise-ass film called Our Brand Is Crisis (2015), and I believe her. Throw in a journey to a mysterious island. Has there been a movie about a Journey 2 some Mysterious Island before? I do not know, you tell me. I was almost certain a Rock would show up. (Chris or The - take your pick.) Let me deja vu you some more. Bullock plays Loretta Sage, an author who is forced by a mysterious rich fellow into an adventure-filled quest because her latest book contains symbols that indicate she might be able to translate a treasure map. Unlike Robert Langdon, Loretta has no real interest in such pursuits. She would rather just sort her mid-life crisis out. Unfortunately, just like the deja vu, the wealthy tyke is persistent. Daniel Radcliffe walks straight out of Now You See Me 2, and into this film to play this particularly smarmy character with daddy issues. Surely, Michael Caine is in this treasure island movie as well? Did he play Nicholas Cage's father in one of the National Treasure films? No, I think that was some other old white man. Who played Jumanji in The Da Vinci Code? Okay, I exaggerate. But I kid you not, The Lost City had me cross-fading between moving images from across decades nearly throughout its 114-minute runtime. Still, the Brothers Nee were clearly aware of what this kind of fairy-tale action comedy demanded. It does not instantly have the gravitas of a clever spoof, but it is not meant to be taken seriously either. The author at the centre of it writes out her own fantasies, and they turn out to be blockbusters. Romance, erotica, adventure, the works. She is done with this particular franchise of fantasy though. She is bored of the same pretty boy (Tatum) featuring on the cover of her novels. Perhaps age has something to do with it. In this cul-de-sac she finds herself in, she needs some new magic to carve her way out. Sensuousness and romance are non-negotiable on this journey for her. So are innuendo and"

No other genre has the capacity to elicit swooning and feminine escapism quite like it. The masculine man arrives to save the damsel in distress, bandits endlessly chase our heroes, and constant back and forths between will-they and won't-they scenarios are to be expected. It's unapologetically trite, and it just so happens to be both steamy and entertaining. This is why inserting Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum into The Lost City, a semi-romantic comedy/adventure, feels like it should be a home run. One is returning to her comedic chops, while the other is given a role meant to match his soft, mannish charm. Instead, the film is ashamed of its romantic sentimentality and, sometimes, even its own script. Actors feel like they're dilly-dallying on their lines for the sake of naturalism while someone in their earpiece is desperately dissuading them from veering off-topic to no avail. The film begins with sexually charged prose and sprinkles of meta-commentary. Loretta Sage (played by Sandra Bullock) is a romance-adventure novel writer who hates writing romance-adventure novels. She bemoans having to work with Alan Caprison (played by Channing Tatum), the doddering cover model who puts into flesh the imaginations of readers by posing as Dash McMahon, the hero of her book The Lost City of D. Loretta has expertise in Spanish history and anthropology, passions which she shared with her late husband (a detail barely even scratched) that she now includes in her books. Her latest book tour organized by her publicist Beth (played by the talented Da'Vine Joy Randolph), is disrupted when Loretta is kidnapped by an evil British billionaire, Abigail Fairfax (played by a hyperbolic Daniel Radcliffe). This prompts Alan, who has taken a liking to Loretta, to channel his inner Dash and hatch a rescue plan accompanied by his trainer, Jack Trainer (played suavely by Brad Pitt). What ensues is a smorgasbord of chaos and hilarity spearheaded by a colorful cast of side characters that instantly deflates whenever we cut back to Bullock and Tatum. Sandra Bullock, best known for her rom-com turn in The Proposal, her iconic fish-out-of-water pageant antics in Miss Congeniality, and the fearlessly spirited Annie Porter in Speed, plays an amalgamation of the above roles to mixed results. Everything about her character is a walking contradiction, not in an elevated sense, but a trifling one. She's a self-professed sapiosexual who writes sexually charged material that, in her eyes, lacks the substance worthy of her standards. She loathes the fact that her readers are impervious to her book's deeper anthropological meaning because they prefer ogling at the smutty details. This doesn't make her relatable; it does the opposite. I'd rather relate with the horny fanatics than the out-of-touch stuck-up. Ironically, the best part of the movie was the masculine man doing masculine things, the antithesis of what its meta-narrative wants to accomplish.

Two of Hollywood's most reliable stars, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, work together in The Lost City as both producers and leads to bring the screwball comedy back. They're successful in so far as the film plays true to a range of those 1930s bickering couple tropes; they're not so successful in giving the world anything new. But plenty of people are wanting their comfort food now and don't really want to be challenged. What is more comforting than the delightful Sandy B acting flustered and kooky, or the bare chest of Channing Tatum, a very frequent feature in this film? Bullock plays Loretta, the very successful author of a series of lucrative romance novels. Loretta's audience might love her romance series, but the author herself isn't a fan. She's a frustrated academic who wrote herself into a job she's not particularly passionate about. Tatum plays Alan, a himbo male model and the photographic cover star of Loretta's two dozen or so bodice-rippers. Alan isn't Loretta's cup of tea, either physically or intellectually, but her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) knows that Loretta's over-intellectualising is not what their audience wants to hear. As they have a new book to publicise, Alan is tagging along to do his thing. His thing is to dress up in the long blonde wig and open-chested shirt of his fictional alter ego Dash, hero of Loretta's novels. At book signings and media events, Loretta's patience is worn thin by the endless fan questions not about her book but asking Alan to take his shirt off. In this latest of her romance novels, Loretta has written her characters discovering a fabled lost city and its lucrative riches. Loretta actually knows what she is writing about here, having researched the site with her late archaeologist husband, and the billionaire magnate Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) recognises that this fluffy romance novel offers the closest clues to an archaeological gold mine. When Fairfax kidnaps Loretta, only Alan recognises the danger to her. Alan, who has secretly harboured feelings for her, hires a mercenary (Brad Pitt) to rescue her, and tags along himself. Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt, what a combo. Both in their own way enjoy a bit of scenery-chewing as trope-filled villain and hero roles. Rising comedic star Bowen Yang enjoys a good scene as one of the book tour Q&A moderators and Randolph should get arrested for stealing every scene she is in. Like the old Kathleen Turner-Michael Douglas Romancing the Stone films, the action segues between real life and fun scenes from the romance novels. Tatum performs well, and had me wondering the ninth time his shirt came off if it still exploitation when it's you doing the exploiting of yourself?

Certainly, the film is rarely romantic, only fleetingly comedic and its action set-pieces are underwhelming. But you can make out some faint glimmer of what it might be attempting. For a film with four credited script-writers and an additional fifth person with a ""story by"" credit, most of what ""The Lost City"" could or might be, is eclipsed by the aggressive nothingness of what it is an incredibly tepid film experience. A writer in her late-fifties finds herself thrust into an unlikely romance with a younger man. That's actually the plot for Nancy Meyer's ""Something's Gotta Give"", where Diane Keaton finds herself navigating potential romance with a younger Keanu Reeves and an older Jack Nicholson. But it did occur to me while watching, ""The Lost City"" where Sandra Bullock plays Loretta, a late-fifties writer who finds herself in an unlikely potential romance with a younger man (played by Channing Tatum) how different romance, or the illusion of it, looks like when a movie actually has something to say. And it's anyone's guess what, if anything, ""The Lost City"" has to say. The bones of the plot are straightforward enough Loretta is a widow who writes romance novels and is on a book tour when she's kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax, a nefarious billionaire looking for a lost city with an allegedly priceless treasure. Loretta's historical research with her deceased archaeologist husband has Fairfax convinced she can help him locate the treasure. In an attempt to convince Loretta of his devotion, her cover model (Tatum as Alan) embarks on a rescue mission to the remote Atlantic Island. Chaos ensues, then adventure and then romance. If that all sounds like a vaguely clumsy set-up for a film with so many writers, it's not the only case of ""The Lost City"" feeling defined by a general noncommittal energy. It's a perplexing tone for a film that carries a lot of weight. In a 'post-pandemic' world, the question of whether audiences will venture out to cinemas for anything beyond the spectacle of superhero fantasy is a big question. And the intentions of a mid-budget romantic comedy, led by a woman (Bullock also produces this) is a great idea. A world with more romantic comedies on the big-screen is a better world, especially ones that honour women over fifty. Yet, little of anything in ""The Lost City"" feels as exciting, or innovative or engaging as that potential might be. Is it a radical point to say that a film must both be romantic and comedic before it's allowed to market itself as a romantic comedy? Theoretically, it shouldn't, but increasingly the films going by the romcom moniker seem dispossessed of either the 'rom' or the 'com' leaving us with interminable sludges that elicit an ambivalent ""ummm"" more than anything.

The film has had some interesting stuff like: Felix coming back, Bond becoming a broken and wounded character that Craig did, the opening credits giving us a callback to some previous bond films, and even some emotional depth to the story. Madeline Swann was much better in this one and she's been given some more screen time. Although Felix Leiter and Blofeld's deaths were shocking, Daniel Craig's version of James Bond's death was sad and devastating, but a great end to Daniel Craig's tenure as bond. His performance was always electrifying and never disappoints me. He was also a great Bond as well, becoming more of a broken, wounded, cold, heavy and brutal Bond that he was from his 15 year run from the series. There were a couple of minor flaws sometimes, in which I can't remember in this flick. On the other hand, Ana de Armas was beautiful, funny, fantastic and kick's butt in action as Paloma. The action sequences were exciting, nail biting and suspenseful. There were some emotional moments and tense scenes and powerful moments too. Rami Malek as Safin, in my opinion was scary and creepy. The pre credits was really great and action packed as well. The score by Hans Zimmer was great too. Plus, the score having callbacks and musical cues of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Casino Royale was a nice touch and executed really well. Billie Eilish's song was chilling and haunting, it even fits well with the opening titles with callbacks to classic bond title sequences from past films like: Dr. No, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Goldfinger, From Russia with Love and some bits of Goldeneye and Die Another Day. Although Bond's death disappointed or confused some fans, to me; it's a really great and emotional scene for Craig to have his powerful and emotional end from his long serving run as James Bond, after 15 years. NOTE AND SPOILER ALERT: Make sure to stay during and until the end of the closing credits, because the credits say and confirm the four words that every Bond fan wants to see: ""JAMES BOND WILL RETURN."" Yes, we're actually going to get another Bond film in the near future with a new actor coming on board. Hopefully when Bond 26 gets underway for sometime, we're hoping the next Bond can bring another or similar take to either actor who formerly played bond and maybe go back to the old fashioned and fun Bond that we've missed and had from 1962 through 2002. Go check this film out, you don't want to miss it! We can't wait to see who the next James Bond will be for Bond 26 in the near future. I hope that Henry Cavill gets the Bond role. Even though the film may not gross that much as other films from the past did, I hope the film gets"

Bonds story of his life has been continuing since 1962 and then they just killed him off. Tons of better ways to write that movie. Tons of differnt things they couldve done with craigs last film. Really all the last film did was put a bad taste in peoples mouths about the films. Great movie and acting. But very poorly executed. They wouldve been better off making NO time to die as a in star wars lingo. NON CANNON so in other words it doesnt follow the Bond time line at all but is still called a bond film. Like Never Say Never again great movie but some dont like it as its the same story almost as Thunderball with Sean. And is not a albert R broccoli or how ever its spelt movie. 1962 DR.No 1969 On her Majestys Secret Service. Bond wife dies in a assassination attempt to kill Bond. 1981 Bonds wife is shown barried in a cemetery with her headstone saying she passed away in 1969 as if Rodger Moores Bond is the same Bond as Sean but just mearly a differnt personality of Bond. 1989 bonds wife is mentioned again by Felix lighter saying bond had a wife a long time ago. Also as a continuation of Bonds life. Because correct me if im wrong but it seems like I dont recall Dalton ever getting married to another Women. I didnt mind in craigs film bringing back Blofeld as hes a cool villain but they shoulve not killed him off just like like that. Another note. In 1994 goldeneye was made but as shown in the movie it states that after 006 was killed in its 9 years later so current time now. That being said it wouldve been 1986 a year before Daltons first film. So does that mean Pierce was supposed to be in The living daylight and license to kill? Or does that mean Dalton was supposed to be in his two films as well as Goldeneye? I realize Dalton was going to be In goldeneye but there was license issues or something going on for years and so that when they replaced Dalton after. But since the movies over lap shouldnt that mean Dalton and Pierce are one of the same person? Dont get me wrong I love 007 films. I re watch them constantly. They just really havent been thinking out the storyline very well. Alot of rebuilding is due now after the crap that theyve done with the films. Craig isnt gets alot of crap for his role as Bond but its not his fault. I remember watching tomb raider when it came out and my sister saying that Daniel will definitely be the next bond that was years before they even started to talk about Pierce's replacement. She so called it. Same thing after watching Mrs. Doubtfire in 1993 me and my sister both said Brosnan was going to take that slot
172,JRG_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,JRG_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,JRG,Action,Negative,No_Time_to_Die,"For those whose cinematic consciousness predates ""Star Wars,"" the James Bond series may be the primordial experience of franchise films, with all the pleasures and limitations that they entail. The appealing predictability of familiar characters and the excitement of seeing variations on their themes has always gone hand in hand with a sense of overmanagementof the strings being pulled by some puppeteer far from the set. The feeling that what's onscreen is inseparable from the demands of the balance sheet has never been absent from the Bond market, and the five entries starring Daniel Craig have only intensified it. Together, the Craig films interconnect to form a sort of Bond cinematic universe whose parts slot all too neatly into a series, with all the dramatic engineering that it implies. The most recent and final Craig film, ""No Time to Die,"" directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, is in that sense a culmination of the series' necessities, with the boardroom and the writers' room virtually taking the place of any cinematic action. On the other hand, the series' essential virtue was always its extravagant exaggerationsit was gloriously ridiculous and gloriously lacking in self-awareness, its macho ribaldry invested with absurdly high purpose. In the Daniel Craig era, there's no sense of unconscious or excess expressionit has been digitized out along with any intentional humor. The devices that Bond and his compatriots use are hardly a step from Maxwell Smart's shoe phone, as are the switch-operated gizmos of his Aston Martin. Yet their depiction and use are so perfunctory that they're presented as neither silly nor ordinary, just checked off. Craig is a great actor who brings a distinctive affect to Bondclenched, airtight, impenetrable, abraded. He makes Bond's social graces seem like the product of work that's harder than the athleticized superhero business imposed upon the character. Craig's distinctive persona suggests pathos that the series doesn't allow; instead, he's merely used as a Bond-pinata, a straining for an element of realism amid stunts that, in their grandiosity and their excess, preclude it. In ""No Time to Die,"" Bond is launched with mourning and melancholy: he and his new partner, Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), visit the Italian town of Matera, where the tomb of Vesper Lynd (from ""Casino Royale"") is found. Bond visits her tombwhich explodes, as a prelude to a mighty chase and shoot-out. He survives but immediately ends the romance with Madeleine, whom he suspects of setting him up. Five years later, Bond, retired to Jamaica, gets a visit from an old associate, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), of the C.I.A., along with a smarmy young State Department official named Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen). They want Bond's help in finding a scientist named Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik), who has been kidnapped from a high-security bioweapon facility with a dreadful concoction in hand: a mortal virus-like nanobot, transmitted on contact and engineered to target specific DNA markers, whether of an individual, a family, or an ethnicity. But it takes a visit, that very night, from"

Bond, like Norma Desmond, is once again ready for his closeup and Daniel Craig once again shows us his handsome-Shrek face and the lovable bat ears, flecked with the scars of yesterday's punch-up, the lips as ever pursed in determination or disgust. And Craig's final film as the diva of British intelligence is an epic barnstormer, with the script from Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge delivering pathos, drama, camp comedy (Bond will call M ""darling"" in moments of tetchiness), heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action in a movie which calls to mind the world of Dr No on his island. Director Cary Fukunaga delivers it with terrific panache, and the film also shows us a romantic Bond, a uxorious Bond, a Bond who is unafraid of showing his feelings, like the old softie he's turned out to be. A queasy and dreamlike prelude hints at a terrible formative trauma in the childhood of Dr Madeleine Swann (a gorgeously reserved Lea Seydoux), that enigmatic figure we saw in the last movie who is now enjoying a romantic getaway with James. But a shocking act of violence destroys their idyll, as we knew it must, and Bond has some spectacular stunts as he hurls himself from a bridge. It all has a lot to do with a sinister biowarfare plan called ""Heracles"" being developed by M (Ralph Fiennes) using a renegade scientist Obruchev (David Dencik) but both creepy boffin and weapon are stolen in a sequence of preposterous action comedy, incidentally involving a sullen, bickering functionary played in cameo by Hugh Dennis. Both MI6 and the CIA want Obruchev back but British intelligence does not care to involve Bond who is now in retirement in Jamaica, perhaps in tribute to Ian Fleming's holiday retreat, and M has handed over his 007 status to a new agent Nomi, stylishly played by Lashana Lynch. But the Americans, in the form of his old buddy Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and an uptight new state department appointee Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen) persuade Bond to take on the job as a freelance, and send him to Cuba, where he liaises with an untrained operative: Paloma a witty and unworldly turn from Ana de Armas whose rapport with Craig recalls their chemistry in Knives Out. The Cuban nightclub scene has something genuinely bizarre about it, bringing us a henchman with a surreal glass eye. The awful truth is that M has allowed ""Heracles"" to be compromised by the creepy Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who is being kept by the Brits in Lecter-ish imprisonment, but has managed to direct this new plan from his hi-tech cell, but who is now himself under attack by the"
174,JRG_Doc5_No_Time_to_Die,JRG_Doc5_No_Time_to_Die,JRG,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"""No Time to Die"" is a terrific movie: an up-to-the-minute, down-to-the-wire James Bond thriller with a satisfying neoclassical edge. It's an unabashedly conventional Bond film that's been made with high finesse and just the right touch of soul, as well as enough sleek surprise to keep you on edge. Before I go further, though, let me lay my baccarat cards on the table. I thought ""Casino Royale,"" the first film in which Daniel Craig portrayed 007, was the greatest Bond film since the early Sean Connery days, and in many ways the most perfectly realized Bond movie ever. (I've seen it countless times, and it's one of my favorite films of its era.) To me, the trio of Bond films that came after ""Casino Royale"" have added up to one of the most profoundly disappointing follow-throughs of any contemporary film series. ""Quantum of Solace"" was all trumped-up mechanics, ""Spectre"" was an elaborate piece of product that went through the motions and ""Skyfall,"" though I realize many Bond watchers think it's a masterpiece, was, to me, sodden and overstated, with a meta-hammy megalomaniac performance by Javier Bardem and a backstory to Bond that was maudlin with self-pity. The film was trying to be ""emotional,"" but that poor-little-spy-boy origin story didn't enlarge Bond it diminished him. The truth is that so many elements of what the Bond films originally brought to cinema have been incorporated into other film series the ""Mission: Impossible"" films, the ""Bourne"" films, the ""Fast and Furious"" films that to create a first-rate Bond adventure, something more is required. You need an ingenious weave of elements: the perfect layered rhythm of brashly timed fights and great escapes and bedazzling chases and delectable quips and cool gadgets and sexy one-upmanship and the ultimate in world-domination stakes. ""No Time to Die,"" at 2 hours and 43 minutes, is the longest Bond film ever, yet it's brisk and heady and sharp. The director, Cary Joji Fukunaga (HBO's ""True Detective""), keeps the elements in balance like an ace juggler. He gets the details right the split-second leaping-off-the-balcony action scenes, the menace of an assassin with a vagrant mechanical eyeball, the persnickety droll fun of Ben Whishaw's performance as Q. Beyond that, though, there needs to be a touch of mystery to Bond. That's the quality that ""Casino Royale"" brought back to the series through its fantastically tricky dramatization of the relationship between Craig's fast, steely, roughneck Bond and Eva Green's insinuating Vesper Lynd. And ""No Time to Die,"" though it's not the work of art ""Casino Royale"" was, possesses just enough of that quality. Ideally, there's a romance to a James Bond movie I don't just mean a love story, but a romance to Bond's presence, a grander motive behind the ruthless execution of his every move. ""No Time to Die"" has that. In the introductory sequence, we see Lea Seydoux's Madeleine as a young girl and the cataclysm she endured at the hands of a man in a white mask who came"
175,JRG_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,JRG_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,JRG,Action,Negative,No_Time_to_Die,"Hi. I'm Cary Fukunaga, and I am the director of No Time to Die. In this scene, we have Daniel Craig, playing James Bond, narrowly surviving a deadly attack by Specter at the Tomb of Vesper Lynd. This was one of those interesting situations where the locations drove the inspiration for story. So I went on a scout trip with Mark Tildesley, our production designer, and Linus Sandgren, cinematographer. And I really loved this bridge in Gravina. It seemed like the perfect place to run a stunt. We had a drone, and we were flying the drone around the bridge to see, what could we do with it? Could he jump off, potentially? It could be an ambush site. So we just literally designed the action sequence to the locations that we were finding. This sequence was shot on IMAX, which also meant that the movements of the cameras, the ease with which we could cover multiple angles, was hindered by the number of cameras we actually had. The IMAX cameras are massive. I mean, the kind of cameras when you pick them up, it makes you want to swear. But sometimes we just had to do the stunt over and over again and just move the camera around, because you only had two, maybe three, working IMAX cameras at the time. Which is not a lot, normally, when you're covering a big stunt. Normally, you would have five cameras placed all over the place. So we had to be very, I would say, surgical about how the camera moved, how many takes we could do before we were running out of time. We see him try to outsmart them and outrun them, but they get a sense of where he's headed. We do a Texas switch. And basically, you see Bond on camera. And as we pan over, it's actually a stunt double running in, not Bond, to tackle Primo on the motorcycle. And then, when we cut up closer, we do that in one take. So all the punches have to land perfectly so that it looks like each one is actually connecting when, in reality, there was safety and space between them."" ""Blofeld sends his regards."" The director Cary Joji Fukunaga narrates an action sequence from his film featuring Daniel Craig. ""No Time to Die."" It's kind of an ambiguous title. No time because we're too busy or because now is not the right moment? The makers of the latest James Bond film have generously supplied us with 163 minutes including a slow-moving Billie Eilish theme song during which we can ponder this and other urgent questions. That's in addition to the nearly 18 months of pandemic delay that we have waited for this episode (the 25th overall and Daniel Craig's last in the role of the least secret member of Her Majesty's Secret Service). It arrives with a curious mixture of heaviness and insouciance. Mortality looms over the quips and car chases not only the expected"
176,JRG_Doc7_No_Time_to_Die,JRG_Doc7_No_Time_to_Die,JRG,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die,"No Time to Die, the 27th movie in the James Bond franchise and the last to star Daniel Craig, isn't the best Bond movie. Yet it may be the greatest. At two hours and 43 minutes, it's too long and too overstuffed with plotmore isn't always better. And it features one of the dullest villains in the series' history, played by Rami Malek in mottled skin and dumb silky PJs. But forget all that. No Time to Die, its flaws notwithstanding, is perfectly tailored to the actor who is, to me, the best Bond of all. With his fifth movie as 007, Craig is so extraordinary he leaves only scorched earth behind. There will be other Bonds for those who want them. For everyone else, there's Craig. A summary of No Time to Die's labyrinthine plot would be boring to write and even more boring to read, so here are a few bullet points: The evil scheme engineered by Malek's inscrutably named Lyutsifer Safin involves bioengineered weapons tailored to an individual's DNA; his plan is to threaten to infect the world, for no known reason other than pure villainy. Bond's love interest is MI6 shrink Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), introduced in 2015's Spectre, and she may or may not be above boardbecause although Bond is always a man of his word, he often has good reason to doubt others' loyalty. There's an assassin skulking around in a spooky white Noh mask. The current and extremely likable incarnation of the franchise's second-bananas, Naomie Harris' Miss Moneypenny and Ben Whishaw's Q, both get adequate screen-time (and Q has a hairless cat for a pet, occasioning one of Bond's driest quips). Bond, who's retired as the movie opens, has been replaced by a smart, peppery new agent, Nomi (Lashana Lynch), whom he doesn't like one bitat least at first. The action sequences are cleanly shot and edited and generally superb: a car chase in a sun-drenched Italian village is a highlightwho doesn't love watching a Bond vehicle rattle down a set of stone steps? Ana de Armas shows up all too briefly and is awesome. And there's a guy with a computerized fake eyeball that's occasionally given to popping out and rolling aroundeverything about this phony eyeball is funny. There. Now that that's out of the way, we can talk about Craig. Because that's really what you came here for, isn't it? The early scenes of No Time to Die are so swoonily romantic that you know none of it can last: Bond and Madeleine have swept into that little Italian town on a cloud of amour; the minute they close the door on their picturesque hotel room, they tumble into each other's arms and into bed. On the drive up, along those characteristically twisty Italian roads, Madeleine had urged Bond to drive faster. He looked at her, amused but also sure of the words he was about to speak, and said, ""We have all the time in the world."" The man who"

""Goodbye"" isn't usually in the spy's vocabularynot with a sequel always on the horizon, a return always promised in the credits. Even on the cusp of recasting, it's rare to get any finality from a Bond movie; producers like to leave the door open, in hopes that they'll lure their star back for one more round of martinis. No Time To Die is different. It's been conceived as a proper send-off to Daniel Craig, taking his fifth and final spin in the tuxedo, and as an attempt to wrap up this serialized stretch of a series that's been running since the early '60s. Unfortunately, the film is so concerned with valediction that it ends up treating the actual pleasures of Bondthe stuff that's kept audiences coming back for six decadeslike an afterthought. It's all punctuation, no sentence. In devising some closure of sorts for this iteration of the character, No Time To Die looks backwards. This has been a strategy of the series ever since Craig took over the role, bringing a more brutish charisma to cinema's most beloved secret agent. An obsession with the past was, of course, a driving principle of the thrilling origin story Casino Royale. And it hung over the films that followed, evident in every self-conscious wink at the ancient tropes of the 007 formula and every attempt to tie a new menace to an old mission, mistake, or adversary. In its smartest stab at symmetry, No Time To Die takes Bond back to Italy, and to the grave of the woman whose death shaped his future. Her tombstone literally explodes. Metaphorically, this signals a fallout with the one woman Bond has allowed himself to love since, the psychiatrist Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux, reprising the role she played in Spectre)."

It brings back the classic, legendary Blofeld villain (whose rights took the Bond producers decades to secure), and, for once, he sports the same face as in the prior film. It didn't simply dismiss the pivotal Madeleine character (Lea Seydoux) like these movies have done with dozens of other Bond Girls. It brings back a full palette of colors to the screen, most of which ""Spectre"" inexplicably omitted. ""No Time to Die"" also includes other classic elements from Bond's past that I wasn't expecting such as a stop in Jamaica, 007's spiritual home, and the site of a couple of his most memorable missions. It features one of the most overlooked Aston Martins from Bond's past. It even brings back some of John Barry's finest compositions from the early entries to the series and they are every bit as memorable as Monty Norman's (and Barry's own) James Bond theme. More importantly, ""No Time to Die"" ties up every imaginable loose end from the Craig era, a five-entry parenthesis within the 25-picture/60-year-old series. ""No Time to Die"" deals with Bond coming out of retirement five years after we last saw him ride into the sunset in the DB5 with Madeleine in ""Spectre."" When a dangerous weapon is stolen from the British Government by villainous Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), Bond is brought back to action by his old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Safin has a running feud with Bond enemy Ernst Stavro Bloferd (Christoph Waltz) while Bond develops a friendlier rivalry of his own with Nomi (Lashana Lynch), another double 00 agent assigned to the same case. ""No Time to Die"" is one of the few films in the series that doesn't start on its feet with Bond in the middle of a mission, which is one of the greatest charms of these movies. Instead, we get a flashback sto an event that's pretty much described in its entirety in ""Spectre"" with a child falling through the same ice on a lake that an adult inexplicably doesn't crack. Considering that I found myself meandering during what's usually the most exciting part of these movies, and that the sequence could have easily fit anywhere else in the picture, I think the decision to place the scene here was a mistake. We then get to the real meat of the pre-title sequence, a chase sequence that reprises the sight of Bond in front of the grave of a loved one from ""For Your Eyes Only."" These events turned out to be orchestrated though, I have a hard time understanding why Blofeld would feel the need to frame a character in the eyes of Bond if he's making such an effort to kill him anyway. Even though the action comes in the wake of several fantastic eccentricities from Bond's pre-title past, such as 007 parachuting"

Cary Joji Fukunaga's film stars Daniel Craig, in his final appearance as James Bond, and Lea Seydoux.Illustration by Clement Soulmagnon Abig welcome back to 007. The news is that nothing much has changed, and all the fixtures and fittings are in place. The license to kill, and the supple deployment of weaponry. The occasional whip of a wisecrack. The prime spot in the cockpit of an aircraft. The Aston Martin. The dress sense. The knockout shades. No question about it: she's the right woman for the job. As we are reminded by the latest chapter in the franchise, ""No Time to Die,"" 007 is not a person so much as a designated slot. Once vacated, it fills up like a parking space. Thus, when James Bond (Daniel Craig)male, pale, and staled by years of trouncing megalomaniacsgoes off the grid, his prized 00 number is taken by Nomi (Lashana Lynch), who is proud, Black, younger than springtime, and much amused by the autumnal state of her predecessor. ""You get in my way, I will put a bullet in your knee,"" she says to him, adding, ""The one that works."" Harsh. They meet in Jamaica, whither Bond has retired. (Lord knows what he does all day. Maybe he sets off with a pair of binoculars, a packed lunch, and a copy of ""Birds of the West Indies,"" by James Bond, the American ornithologist from whom Ian Fleming, another Jamaica resident, pinched the name.) Nomi is on the trail of villainy, and Bond has been asked to follow the same scentnot by the British government but by the C.I.A., in the person of Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Who'd have guessed that the cream of Her Majesty's spies would end up being milked by Uncle Sam? Is that why the opening credits show the symbolic figure of Britannia, with her trusty shield, falling into a giant hourglass and slipping away into the sands of time? The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, runs almost two and three-quarter hours. That's a lot of movie, longer than some recordings of the St. Matthew Passion, but Fukunaga has a lot of ground to cover.
